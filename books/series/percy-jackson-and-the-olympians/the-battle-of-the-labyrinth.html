                    <p class="calibre13">The last thing I wanted to do on my summer break was blow up another school.
                        But there I was
                        Monday morning, the first week of June, sitting in my mom’s car in front of Goode High School on
                        East 81st. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Goode was this big brownstone building overlooking the East River. A bunch of
                        BMWs and Lincoln
                        Town Cars were parked out front. Staring up at the fancy stone archway, I wondered how long it
                        would take me to
                        get kicked out of this place. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just relax.” My mom didn’t sound relaxed. “It’s only an orientation tour. And
                        remember, dear,
                        this is Paul’s school. So try not to…you know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Destroy it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Paul Blofis, my mom’s boyfriend, was standing out front, greeting future ninth
                        graders as they
                        came up the steps. With his salt-and-pepper hair, denim clothes, and leather jacket, he reminded
                        me of a TV
                        actor, but he was just an English teacher. He’d managed to convince Goode High School to accept
                        me for ninth
                        grade, despite the fact that I’d gotten kicked out of every school I’d ever attended. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d tried to warn him it wasn’t a good idea, but he wouldn’t listen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at my mom. “You haven’t told him the truth about me, have you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She tapped her fingers nervously on the wheel. She was dressed up for a job
                        interview—her best
                        blue dress and high-heeled shoes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I thought we should wait,” she admitted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So we don’t scare him away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sure orientation will be fine, Percy. It’s only one morning.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Great,” I mumbled. “I can get expelled before I even start the school year.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Think positive. Tomorrow you’re off to camp! After orientation, you’ve got
                        your date—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s not a date!” I protested. “It’s just Annabeth, Mom. Jeez!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She’s coming all the way from camp to meet you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re going to the movies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just the two of you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She held up her hands in surrender, but I could tell she was trying hard not to
                        smile. “You’d
                        better get inside, dear. I’ll see you tonight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to get out of the car when I looked over at the steps of the
                        school. Paul Blofis
                        was greeting a girl with frizzy red hair. She wore a maroon T-shirt and ratty jeans decorated
                        with marker
                        drawings. When she turned, I caught a glimpse of her face, and the hairs on my arms stood
                        straight up. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy?” my mom asked. “What’s wrong?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“N-nothing,” I stammered. “Does the school have a side entrance?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Down the block on the right. Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll see you later.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mom started to say something, but I got out of the car and ran, hoping the
                        redheaded girl
                        wouldn’t see me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">What was <i class="calibre5">she </i>doing here? Not even <i
                            class="calibre5">my </i>luck could
                        be this bad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Yeah, right. I was about to find out my luck could get a whole lot worse. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Sneaking into orientation didn’t work out too well. Two cheerleaders in
                        purple-and-white
                        uniforms were standing at the side entrance, waiting to ambush freshmen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi!” They smiled, which I figured was the first and last time any cheerleaders
                        would be that
                        friendly to me. One was blond with icy blue eyes. The other was African American with dark curly
                        hair like
                        Medusa’s (and believe me, I know what I’m talking about). Both girls had their names stitched in
                        cursive on
                        their uniforms, but with my dyslexia, the words looked like meaningless spaghetti. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Welcome to Goode,” the blond girl said. “You are <i class="calibre5">so
                        </i>going to love it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But as she looked me up and down, her expression said something more like, <i
                            class="calibre5">Eww, who is this loser? </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The other girl stepped uncomfortably close to me. I studied the stitching on
                        her uniform and
                        made out <i class="calibre5">Kelli</i>. She smelled like roses and something else I recognized
                        from riding
                        lessons at camp—the scent of freshly washed horses. It was a weird smell for a cheerleader.
                        Maybe she owned a
                        horse or something. Anyway, she stood so close I got the feeling she was going to try to push me
                        down the steps.
                        “What’s your name, fish?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fish?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Freshman.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The girls exchanged looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Percy Jackson,” the blond one said. “We’ve been waiting for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That sent a major <i class="calibre5">Uh-oh </i>chill down my back. They were
                        blocking the
                        entrance, smiling in a not-very-friendly way. My hand crept instinctively toward my pocket,
                        where I kept my
                        lethal ballpoint pen, Riptide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then another voice came from inside the building: “Percy?” It was Paul Blofis,
                        somewhere down
                        the hallway. I’d never been so glad to hear his voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The cheerleaders backed off. I was so anxious to get past them I accidentally
                        kneed Kelli in
                        the thigh. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clang. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her leg made a hollow, metallic sound, like I’d just hit a flagpole. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ow,” she muttered. “Watch it, <i class="calibre5">fish</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I glanced down, but her leg looked like a regular old leg. I was too freaked
                        out to ask
                        questions. I dashed into the hall, the cheerleaders laughing behind me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There you are!” Paul told me. “Welcome to Goode!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, Paul—uh, Mr. Blofis.” I glanced back, but the weird cheerleaders had
                        disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, uh—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Paul clapped me on the back. “Listen, I know you’re nervous, but don’t worry.
                        We get a lot of
                        kids here with ADHD and dyslexia. The teachers know how to help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I almost wanted to laugh. If only ADHD and dyslexia were my biggest worries. I
                        mean, I knew
                        Paul was trying to help, but if I told him the truth about me, he’d either think I was crazy or
                        he’d run away
                        screaming. Those cheerleaders, for instance. I had a bad feeling about them…. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I looked down the hall, and I remembered I had another problem. The
                        redheaded girl I’d
                        seen on the front steps was just coming in the main entrance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Don’t notice me, </i>I prayed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She noticed me. Her eyes widened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where’s the orientation?” I asked Paul. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The gym. That way. But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Bye.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy?” he called, but I was already running. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought I’d lost her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bunch of kids were heading for the gym, and soon I was just one of three
                        hundred
                        fourteen-year-olds all crammed into the bleachers. A marching band played an out-of-tune fight
                        song that sounded
                        like somebody hitting a bag of cats with a metal baseball bat. Older kids, probably student
                        council members,
                        stood up front modeling the Goode school uniform and looking all, <i class="calibre5">Hey, we’re
                            cool</i>.
                        Teachers milled around, smiling and shaking hands with students. The walls of the gym were
                        plastered with big
                        purple-and-white banners that said WELCOME FUTURE FRESHMEN, GOODE IS GOOD, WE’RE ALL FAMILY, and
                        a bunch of
                        other happy slogans that pretty much made me want to throw up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">None of the other freshmen looked thrilled to be here, either. I mean, coming
                        to orientation in
                        June, when school doesn’t even start until September, is not cool. But at Goode, “We prepare to
                        excel early!” At
                        least that’s what the brochure said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The marching band stopped playing. A guy in a pinstripe suit came to the
                        microphone and started
                        talking, but the sound echoed around the gym so I had no idea what he was saying. He might’ve
                        been gargling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Someone grabbed my shoulder. “What are you doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was her: my redheaded nightmare. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Rachel Elizabeth Dare,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her jaw dropped like she couldn’t believe I had the nerve to remember her name.
                        “And you’re
                        Percy somebody. I didn’t get your full name last December when you tried to <i
                            class="calibre5">kill </i>me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, I wasn’t—I didn’t—What are <i class="calibre5">you </i>doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Same as you, I guess. Orientation.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You live in New York?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What, you thought I lived at Hoover Dam?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It had never occurred to me. Whenever I thought about her (and I’m <i
                            class="calibre5">not
                        </i>saying I <i class="calibre5">thought </i>about her; she just like crossed my mind from time
                        to time, okay?),
                        I always figured she lived in the Hoover Dam area, since that’s where I’d met her. We’d spent
                        maybe ten minutes
                        together, during which time I’d accidentally swung a sword at her, she’d saved my life, and I’d
                        run away chased
                        by a band of supernatural killing machines. You know, your typical chance meeting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Some guy behind us whispered, “Hey, shut up. The cheerleaders are talking!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi, guys!” a girl bubbled into the microphone. It was the blonde I’d seen at
                        the entrance. “My
                        name is Tammi, and this is, like, Kelli.” Kelli did a cartwheel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Next to me, Rachel yelped like someone had stuck her with a pin. A few kids
                        looked over and
                        snickered, but Rachel just stared at the cheerleaders in horror. Tammi didn’t seem to notice the
                        outburst. She
                        started talking about all the great ways we could get involved during our freshman year. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Run,” Rachel told me. “Now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Rachel didn’t explain. She pushed her way to the edge of the bleachers,
                        ignoring the frowning
                        teachers and grumbling kids she was stepping on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hesitated. Tammi was explaining how we were about to break into small groups
                        and tour the
                        school. Kelli caught my eye and gave me an amused smile, like she was waiting to see what I’d
                        do. It would look
                        bad if I left right now. Paul Blofis was down there with the rest of the teachers. He’d wonder
                        what was wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I thought about Rachel Elizabeth Dare, and the special ability she’d shown
                        last winter at
                        Hoover Dam. She’d been able to see a group of security guards who weren’t guards at all, who
                        weren’t even human.
                        My heart pounding, I got up and followed her out of the gym. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I found Rachel in the band room. She was hiding behind a bass drum in the
                        percussion section.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Get over here!” she said. “Keep your head down!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt pretty silly hiding behind a bunch of bongos, but I crouched beside her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Did they follow you?” Rachel asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean the cheerleaders?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She nodded nervously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t think so,” I said. “What are they? What did you see?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her green eyes were bright with fear. She had a sprinkle of freckles on her
                        face that reminded
                        me of constellations. Her maroon T-shirt read HARVARD ART DEPT. “You…you wouldn’t believe me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, yeah, I would,” I promised. “I know you can see through the Mist.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Mist. It’s…well, it’s like this veil that hides the way things really are.
                        Some mortals
                        are born with the ability to see through it. Like you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She studied me carefully. “You did that at Hoover Dam. You called me a mortal.
                        Like you’re
                        not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt like punching a bongo. What was I thinking? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could never explain. I shouldn’t even try. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tell me,” she begged. “You know what it means. All these horrible things I
                        see?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, this is going to sound weird. Do you know anything about Greek myths?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Like…the Minotaur and the Hydra?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, just try not to say those names when I’m around, okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And the Furies,” she said, warming up. “And the Sirens, and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay!” I looked around the band hall, sure that Rachel was going to make a
                        bunch of
                        bloodthirsty nasties pop out of the walls; but we were still alone. Down the hallway, I heard a
                        mob of kids
                        coming out of the gymnasium. They were starting the group tours. We didn’t have long to talk.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All those monsters,” I said, “all the Greek gods— they’re real.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I knew it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I would’ve been more comfortable if she’d called me a liar, but Rachel looked
                        like I’d just
                        confirmed her worst suspicion. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You don’t know how hard it’s been,” she said. “For years I thought I was going
                        crazy. I
                        couldn’t tell anybody. I couldn’t—” Her eyes narrowed. “Wait. Who are you? I mean <i
                            class="calibre5">really</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m not a monster.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, I know that. I could <i class="calibre5">see </i>if you were. You look
                        like…you. But
                        you’re not human, are you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I swallowed. Even though I’d had three years to get used to who I was, I’d
                        never talked about
                        it with a regular mortal before—I mean, except for my mom, but she already knew. I don’t know
                        why, but I took
                        the plunge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m a half-blood,” I said. “I’m half human.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And half what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Just then Tammi and Kelli stepped into the band room. The doors slammed shut
                        behind them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There you are, Percy Jackson,” Tammi said. “It’s time for your orientation.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“They’re horrible!” Rachel gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tammi and Kelli were still wearing their purple-and-white cheerleader costumes,
                        holding
                        pom-poms from the rally. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do they really look like?” I asked, but Rachel seemed too stunned to
                        answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, forget her.” Tammi gave me a brilliant smile and started walking toward
                        us. Kelli stayed
                        by the doors, blocking our exit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They’d trapped us. I knew we’d have to fight our way out, but Tammi’s smile was
                        so dazzling it
                        distracted me. Her blue eyes were beautiful, and the way her hair swept over her shoulders…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Rachel warned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said something really intelligent like, “Uhhh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tammi was getting closer. She held out her pom-poms. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Rachel’s voice seemed to be coming from a long way away. “Snap out of
                        it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It took all my willpower, but I got my pen out of my pocket and uncapped it.
                        Riptide grew into
                        a three-foot-long bronze sword, its blade glowing with a faint golden light. Tammi’s smile
                        turned to a sneer.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, come on,” she protested. “You don’t need that. How about a kiss instead?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She smelled like roses and clean animal fur—a weird but somehow intoxicating
                        smell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Rachel pinched my arm, hard. “Percy, she wants to bite you! Look at her!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She’s just jealous.” Tammi looked back at Kelli. “May I, mistress?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kelli was still blocking the door, licking her lips hungrily. “Go ahead, Tammi.
                        You’re doing
                        fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tammi took another step forward, but I leveled the tip of my sword at her
                        chest. “Get back.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She snarled. “Freshmen,” she said with disgust. “This is <i
                            class="calibre5">our </i>school,
                        half-blood. We feed on whom we choose!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she began to change. The color drained out of her face and arms. Her skin
                        turned as white
                        as chalk, her eyes completely red. Her teeth grew into fangs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A vampire!” I stammered. Then I noticed her legs. Below the cheerleader skirt,
                        her left leg
                        was brown and shaggy with a donkey’s hoof. Her right leg was shaped like a human leg, but it was
                        made of bronze.
                        “Uhh, a vampire with—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t mention the legs!” Tammi snapped. “It’s rude to make fun!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She advanced on her weird, mismatched legs. She looked totally bizarre,
                        especially with the
                        pom-poms, but I couldn’t laugh—not facing those red eyes and sharp fangs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A vampire, you say?” Kelli laughed. “That silly legend was based on <i
                            class="calibre5">us</i>, you fool. We are <i class="calibre5">empousai</i>, servants of
                        Hecate.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mmmm.” Tammi edged closer to me. “Dark magic formed us from animal, bronze,
                        and ghost! We
                        exist to feed on the blood of young men. Now come, give me that kiss!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She bared her fangs. I was so paralyzed I couldn’t move, but Rachel threw a
                        snare drum at the
                        <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>’s head.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The demon hissed and batted the drum away. It went rolling along the aisles
                        between music
                        stands, its springs rattling against the drumhead. Rachel threw a xylophone, but the demon just
                        swatted that
                        away, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t usually kill girls,” Tammi growled. “But for you, mortal, I’ll make an
                        exception. Your
                        eyesight is a little <i class="calibre5">too </i>good!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She lunged at Rachel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” I slashed with Riptide. Tammi tried to dodge my blade, but I sliced
                        straight through her
                        cheerleader uniform, and with a horrible wail she exploded into dust all over Rachel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Rachel coughed. She looked like she’d just had a sack of flour dumped on her
                        head. “Gross!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Monsters do that,” I said. “Sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You killed my trainee!” Kelli yelled. “You need a lesson in school spirit,
                        half-blood!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she too began to change. Her wiry hair turned to flickering flames. Her
                        eyes turned red.
                        She grew fangs. She loped toward us, her brass foot and hoof clopping unevenly on the band-room
                        floor. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I am senior <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>,” she growled. “No hero has bested
                        me in a
                        thousand years.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah?” I said. “Then you’re overdue!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kelli was a lot faster than Tammi. She dodged my first strike and rolled into
                        the brass
                        section, knocking over a row of trombones with a mighty crash. Rachel scrambled out of the way.
                        I put myself
                        between her and the <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>. Kelli circled us, her eyes going from me to
                        the sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Such a pretty little blade,” she said. “What a shame it stands between us.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her form shimmered—sometimes a demon, sometimes a pretty cheerleader. I tried
                        to keep my mind
                        focused, but it was really distracting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Poor dear.” Kelli chuckled. “You don’t even know what’s happening, do you?
                        Soon, your pretty
                        little camp in flames, your friends made slaves to the Lord of Time, and there’s nothing you can
                        do to stop it.
                        It would be merciful to end your life now, before you have to see that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">From down the hall, I heard voices. A tour group was approaching. A man was
                        saying something
                        about locker combinations. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>’s eyes lit up. “Excellent! We’re about to
                        have company!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She picked up a tuba and threw it at me. Rachel and I ducked. The tuba sailed
                        over our heads
                        and crashed through the window. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The voices in the hall died down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Kelli shouted, pretending to be scared, “why did you throw that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was too surprised to answer. Kelli picked up a music stand and swiped a row
                        of clarinets and
                        flutes. Chairs and musical instruments crashed to the floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stop it!” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">People were tromping down the hall now, coming in our direction. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Time to greet our visitors!” Kelli bared her fangs and ran for the doors. I
                        charged after her
                        with Riptide. I had to stop her from hurting the mortals. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, don’t!” Rachel shouted. But I hadn’t realized what Kelli was up to
                        until it was too
                        late. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kelli flung open the doors. Paul Blofis and a bunch of freshmen stepped back in
                        shock. I raised
                        my sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the last second, the <i class="calibre5">empousa </i>turned toward me like a
                        cowering
                        victim. “Oh no, please!” she cried. I couldn’t stop my blade. It was already in motion. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Just before the celestial bronze hit her, Kelli exploded into flames like a
                        Molotov cocktail.
                        Waves of fire splashed over everything. I’d never seen a monster do that before, but I didn’t
                        have time to
                        wonder about it. I backed into the band room as flames engulfed the doorway. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy?” Paul Blofis looked completely stunned, staring at me from across the
                        fire. “What have
                        you done?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kids screamed and ran down the hall. The fire alarm wailed. Ceiling sprinklers
                        hissed to life.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">In the chaos, Rachel tugged on my sleeve. “You have to get out of here!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was right. The school was in flames and I’d be held responsible. Mortals
                        couldn’t see
                        through the Mist properly. To them it would look like I’d just attacked a helpless cheerleader
                        in front of a
                        group of witnesses. There was no way I could explain it. I turned from Paul and sprinted for the
                        broken band
                        room window. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I burst out of the alley onto East 81st and ran straight into Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, you’re out early!” She laughed, grabbing my shoulders to keep me from
                        tumbling into the
                        street. “Watch where you’re going, Seaweed Brain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a split second she was in a good mood and everything was fine. She was
                        wearing jeans and an
                        orange camp T-shirt and her clay bead necklace. Her blond hair was pulled back in a ponytail.
                        Her gray eyes
                        sparkled. She looked like she was ready to catch a movie, have a cool afternoon hanging out
                        together. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Then Rachel Elizabeth Dare, still covered in monster dust, came charging out of
                        the alley,
                        yelling, “Percy, wait up!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s smile melted. She stared at Rachel, then at the school. For the
                        first time, she
                        seemed to notice the black smoke and the ringing fire alarms. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She frowned at me. “What did you do this time? And who is this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Rachel—Annabeth. Annabeth—Rachel. Um, she’s a friend. I guess.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t sure what else to call Rachel. I mean, I barely knew her, but after
                        being in two
                        life-or-death situations together, I couldn’t just call her nobody. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi,” Rachel said. Then she turned to me. “You are in <i class="calibre5">so
                        </i>much trouble.
                        And you still owe me an explanation!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Police sirens wailed on FDR Drive. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Annabeth said coldly. “We should go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I want to know more about half-bloods,” Rachel insisted. “And monsters. And
                        this stuff about
                        the gods.” She grabbed my arm, whipped out a permanent marker, and wrote a phone number on my
                        hand. “You’re
                        going to call me and explain, okay? You owe me that. Now get going.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll make up some story,” Rachel said. “I’ll tell them it wasn’t your fault.
                        Just go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She ran back toward the school, leaving Annabeth and me in the street. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stared at me for a second. Then she turned and took off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” I jogged after her. “There were these two <i
                            class="calibre5">empou</i><i class="calibre5">sai</i>,” I tried to explain. “They were
                        cheerleaders, see, and they said camp was going to
                        burn, and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You told a mortal girl about half-bloods?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She can see through the Mist. She saw the monsters before I did.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So you told her the truth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She recognized me from Hoover Dam, so—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve met her <i class="calibre5">before</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um, last winter. But seriously, I barely know her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She’s kind of cute.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I never thought about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth kept walking toward York Avenue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll deal with the school,” I promised, anxious to change the subject.
                        “Honest, it’ll be
                        fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth wouldn’t even look at me. “I guess our afternoon is off. We should get
                        you out of
                        here, now that the police will be searching for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind us, smoke billowed up from Goode High School. In the dark column of
                        ashes, I thought I
                        could almost see a face—a she-demon with red eyes, laughing at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Your pretty little camp in flames</i>, Kelli had said. <i
                            class="calibre5">Your friends made slaves to the Lord of Time</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re right,” I told Annabeth, my heart sinking. “We have to get to Camp
                        Half-Blood. <i class="calibre5">Now</i>.” </p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to talk to Annabeth, but she was acting like I’d just punched her
                        grandmother. All I
                        managed to get out of her was that she’d had a monster-infested spring in San Francisco; she’d
                        come back to camp
                        twice since Christmas but wouldn’t tell me why (which kind of ticked me off, because she hadn’t
                        even told me she
                        was in New York); and she’d learned nothing about the whereabouts of Nico di Angelo (long
                        story). </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Any word on Luke?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She shook her head. I knew this was a touchy subject for her. Annabeth had
                        always admired Luke,
                        the former head counselor for Hermes who had betrayed us and joined the evil Titan Lord Kronos.
                        She wouldn’t
                        admit it, but I knew she still liked him. When we’d fought Luke on Mount Tamalpais last winter,
                        he’d somehow
                        survived a fifty-foot fall off a cliff. Now, as far as I knew, he was still sailing around on
                        his demon-infested
                        cruise ship while his chopped-up Lord Kronos re-formed, bit by bit, in a golden sarcophagus,
                        biding his time
                        until he had enough power to challenge the Olympian gods. In demigod-speak, we call this a
                        “problem.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mount Tam is still overrun with monsters,” Annabeth said. “I didn’t dare go
                        close, but I don’t
                        think Luke is up there. I think I would know if he was.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That didn’t make me feel much better. “What about Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s at camp,” she said. “We’ll see him today.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Did he have any luck? I mean, with the search for Pan?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth fingered her bead necklace, the way she does when she’s worried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ll see,” she said. But she didn’t explain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As we headed through Brooklyn, I used Annabeth’s phone to call my mom.

                        use cell phones if we can avoid it, because broadcasting our voices is like sending up a flare
                        to the monsters:
                        <i class="calibre5">Here I am! Please eat me now! </i>But I figured this call was important. I
                        left a message on
                        our home voice mail, trying to explain what had happened at Goode. I probably didn’t do a very
                        good job. I told
                        my mom I was fine, she shouldn’t worry, but I was going to stay at camp until things cooled
                        down. I asked her to
                        tell Paul Blofis I was sorry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We rode in silence after that. The city melted away until we were off the
                        expressway and
                        rolling through the countryside of northern Long Island, past orchards and wineries and fresh
                        produce stands.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the phone number Rachel Elizabeth Dare had scrawled on my hand. I
                        knew it was
                        crazy, but I was tempted to call her. Maybe she could help me understand what the <i
                            class="calibre5">empousa
                        </i>had been talking about—the camp burning, my friends imprisoned. And why had Kelli exploded
                        into flames? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew monsters never truly died. Eventually—maybe weeks, months, or years from
                        now—Kelli would
                        re-form out of the primordial nastiness seething in the Underworld. But still, monsters didn’t
                        usually let
                        themselves get destroyed so easily. If she really <i class="calibre5">was </i>destroyed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The taxi exited on Route 25A. We headed through the woods along the North Shore
                        until a low
                        ridge of hills appeared on our left. Annabeth told the driver to pull over on Farm Road 3.141,
                        at the base of
                        Half-Blood Hill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The driver frowned. “There ain’t nothing here, miss. You sure you want out?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, please.” Annabeth handed him a roll of mortal cash, and the driver
                        decided not to argue.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and I hiked to the crest of the hill. The young guardian dragon was
                        dozing, coiled
                        around the pine tree, but he lifted his coppery head as we approached and let Annabeth scratch
                        under his chin.
                        Steam hissed out his nostrils like from a teakettle, and he went cross-eyed with pleasure. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, Peleus,” Annabeth said. “Keeping everything safe?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The last time I’d seen the dragon he’d been six feet long. Now he was at least
                        twice that, and
                        as thick around as the tree itself. Above his head, on the lowest branch of the pine tree, the
                        Golden Fleece
                        shimmered, its magic protecting the camp’s borders from invasion. The dragon seemed relaxed,
                        like everything was
                        okay. Below us, Camp Half-Blood looked peaceful—green fields, forest, shiny white Greek
                        buildings. The
                        four-story farmhouse we called the Big House sat proudly in the midst of the strawberry fields.
                        To the north,
                        past the beach, the Long Island Sound glittered in the sunlight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Still…something felt wrong. There was tension in the air, as if the hill itself
                        were holding
                        its breath, waiting for something bad to happen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We walked down into the valley and found the summer session in full swing. Most
                        of the campers
                        had arrived last Friday, so I already felt out of it. The satyrs were playing their pipes in the
                        strawberry
                        fields, making the plants grow with woodland magic. Campers were having flying horseback
                        lessons, swooping over
                        the woods on their pegasi. Smoke rose from the forges, and hammers rang as kids made their own
                        weapons for Arts
                        &amp; Crafts. The Athena and Demeter teams were having a chariot race around the track, and over
                        at the canoe
                        lake some kids in a Greek trireme were fighting a large orange sea serpent. A typical day at
                        camp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I need to talk to Clarisse,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at her as if she’d just said <i class="calibre5">I need to eat a
                            large, smelly
                            boot</i>. “What for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse from the Ares cabin was one of my least favorite people. She was a
                        mean, ungrateful
                        bully. Her dad, the war god, wanted to kill me. She tried to beat me to a pulp on a regular
                        basis. Other than
                        that, she was just great. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ve been working on something,” Annabeth said. “I’ll see you later.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Working on what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth glanced toward the forest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll tell Chiron you’re here,” she said. “He’ll want to talk to you before the
                        hearing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What hearing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But she jogged down the path toward the archery field without looking back.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” I muttered. “Great talking with you, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"> </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">As I made my way through camp, I said hi to some of my friends. In the Big
                        House’s driveway,
                        Connor and Travis Stoll from the Hermes cabin were hot-wiring the camp’s SUV. Silena Beauregard,
                        the head
                        counselor for Aphrodite, waved at me from her pegasus as she flew past. I looked for Grover, but
                        I didn’t see
                        him. Finally I wandered into the sword arena, where I usually go when I’m in a bad mood.
                        Practicing always calms
                        me down. Maybe that’s because swordplay is one thing I actually understand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I walked into the amphitheater and my heart almost stopped. In the middle of
                        the arena floor,
                        with its back to me, was the biggest hellhound I’d ever seen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I mean, I’ve seen some pretty big hellhounds. One the size of a rhino tried to
                        kill me when I
                        was twelve. But <i class="calibre5">this </i>hellhound was bigger than a tank. I had no idea how
                        it had gotten
                        past the camp’s magic boundaries. It looked right at home, lying on its belly, growling
                        contentedly as it chewed
                        the head off a combat dummy. It hadn’t noticed me yet, but if I made a sound, I knew it would
                        sense me. There
                        was no time to go for help. I pulled out Riptide and uncapped it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yaaaaah!” I charged. I brought down the blade on the monster’s enormous
                        backside when out of
                        nowhere another sword blocked my strike. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">CLANG! </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The hellhound pricked up its ears. <i class="calibre5">“WOOF!” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I jumped back and instinctively struck at the swordsman— a gray-haired man in
                        Greek armor. He
                        parried my attack with no problem. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa there!” he said. “Truce!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">“WOOF!” </i>The hellhound’s bark shook the arena. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s a hellhound!” I shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She’s harmless,” the man said. “That’s Mrs. O’Leary.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked. “Mrs. O’Leary?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the sound of her name, the hellhound barked again. I realized she wasn’t
                        angry. She was
                        excited. She nudged the soggy, badly chewed target dummy toward the swordsman. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good girl,” the man said. With his free hand he grabbed the armored manikin by
                        the neck and
                        heaved it toward the bleachers. “Get the Greek! Get the Greek!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. O’Leary bounded after her prey and pounced on the dummy, flattening its
                        armor. She began
                        chewing on its helmet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The swordsman smiled dryly. He was in his fifties, I guess, with short gray
                        hair and a clipped
                        gray beard. He was in good shape for an older guy. He wore black mountain-climbing pants and a
                        bronze
                        breastplate strapped over an orange camp T-shirt. At the base of his neck was a strange mark, a
                        purplish blotch
                        like a birthmark or a tattoo, but before I could make out what it was, he shifted his armor
                        straps and the mark
                        disappeared under his collar. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mrs. O’Leary is my pet,” he explained. “I couldn’t let you stick a sword in
                        her rump, now,
                        could I? That might have scared her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who are you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Promise not to kill me if I put my sword away?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I guess.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He sheathed his sword and held out his hand. “Quintus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shook his hand. It was as rough as sandpaper. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy Jackson,” I said. “Sorry about—How did you, um—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Get a hellhound for a pet? Long story, involving many close calls with death
                        and quite a few
                        giant chew toys. I’m the new sword instructor, by the way. Helping out Chiron while Mr. D is
                        away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh.” I tried not to stare as Mrs. O’Leary ripped off the target dummy’s shield
                        with the arm
                        still attached and shook it like a Frisbee. “Wait, Mr. D is away?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, well…busy times. Even Dionysus must help out. He’s gone to visit some old
                        friends. Make
                        sure they’re on the right side. I probably shouldn’t say more than that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">If Dionysus was gone, that was the best news I’d had all day. He was only our
                        camp director
                        because Zeus had sent him here as a punishment for chasing some off-limits wood nymph. He hated
                        the campers and
                        tried to make our lives miserable. With him away, this summer might actually be cool. On the
                        other hand, if
                        Dionysus had gotten off his butt and actually started helping the gods recruit against the Titan
                        threat, things
                        must be looking pretty bad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Off to my left, there was a loud <i class="calibre5">BUMP</i>. Six wooden
                        crates the size of
                        picnic tables were stacked nearby, and they were rattling. Mrs. O’Leary cocked her head and
                        bounded toward them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa, girl!” Quintus said. “Those aren’t for you.” He distracted her with the
                        bronze shield
                        Frisbee. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The crates thumped and shook. There were words printed on the sides, but with
                        my dyslexia they
                        took me a few minutes to decipher: </p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="center">TRIPLE G RANCH <br class="calibre1" />
                        FRAGILE <br class="calibre1" />
                        THIS END UP</p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Along the bottom, in smaller letters: <small>OPEN WITH CARE. TRIPLE G RANCH IS
                            NOT
                            RESPONSIBLE FOR
                            PROPERTY DAMAGE, MAIMING, OR EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL DEATHS.</small> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s in the boxes?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A little surprise,” Quintus said. “Training activity for tomorrow night.
                        You’ll love it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh, okay,” I said, though I wasn’t sure about the “excruciatingly painful
                        death” part. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus threw the bronze shield, and Mrs. O’Leary lumbered after it. “You young
                        ones need more
                        challenges. They didn’t have camps like this when I was a boy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You—you’re a half-blood?” I didn’t mean to sound so surprised, but I’d never
                        seen an old
                        demigod before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus chuckled. “Some of us <i class="calibre5">do </i>survive into
                        adulthood, you know. Not
                        all of us are the subject of terrible prophecies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You know about my prophecy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve heard a few things.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to ask <i class="calibre5">what </i>few things, but just then Chiron
                        clip-clopped into
                        the arena. “Percy, there you are!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He must’ve just come from teaching archery. He had a quiver and bow slung over
                        his #1 CENTAUR
                        T-shirt. He’d trimmed his curly brown hair and beard for the summer, and his lower half, which
                        was a white
                        stallion, was flecked with mud and grass. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I see you’ve met our new instructor.” Chiron’s tone was light, but there was
                        an uneasy look in
                        his eyes. “Quintus, do you mind if I borrow Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not at all, Master Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No need to call me ‘Master,’” Chiron said, though he sounded sort of pleased.
                        “Come, Percy. We
                        have much to discuss.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took one more glance at Mrs. O’Leary, who was now chewing off the target
                        dummy’s legs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, see you,” I told Quintus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As we were walking away, I whispered to Chiron, “Quintus seems kind of—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mysterious?” Chiron suggested. “Hard to read?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron nodded. “A very qualified half-blood. Excellent swordsman. I just wish I
                        understood…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Whatever he was going to say, he apparently changed his mind. “First things
                        first, Percy.
                        Annabeth told me you met some <i class="calibre5">empousai</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” I told him about the fight at Goode, and how Kelli had exploded into
                        flames. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mm,” Chiron said. “The more powerful ones can do that. She did not die, Percy.
                        She simply
                        escaped. It is not good that the she-demons are stirring.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What were they doing there?” I asked. “Waiting for me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Possibly.” Chiron frowned. “It is amazing you survived. Their powers of
                        deception…almost any
                        male hero would’ve fallen under their spell and been devoured.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I would’ve been,” I admitted. “Except for Rachel.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron nodded. “Ironic to be saved by a mortal, yet we owe her a debt. What the
                        <i class="calibre5">empousa </i>said about an attack on camp—we must speak of this further. But
                        for now, come,
                        we should get to the woods. Grover will want you there.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“At his formal hearing,” Chiron said grimly. “The Council of Cloven Elders is
                        meeting now to
                        decide his fate.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron said we needed to hurry, so I let him give me a ride on his back. As we
                        galloped past
                        the cabins, I glanced at the dining hall—an open-air Greek pavilion on a hill overlooking the
                        sea. It was the
                        first time I’d seen the place since last summer, and it brought back bad memories. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron plunged into the woods. Nymphs peeked out of the trees to watch us pass.
                        Large shapes
                        rustled in the shadows—monsters that were stocked in here as a challenge to the campers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought I knew the forest pretty well after playing capture the flag here for
                        two summers,
                        but Chiron took me a way I didn’t recognize, through a tunnel of old willow trees, past a little
                        waterfall, and
                        into a glade blanketed with wildflowers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bunch of satyrs were sitting in a circle in the grass. Grover stood in the
                        middle, facing
                        three really old, really fat satyrs who sat on topiary thrones shaped out of rose bushes. I’d
                        never seen the
                        three old satyrs before, but I guessed they must be the Council of Cloven Elders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover seemed to be telling them a story. He twisted the bottom of his T-shirt,
                        shifting
                        nervously on his goat hooves. He hadn’t changed much since last winter, maybe because satyrs age
                        half as fast as
                        humans. His acne had flared up. His horns had gotten a little bigger so they just stuck out over
                        his curly hair.
                        I realized with a start that I was taller than he was now. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Standing off to one side of the circle were Annabeth, another girl I’d never
                        seen before, and
                        Clarisse. Chiron dropped me next to them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse’s stringy brown hair was tied back with a camouflage bandanna. If
                        possible, she looked
                        even buffer, like she’d been working out. She glared at me and muttered, “Punk,” which must’ve
                        meant she was in
                        a good mood. Usually she says hello by trying to kill me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth had her arm around the other girl, who looked like she’d been crying.
                        She was
                        small—petite, I guess you’d call it—with wispy hair the color of amber and a pretty, elfish
                        face. She wore a
                        green chiton and laced sandals, and she was dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief. “It’s going
                        terribly,” she
                        sniffled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, no.” Annabeth patted her shoulder. “He’ll be fine, Juniper.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth looked at me and mouthed the words <i class="calibre5">Grover’s
                            girlfriend</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At least I thought that’s what she said, but that made no sense. Grover with a
                        girlfriend? Then
                        I looked at Juniper more closely, and I realized her ears were slightly pointed. Her eyes,
                        instead of being red
                        from crying, were tinged green, the color of chlorophyll. She was a tree nymph—a dryad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Master Underwood!” the council member on the right shouted, cutting off
                        whatever Grover was
                        trying to say. “Do you seriously expect us to believe this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“B-but, Silenus,” Grover stammered. “It’s the truth!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Council guy, Silenus, turned to his colleagues and muttered something.
                        Chiron cantered up
                        to the front and stood next to them. I remembered he was an honorary member of the council, but
                        I’d never
                        thought about it much. The elders didn’t look very impressive. They reminded me of the goats in
                        a petting
                        zoo—huge bellies, sleepy expressions, and glazed eyes that couldn’t see past the next handful of
                        goat chow. I
                        wasn’t sure why Grover looked so nervous. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Silenus tugged his yellow polo shirt over his belly and adjusted himself on his
                        rosebush
                        throne. “Master Underwood, for six months—<i class="calibre5">six months</i>—we have been
                        hearing these
                        scandalous claims that you heard the wild god Pan speak.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But I did!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Impudence!” said the elder on the left. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now, Maron,” Chiron said. “Patience.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Patience, indeed!” Maron said. “I’ve had it up to my horns with this nonsense.
                        As if the wild
                        god would speak to…to <i class="calibre5">him</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper looked like she wanted to charge the old satyr and beat him up, but
                        Annabeth and
                        Clarisse held her back. “Wrong fight, girlie,” Clarisse muttered. “Wait.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I don’t know what surprised me more: Clarisse holding somebody back from a
                        fight, or the fact
                        that she and Annabeth, who despised each other, almost seemed like they were working together.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“For six months,” Silenus continued, “we have indulged you, Master Underwood.
                        We let you
                        travel. We allowed you to keep your searcher’s license. We waited for you to bring proof of your
                        preposterous
                        claim. And what have you found in six months of travel?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I just need more time,” Grover pleaded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nothing!” the elder in the middle chimed in. “You have found nothing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But, Leneus—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Silenus raised his hand. Chiron leaned in and said something to the satyrs. The
                        satyrs didn’t
                        look happy. They muttered and argued among themselves, but Chiron said something else, and
                        Silenus sighed. He
                        nodded reluctantly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Master Underwood,” Silenus announced, “we will give you one more chance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover brightened. “Thank you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“One more week.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What? But, sir! That’s impossible!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“One more week, Master Underwood. And then, if you cannot prove your claims, it
                        will be time
                        for you to pursue another career. Something to suit your dramatic talents. Puppet theater,
                        perhaps. Or tap
                        dancing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But, sir, I—I can’t lose my searcher’s license. My whole life—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This meeting of the council is adjourned,” Silenus said. “And now let us enjoy
                        our noonday
                        meal!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old satyr clapped his hands, and a bunch of nymphs melted out of the trees
                        with platters of
                        vegetables, fruits, tin cans, and other goat delicacies. The circle of satyrs broke and charged
                        the food. Grover
                        walked dejectedly toward us. His faded blue T-shirt had a picture of a satyr on it. It read GOT
                        HOOVES? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi, Percy,” he said, so depressed he didn’t even offer to shake my hand. “That
                        went well,
                        huh?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Those old goats!” Juniper said. “Oh, Grover, they don’t know how hard you’ve
                        tried!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There is another option,” Clarisse said darkly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. No.” Juniper shook her head. “Grover, I won’t let you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His face was ashen. “I—I’ll have to think about it. But we don’t even know
                        where to look.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What are you talking about?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the distance, a conch horn sounded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth pursed her lips. “I’ll fill you in later, Percy. We’d better get back
                        to our cabins.
                        Inspection is starting.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">It didn’t seem fair that I’d have to do cabin inspection when I just got to
                        camp, but that’s
                        the way it worked. Every afternoon, one of the senior counselors came around with a papyrus
                        scroll checklist.
                        Best cabin got first shower hour, which meant hot water guaranteed. Worst cabin got kitchen
                        patrol after dinner.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The problem for me: I was usually the only one in the Poseidon cabin, and I’m
                        not exactly what
                        you would call neat. The cleaning harpies only came through on the last day of summer, so my
                        cabin was probably
                        just the way I’d left it on winter break: my candy wrappers and chip bags still on my bunk, my
                        armor for capture
                        the flag lying in pieces all around the cabin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I raced toward the commons area, where the twelve cabins—one for each Olympian
                        god—made a U
                        around the central green. The Demeter kids were sweeping out theirs and making fresh flowers
                        grow in their
                        window boxes. Just by snapping their fingers they could make honeysuckle vines bloom over their
                        doorway and
                        daisies cover their roof, which was totally unfair. I don’t think they ever got last place in
                        inspection. The
                        guys in the Hermes cabin were scrambling around in a panic, stashing dirty laundry under their
                        beds and accusing
                        each other of taking stuff. They were slobs, but they still had a head start on me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Over at the Aphrodite cabin, Silena Beauregard was just coming out, checking
                        items off the
                        inspection scroll. I cursed under my breath. Silena was nice, but she was an absolute neat
                        freak, the worst
                        inspector. She liked things to be pretty. I didn’t do “pretty.” I could almost feel my arms
                        getting heavy from
                        all the dishes I would have to scrub tonight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Poseidon cabin was at the end of the row of “male god” cabins on the right
                        side of the
                        green. It was made of gray shell-encrusted sea rock, long and low like a bunker, but it had
                        windows that faced
                        the sea and it always had a good breeze blowing through it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I dashed inside, wondering if maybe I could do a quick under-the-bed cleaning
                        job like the
                        Hermes guys, and I found my half-brother Tyson sweeping the floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” he bellowed. He dropped his broom and ran at me. If you’ve never been
                        charged by an
                        enthusiastic Cyclops wearing a flowered apron and rubber cleaning gloves, I’m telling you, it’ll
                        wake you up
                        quick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, big guy!” I said. “Ow, watch the ribs. The ribs.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed to survive his bear hug. He put me down, grinning like crazy, his
                        single calf-brown
                        eye full of excitement. His teeth were as yellow and crooked as ever, and his hair was a rat’s
                        nest. He wore
                        ragged XXXL jeans and a tattered flannel shirt under his flowered apron, but he was still a
                        sight for sore eyes.
                        I hadn’t seen him in almost a year, since he’d gone under the sea to work at the Cyclopes’
                        forges. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You are okay?” he asked. “Not eaten by monsters?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not even a little bit.” I showed him that I still had both arms and both legs,
                        and Tyson
                        clapped happily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yay!” he said. “Now we can eat peanut butter sandwiches and ride fish ponies!
                        We can fight
                        monsters and see Annabeth and make things go BOOM!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hoped he didn’t mean all at the same time, but I told him absolutely, we’d
                        have a lot of fun
                        this summer. I couldn’t help smiling, he was so enthusiastic about everything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But first,” I said, “we’ve gotta worry about inspection. We should…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I looked around and realized Tyson had been busy. The floor was swept. The
                        bunk beds were
                        made. The saltwater fountain in the corner had been freshly scrubbed so the coral gleamed. On
                        the windowsills,
                        Tyson had set out water-filled vases with sea anemones and strange glowing plants from the
                        bottom of the ocean,
                        more beautiful than any flower bouquets the Demeter kids could whip up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tyson, the cabin looks…amazing!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He beamed. “See the fish ponies? I put them on the ceiling!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A herd of miniature bronze hippocampi hung on wires from the ceiling, so it
                        looked like they
                        were swimming through the air. I couldn’t believe Tyson, with his huge hands, could make things
                        so delicate.
                        Then I looked over at my bunk, and I saw my old shield hanging on the wall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You fixed it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The shield had been badly damaged in a manticore attack last winter, but now it
                        was perfect
                        again—not a scratch. All the bronze pictures of my adventures with Tyson and Annabeth in the Sea
                        of Monsters
                        were polished and gleaming. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at Tyson. I didn’t know how to thank him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then somebody behind me said, “Oh, my.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Silena Beauregard was standing in the doorway with her inspection scroll. She
                        stepped into the
                        cabin, did a quick twirl, then raised her eyebrows at me. “Well, I had my doubts. But you clean
                        up nicely,
                        Percy. I’ll remember that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She winked at me and left the room. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson and I spent the afternoon catching up and just hanging out, which was
                        nice after a
                        morning of getting attacked by demon cheerleaders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We went down to the forge and helped Beckendorf from the Hephaestus cabin with
                        his
                        metalworking. Tyson showed us how he’d learned to craft magic weapons. He fashioned a flaming
                        double-bladed war
                        axe so fast even Beckendorf was impressed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">While he worked, Tyson told us about his year under the sea. His eye lit up
                        when he described
                        the Cyclopes’ forges and the palace of Poseidon, but he also told us how tense things were. The
                        old gods of the
                        sea, who’d ruled during Titan times, were starting to make war on our father. When Tyson had
                        left, battles had
                        been raging all over the Atlantic. Hearing that made me feel anxious, like I should be helping
                        out, but Tyson
                        assured me that Dad wanted us both at camp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Lots of bad people above the sea, too,” Tyson said. “We can make them go
                        boom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After the forges, we spent some time at the canoe lake with Annabeth. She was
                        really glad to
                        see Tyson, but I could tell she was distracted. She kept looking over at the forest, like she
                        was thinking about
                        Grover’s problem with the council. I couldn’t blame her. Grover was nowhere to be seen, and I
                        felt really bad
                        for him. Finding the lost god Pan had been his lifelong goal. His father and his uncle had both
                        disappeared
                        following the same dream. Last winter, Grover had heard a voice in his head: <i
                            class="calibre5">I await
                            you</i>—a voice he was sure belonged to Pan—but apparently his search had led nowhere. If
                        the council took
                        away his searcher’s license now, it would crush him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s this ‘other way’?” I asked Annabeth. “The thing Clarisse mentioned?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She picked up a stone and skipped it across the lake. “Something Clarisse
                        scouted out. I helped
                        her a little this spring. But it would be dangerous. Especially for Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Goat boy scares me,” Tyson murmured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at him. Tyson had faced down fire-breathing bulls and sea monsters and
                        cannibal
                        giants. “Why would you be scared of Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hooves and horns,” Tyson muttered nervously. “And goat fur makes my nose
                        itchy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And that pretty much ended our Grover conversation. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Before dinner, Tyson and I went down to the sword arena. Quintus was glad to
                        have company. He
                        still wouldn’t tell me what was in the wooden crates, but he did teach me a few sword moves. The
                        guy was good.
                        He fought the way some people play chess—like he was putting all the moves together and you
                        couldn’t see the
                        pattern until he made the last stroke and won with a sword at your throat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good try,” he told me. “But your guard is too low.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He lunged and I blocked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Have you always been a swordsman?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He parried my overhead cut. “I’ve been many things.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He jabbed and I sidestepped. His shoulder strap slipped down, and I saw that
                        mark on his
                        neck—the purple blotch. But it wasn’t a random mark. It had a definite shape—a bird with folded
                        wings, like a
                        quail or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s that on your neck?” I asked, which was probably a rude question, but
                        you can blame my
                        ADHD. I tend to just blurt things out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus lost his rhythm. I hit his sword hilt and knocked the blade out of his
                        hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He rubbed his fingers. Then he shifted his armor to hide the mark. It wasn’t a
                        tattoo, I
                        realized. It was an old burn…like he’d been branded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A reminder.” He picked up his sword and forced a smile. “Now, shall we go
                        again?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pressed me hard, not giving me time for any more questions. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">While he and I fought, Tyson played with Mrs. O’Leary, who he called the
                        “little doggie.” They
                        had a great time wrestling for the bronze shield and playing Get the Greek. By sunset, Quintus
                        hadn’t even
                        broken a sweat, which seemed kind of strange; but Tyson and I were hot and sticky, so we hit the
                        showers and got
                        ready for dinner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was feeling good. It was almost like a normal day at camp. Then dinner came,
                        and all the
                        campers lined up by cabin and marched into the dining pavilion. Most of them ignored the sealed
                        fissure in the
                        marble floor at the entrance—a ten-foot-long jagged scar that hadn’t been there last summer—but
                        I was careful to
                        step over it. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-9.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Big crack,” Tyson said when we were at our table. “Earthquake, maybe?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I said. “Not an earthquake.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t sure I should tell him. It was a secret only Annabeth and Grover and I
                        knew. But
                        looking in Tyson’s big eye, I knew I couldn’t hide anything from him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nico di Angelo,” I said, lowering my voice. “He’s this half-blood kid we
                        brought to camp last
                        winter. He, uh…he asked me to guard his sister on a quest, and I failed. She died. Now he blames
                        me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson frowned. “So he put a crack in the floor?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“These skeletons attacked us,” I said. “Nico told them to go away, and the
                        ground just opened
                        up and swallowed them. Nico…” I looked around to make sure no one was listening. “Nico is a son
                        of Hades.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson nodded thoughtfully. “The god of dead people.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So the Nico boy is gone now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I guess. I tried to search for him this spring. So did Annabeth. But we
                        didn’t have any
                        luck. This is secret, Tyson. Okay? If anyone found out he was a son of Hades, he would be in
                        danger. You can’t
                        even tell Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The bad prophecy,” Tyson said. “Titans might use him if they knew.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at him. Sometimes it was easy to forget that as big and childlike as
                        he was, Tyson was
                        pretty smart. He knew that the next child of the Big Three gods—Zeus, Poseidon, or Hades—who
                        turned sixteen was
                        prophesied to either save or destroy Mount Olympus. Most people assumed that meant me, but if I
                        died before I
                        turned sixteen, the prophecy could just as easily apply to Nico. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Exactly,” I said. “So—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mouth sealed,” Tyson promised. “Like the crack in the ground.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I had trouble falling asleep that night. I lay in bed listening to the waves on
                        the beach, and
                        the owls and monsters in the woods. I was afraid once I drifted off I’d have nightmares. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">See, for half-bloods, dreams are hardly ever just dreams. We get messages. We
                        glimpse things
                        that are happening to our friends or enemies. Sometimes we even glimpse the past or the future.
                        And at camp, my
                        dreams were always more frequent and vivid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">So I was still awake around midnight, staring at the bunk bed mattress above
                        me, when I
                        realized there was a strange light in the room. The saltwater fountain was glowing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I threw off the covers and walked cautiously toward it. Steam rose from the hot
                        salt water.
                        Rainbow colors shimmered through it, though there was no light in the room except for the moon
                        outside. Then a
                        pleasant female voice spoke from the steam: <i class="calibre5">Please deposit one drachma</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked over at Tyson, but he was still snoring. He sleeps about as heavily as
                        a tranquilized
                        elephant. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what to think. I’d never gotten a collect Iris-message before.
                        One golden drachma
                        gleamed at the bottom of the fountain. I scooped it up and tossed it through the mist. The coin
                        vanished. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“O, Iris, Goddess of the Rainbow,” I whispered. “Show me…Uh, whatever you need
                        to show me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The mist shimmered. I saw the dark shore of a river. Wisps of fog drifted
                        across black water.
                        The beach was strewn with jagged volcanic rock. A young boy squatted at the riverbank, tending a
                        campfire. The
                        flames burned an unnatural blue color. Then I saw the boy’s face. It was Nico di Angelo. He was
                        throwing pieces
                        of paper into the fire— Mythomagic trading cards, part of the game he’d been obsessed with last
                        winter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico was only ten, or maybe eleven by now, but he looked older. His hair had
                        grown longer. It
                        was shaggy and almost touched his shoulders. His eyes were dark. His olive skin had turned
                        paler. He wore ripped
                        black jeans and a battered aviator’s jacket that was several sizes too big, unzipped over a
                        black shirt. His
                        face was grimy, his eyes a little wild. He looked like a kid who’d been living on the streets.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-10.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I waited for him to look at me. No doubt he’d get crazy angry, start accusing
                        me of letting his
                        sister die. But he didn’t seem to notice me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stayed quiet, not daring to move. If he hadn’t sent this Iris-message, who
                        had? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico tossed another trading card into the blue flames. “Useless,” he muttered.
                        “I can’t believe
                        I ever liked this stuff.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A childish game, master,” another voice agreed. It seemed to come from near
                        the fire, but I
                        couldn’t see who was talking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico stared across the river. On the far shore was black beach shrouded in
                        haze. I recognized
                        it: the Underworld. Nico was camping at the edge of the River Styx. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve failed,” he muttered. “There’s no way to get her back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The other voice kept silent. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico turned toward it doubtfully. “Is there? Speak.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Something shimmered. I thought it was just firelight. Then I realized it was
                        the form of a
                        man—a wisp of blue smoke, a shadow. If you looked at him head-on, he wasn’t there. But if you
                        looked out of the
                        corner of your eye, you could make out his shape. A ghost. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It has never been done,” the ghost said. “But there may be a way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tell me,” Nico commanded. His eyes shined with a fierce light. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“An exchange,” the ghost said. “A soul for a soul.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve offered!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not yours,” the ghost said. “You cannot offer your father a soul he will
                        eventually collect
                        anyway. Nor will he be anxious for the death of his son. I mean a soul that should have died
                        already. Someone
                        who has cheated death.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico’s face darkened. “Not that again. You’re talking about murder.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m talking about justice,” the ghost said. “Vengeance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Those are not the same thing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The ghost laughed dryly. “You will learn differently as you get older.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-11.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico stared at the flames. “Why can’t I at least summon her? I want to talk to
                        her. She
                        would…she would help me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<i class="calibre5">I </i>will help you,” the ghost promised. “Have I not
                        saved you many
                        times? Did I not lead you through the maze and teach you to use your powers? Do you want revenge
                        for your sister
                        or not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t like the ghost’s tone of voice. He reminded me of a kid at my old
                        school, a bully who
                        used to convince other kids to do stupid things like steal lab equipment and vandalize the
                        teachers’ cars. The
                        bully never got in trouble himself, but he got tons of other kids suspended. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico turned from the fire so the ghost couldn’t see him, but I could. A tear
                        traced its way
                        down his face. “Very well. You have a plan?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, yes,” the ghost said, sounding quite pleased. “We have many dark roads to
                        travel. We must
                        start—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The image shimmered. Nico vanished. The woman’s voice from the mist said, <i
                            class="calibre5">Please deposit one drachma for another five minutes. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There were no other coins in the fountain. I grabbed for my pockets, but I was
                        wearing pajamas.
                        I lunged for the nightstand to check for spare change, but the Iris-message had already blinked
                        out, and the
                        room went dark again. The connection was broken. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stood in the middle of the cabin, listening to the gurgle of the saltwater
                        fountain and the
                        ocean waves outside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico was alive. He was trying to bring his sister back from the dead. And I had
                        a feeling I
                        knew what soul he wanted to exchange—someone who had cheated death. Vengeance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico di Angelo would come looking for me. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">The next morning there was a lot of excitement at breakfast. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Apparently around three in the morning an Aethiopian drakon had been spotted at
                        the borders of
                        camp. I was so exhausted I slept right through the noise. The magical boundaries had kept the
                        monster out, but
                        it prowled the hills, looking for weak spots in our defenses, and it didn’t seem anxious to go
                        away until Lee
                        Fletcher from Apollo’s cabin led a couple of his siblings in pursuit. After a few dozen arrows
                        lodged in the
                        chinks of the drakon’s armor, it got the message and withdrew. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s still out there,” Lee warned us during announcements. “Twenty arrows in
                        its hide, and we
                        just made it mad. The thing was thirty feet long and bright green. Its eyes—” He shuddered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You did well, Lee.” Chiron patted him on the shoulder. “Everyone stay alert,
                        but stay calm.
                        This has happened before.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Aye,” Quintus said from the head table. “And it will happen again. More and
                        more frequently.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The campers murmured among themselves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Everyone knew the rumors: Luke and his army of monsters were planning an
                        invasion of the camp.
                        Most of us expected it to happen this summer, but no one knew how or when. It didn’t help that
                        our attendance
                        was down. We only had about eighty campers. Three years ago, when I’d started, there had been
                        more than a
                        hundred. Some had died. Some had joined Luke. Some had just disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is a good reason for new war games,” Quintus continued, a glint in his
                        eyes. “We’ll see
                        how you all do with that tonight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes…” Chiron said. “Well, enough announcements. Let us bless this meal and
                        eat.” He raised his
                        goblet. “To the gods!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We all raised our glasses and repeated the blessing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson and I took our plates to the bronze brazier and scraped a portion of our
                        food into the
                        flames. I hoped the gods liked raisin toast and Fruit Loops. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Poseidon,” I said. Then I whispered, “Help me with Nico, and Luke, and
                        Grover’s problem…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was so much to worry about I could’ve stood there all morning, but I
                        headed back to my
                        table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Once everyone was eating, Chiron and Grover came over to visit. Grover was
                        bleary-eyed. His
                        shirt was inside out. He slid his plate onto the table and slumped next to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson shifted uncomfortably. “I will go…um…polish my fish ponies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He lumbered off, leaving his breakfast half eaten. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron tried for a smile. He probably wanted to look reassuring, but in centaur
                        form he towered
                        over me, casting a shadow across the table. “Well, Percy, how did you sleep?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh, fine.” I wondered why he asked that. Was it possible he knew something
                        about the weird
                        Iris-message I’d gotten? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I brought Grover over,” Chiron said, “because I thought you two might want to,
                        ah, discuss
                        matters. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some Iris-messages to send. I’ll see you later in the
                        day.” He gave
                        Grover a meaningful look, then trotted out of the pavilion. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s he talking about?” I asked Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover chewed his eggs. I could tell he was distracted, because he bit off the
                        tines of his
                        fork and chewed those down, too. “He wants you to convince me,” he mumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Somebody else slid next to me on the bench: Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll tell you what it’s about,” she said. “The Labyrinth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was hard to concentrate on what she was saying, because everybody in the
                        dining pavilion was
                        stealing glances at us and whispering. And Annabeth was right next to me. I mean <i
                            class="calibre5">right
                        </i>next to me. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re not supposed to be here,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We need to talk,” she insisted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But the rules…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She knew as well as I did that campers weren’t allowed to switch tables. Satyrs
                        were different.
                        They weren’t really demigods. But the half-bloods had to sit with their cabins. I wasn’t even
                        sure what the
                        punishment was for switching tables. I’d never seen it happen. If Mr. D had been here, he
                        probably would’ve
                        strangled Annabeth with magical grapevines or something, but Mr. D wasn’t here. Chiron had
                        already left the
                        pavilion. Quintus looked over and raised an eyebrow, but he didn’t say anything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look,” Annabeth said, “Grover is in trouble. There’s only one way we can
                        figure to help him.
                        It’s the Labyrinth. That’s what Clarisse and I have been investigating.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shifted my weight, trying to think clearly. “You mean the maze where they
                        kept the Minotaur,
                        back in the old days?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Exactly,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So…it’s not under the king’s palace in Crete anymore,” I guessed. “The
                        Labyrinth is under some
                        building in America.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">See? It only took me a few years to figure things out. I knew that important
                        places moved
                        around with Western Civilization, like Mount Olympus being over the Empire State Building, and
                        the Underworld
                        entrance being in Los Angeles. I was feeling pretty proud of myself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth rolled her eyes. “Under a building? Please, Percy. The Labyrinth is <i
                            class="calibre5">huge</i>. It wouldn’t fit under a single city, much less a single
                        building.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about my dream of Nico at the River Styx. “So…is the Labyrinth part
                        of the
                        Underworld?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No.” Annabeth frowned. “Well, there may be passages from the Labyrinth down <i
                            class="calibre5">into </i>the Underworld. I’m not sure. But the Underworld is way, way down.
                        The Labyrinth
                        is right under the surface of the mortal world, kind of like a second skin. It’s been growing
                        for thousands of
                        years, lacing its way under Western cities, connecting everything together underground. You can
                        get anywhere
                        through the Labyrinth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If you don’t get lost,” Grover muttered. “And die a horrible death.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover, there has to be a way,” Annabeth said. I got the feeling they’d had
                        this conversation
                        before. “Clarisse lived.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Barely!” Grover said. “And the other guy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He was driven insane. He didn’t die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, joy.” Grover’s lower lip quivered. “That makes me feel much better.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa,” I said. “Back up. What’s this about Clarisse and a crazy guy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth glanced over toward the Ares table. Clarisse was watching us like she
                        knew what we
                        were talking about, but then she fixed her eyes on her breakfast plate. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Last year,” Annabeth said, lowering her voice, “Clarisse went on a mission for
                        Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I remember,” I said. “It was secret.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth nodded. Despite how serious she was acting, I was happy she wasn’t mad
                        at me anymore.
                        And I kind of liked the fact that she’d broken the rules to come sit next to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It was secret,” Annabeth agreed, “because she found Chris Rodriguez.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The guy from the Hermes cabin?” I remembered him from two years ago. We’d
                        eavesdropped on
                        Chris Rodriguez aboard Luke’s ship, the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>. Chris was
                        one of the
                        half-bloods who’d abandoned camp and joined the Titan army. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” Annabeth said. “Last summer he just appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, near
                        Clarisse’s mom’s
                        house.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean he just appeared?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He was wandering around the desert, in a hundred and twenty degrees, in full
                        Greek armor,
                        babbling about string.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“String,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’d been driven completely insane. Clarisse brought him back to her mom’s
                        house so the
                        mortals wouldn’t institutionalize him. She tried to nurse him back to health. Chiron came out
                        and interviewed
                        him, but it wasn’t much good. The only thing they got out of him: Luke’s men have been exploring
                        the Labyrinth.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shivered, though I wasn’t sure exactly why. Poor Chris…he hadn’t been that
                        bad a guy. What
                        could’ve driven him mad? I looked at Grover, who was chewing up the rest of his fork. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay,” I asked. “Why were they exploring the Labyrinth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We weren’t sure,” Annabeth said. “That’s why Clarisse went on a scouting
                        expedition. Chiron
                        kept things hushed up because he didn’t want anyone panicking. He got me involved because…well,
                        the Labyrinth
                        has always been one of my favorite subjects. The architecture involved—” Her expression turned a
                        little dreamy.
                        “The builder, Daedalus, was a genius. But the point is, the Labyrinth has entrances everywhere.
                        If Luke could
                        figure out how to navigate it, he could move his army around with incredible speed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Except it’s a maze, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Full of horrible traps,” Grover agreed. “Dead ends. Illusions. Psychotic
                        goat-killing
                        monsters.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But not if you had Ariadne’s string,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“In the old days, Ariadne’s string guided Theseus out of the maze. It was a
                        navigation
                        instrument of some kind, invented by Daedalus. And Chris Rodriguez was mumbling about string.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So Luke is trying to find Ariadne’s string,” I said. “Why? What’s he
                        planning?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shook her head. “I don’t know. I thought maybe he wanted to invade
                        camp through the
                        maze, but that doesn’t make any sense. The closest entrances Clarisse found were in Manhattan,
                        which wouldn’t
                        help Luke get past our borders. Clarisse explored a little way into the tunnels, but…it was very
                        dangerous. She
                        had some close calls. I researched everything I could find about Daedalus. I’m afraid it didn’t
                        help much. I
                        don’t understand exactly what Luke’s planning, but I do know this: the Labyrinth might be the
                        key to Grover’s
                        problem.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked. “You think Pan is underground?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It would explain why he’s been impossible to find.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shuddered. “Satyrs hate going underground. No searcher would ever try
                        going in <i class="calibre5">that </i>place. No flowers. No sunshine. No coffee shops!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But,” Annabeth said, “the Labyrinth can lead you almost anywhere. It reads
                        your thoughts. It
                        was designed to fool you, to trick you and kill you; but if you can make the Labyrinth work <i
                            class="calibre5">for </i>you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It could lead you to the wild god,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I can’t do it.” Grover hugged his stomach. “Just thinking about it makes me
                        want to throw up
                        my silverware.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover, it may be your last chance,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The council is serious. <i class="calibre5">One </i>week or you learn to tap
                        dance!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Over at the head table, Quintus cleared his throat. I got the feeling he didn’t
                        want to make a
                        scene, but Annabeth was really pushing it, sitting at my table so long. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll talk later.” Annabeth squeezed my arm a little too hard. “Convince him,
                        will you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She returned to the Athena table, ignoring all the people who were staring at
                        her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover buried his head in his hands. “I can’t do it, Percy. My searcher’s
                        license. Pan. I’m
                        going to lose it all. I’ll have to start a puppet theater.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t say that! We’ll figure something out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked at me teary-eyed. “Percy, you’re my best friend. You’ve seen me
                        underground. In that
                        Cyclops’s cave. Do you really think I could…” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/3-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">His voice faltered. I remembered the Sea of Monsters, when he’d been stuck in a
                        Cyclops’s cave.
                        He’d never liked underground places to begin with, but now Grover really hated them. Cyclopes
                        gave him the
                        creeps, too. Even Tyson…Grover tried to hide it, but Grover and I could sort of read each
                        other’s emotions
                        because of this empathy link Grover had made between us. I knew how he felt. Grover was
                        terrified of the big
                        guy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have to leave,” Grover said miserably. “Juniper’s waiting for me. It’s a
                        good thing she
                        finds cowards attractive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After he was gone, I looked over at Quintus. He nodded gravely, like we were
                        sharing some dark
                        secret. Then he went back to cutting his sausage with a dagger. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">In the afternoon, I went down to the pegasus stables to visit my friend
                        Blackjack. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Yo, boss! </i>He capered around in his stall, his black

                    <p class="calibre14">“You know those aren’t good for you, Blackjack.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">I smiled and fed him a handful. Blackjack and I went back a long way. I sort of
                        helped rescue
                        him from Luke’s demon cruise ship a few years ago, and ever since, he insisted on repaying me
                        with favors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">So we got any quests coming up? </i>Blackjack asked. <i
                            class="calibre5">I’m ready to fly, boss! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I patted his nose. “Not sure, man. Everybody keeps talking about underground
                        mazes.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“You may be right, Blackjack. We’ll see.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Blackjack crunched down his sugar cubes. He shook his mane like he was having a
                        sugar seizure.
                        <i class="calibre5">Whoa! Good stuff! Well, boss, you come to your senses and want to fly
                            somewhere, just give a

                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told him I’d keep it in mind. Then a group of younger campers came into the
                        stables to start
                        their riding lessons, and I decided it was time to leave. I had a bad feeling I wasn’t going to
                        see Blackjack
                        for a long time. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">That night after dinner, Quintus had us suit up in combat armor like we were
                        getting ready for
                        capture the flag, but the mood among the campers was a lot more serious. Sometime during the day
                        the crates in
                        the arena had disappeared, and I had a feeling whatever was in them had been emptied into the
                        woods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Right,” Quintus said, standing on the head dining table. “Gather ’round.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was dressed in black leather and bronze. In the torchlight, his gray hair
                        made him look like
                        a ghost. Mrs. O’Leary bounded happily around him, foraging for dinner scraps. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“You will be in teams of two,” Quintus announced. When everybody started
                        talking and trying to
                        grab their friends, he yelled: “Which have already been chosen!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“AWWWWW!” everybody complained. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your goal is simple: collect the gold laurels without dying. The wreath is

                        holds the laurels. You must find the wreath before the other teams. And, of course…you will have
                        to slay the
                        monster to get it, and stay alive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The crowd started murmuring excitedly. The task sounded pretty straightforward.
                        Hey, we’d all
                        slain monsters before. That’s what we trained for. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I will now announce your partners,” Quintus said. “There will be no trading.
                        No switching. No
                        complaining.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">“Aroooof!” </i>Mrs. O’Leary buried her face in a plate of
                        pizza. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus produced a big scroll and started reading off names. Beckendorf would
                        be with Silena
                        Beauregard, which Beckendorf looked pretty happy about. The Stoll brothers, Travis and Connor,
                        would be
                        together. No surprise. They did everything together. Clarisse was with Lee Fletcher from the
                        Apollo cabin—melee
                        and ranged combat combined, they would be a tough combo to beat. Quintus kept rattling off the
                        names until he
                        said, “Percy Jackson with Annabeth Chase.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nice.” I grinned at Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your armor is crooked” was her only comment, and she redid my straps for me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover Underwood,” Quintus said, “with Tyson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover just about jumped out of his goat fur. “What? B-but—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, no,” Tyson whimpered. “Must be a mistake. Goat boy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No complaining!” Quintus ordered. “Get with your partner. You have two minutes
                        to prepare!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson and Grover both looked at me pleadingly. I tried to give them an
                        encouraging nod, and
                        gestured that they should move together. Tyson sneezed. Grover started chewing nervously on his
                        wooden club.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They’ll be fine,” Annabeth said. “Come on. Let’s worry about how we’re going
                        to stay alive.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">It was still light when we got into the woods, but the shadows from the trees
                        made it feel like
                        midnight. It was cold, too, even in summer. Annabeth and I found tracks almost
                        immediately—scuttling marks made
                        by something with a lot of legs. We began to follow the trail. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We jumped a creek and heard some twigs snapping nearby. We crouched behind a
                        boulder, but it
                        was only the Stoll brothers tripping through the woods and cursing. Their dad was the god of
                        thieves, but they
                        were about as stealthy as water buffaloes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Once the Stolls had passed, we forged deeper into the west woods where the
                        monsters were
                        wilder. We were standing on a ledge overlooking a marshy pond when Annabeth tensed. “This is
                        where we stopped
                        looking.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It took me a second to realize what she meant. Last winter, when we’d been
                        searching for Nico
                        di Angelo, this is where we’d given up hope of finding him. Grover, Annabeth, and I had stood on
                        this rock, and
                        I’d convinced them not to tell Chiron the truth: that Nico was a son of Hades. At the time it
                        seemed the right
                        thing to do. I wanted to protect his identity. I wanted to be the one to find him and make
                        things right for what
                        had happened to his sister. Now, six months later, I hadn’t even come close to finding him. It
                        left a bitter
                        taste in my mouth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I saw him last night,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth knit her eyebrows. “What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told her about the Iris-message. When I was done, she stared into the shadows
                        of the woods.
                        “He’s summoning the dead? That’s not good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The ghost was giving him bad advice,” I said. “Telling him to take revenge.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah…spirits are never good advisers. They’ve got their own agendas. Old
                        grudges. And they
                        resent the living.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s going to come after me,” I said. “The spirit mentioned a maze.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She nodded. “That settles it. We <i class="calibre5">have </i>to figure out the
                        Labyrinth.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe,” I said uncomfortably. “But who sent the Iris-message? If Nico didn’t
                        know I was
                        there—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A branch snapped in the woods. Dry leaves rustled. Something large was moving
                        in the trees,
                        just beyond the ridge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s not the Stoll brothers,” Annabeth whispered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Together we drew our swords. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We got to Zeus’s Fist, a huge pile of boulders in the middle of the west woods.
                        It was a
                        natural landmark where campers often rendezvoused on hunting expeditions, but now there was
                        nobody around. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Over there,” Annabeth whispered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, wait,” I said. “Behind us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was weird. Scuttling noises seemed to be coming from several different
                        directions. We were
                        circling the boulders, our swords drawn, when someone right behind us said, “Hi.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We whirled around, and the tree nymph Juniper yelped. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/3-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Put those down!” she protested. “Dryads don’t like sharp blades, okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Juniper,” Annabeth exhaled. “What are you doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I live here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I lowered my sword. “In the boulders?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pointed toward the edge of the clearing. “In the juniper. Duh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It made sense, and I felt kind of stupid. I’d been hanging around dryads for
                        years, but I never
                        really talked to them much. I knew they couldn’t go very far from their tree, which was their
                        source of life.
                        But I didn’t know much else. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are you guys busy?” Juniper asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well,” I said, “we’re in the middle of this game against a bunch of monsters
                        and we’re trying
                        not to die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re not busy,” Annabeth said. “What’s wrong, Juniper?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper sniffled. She wiped her silky sleeve under her eyes. “It’s Grover. He
                        seems so
                        distraught. All year he’s been out looking for Pan. And every time he comes back, it’s worse. I
                        thought maybe,
                        at first, he was seeing another tree.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” Annabeth said, as Juniper started crying. “I’m sure that’s not it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He had a crush on a blueberry bush once,” Juniper said miserably. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Juniper,” Annabeth said, “Grover would never even <i class="calibre5">look
                        </i>at another
                        tree. He’s just stressed out about his searcher’s license.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He can’t go underground!” she protested. “You can’t let him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth looked uncomfortable. “It might be the only way to help him; if we
                        just knew where to
                        start.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah.” Juniper wiped a green tear off her cheek. “About that…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Another rustle in the woods, and Juniper yelled, “Hide!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I could ask why, she went <i class="calibre5">poof </i>into green mist.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and I turned. Coming out of the woods was a glistening amber insect,
                        ten feet long,
                        with jagged pincers, an armored tail, and a stinger as long as my sword. A scorpion. Tied to its
                        back was a red
                        silk package. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“One of us gets behind it,” Annabeth said, as the thing clattered toward us.
                        “Cuts off its tail
                        while the other distracts it in front.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll take point,” I said. “You’ve got the invisibility hat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She nodded. We’d fought together so many times we knew each other’s moves. We
                        could do this,
                        easy. But it all went wrong when the other two scorpions appeared from the woods. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/3-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">“Three?” </i>Annabeth said. “That’s not possible! The whole
                        woods, and half
                        the monsters come at us?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I swallowed. One, we could take. Two, with a little luck. Three? Doubtful. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The scorpions scurried toward us, whipping their barbed tails like they’d come
                        here just to
                        kill us. Annabeth and I put our backs against the nearest boulder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Climb?” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No time,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was right. The scorpions were already surrounding us. They were so close I
                        could see their
                        hideous mouths foaming, anticipating a nice juicy meal of demigods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look out!” Annabeth parried away a stinger with the flat of her blade. I
                        stabbed with Riptide,
                        but the scorpion backed out of range. We clambered sideways along the boulders, but the
                        scorpions followed us. I
                        slashed at another one, but going on the offensive was too dangerous. If I went for the body,
                        the tail stabbed
                        downward. If I went for the tail, the thing’s pincers came from either side and tried to grab
                        me. All we could
                        do was defend, and we wouldn’t be able to keep that up for very long. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took another step sideways, and suddenly there was nothing behind me. It was
                        a crack between
                        two of the largest boulders, something I’d probably passed by a million times, but…</p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/3-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“In here,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth sliced at a scorpion then looked at me like I was crazy. “<i
                            class="calibre5">In
                            there? </i>It’s too narrow.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll cover you. Go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She ducked behind me and started squeezing between the two boulders. Then she
                        yelped and
                        grabbed my armor straps, and suddenly I was tumbling into a pit that hadn’t been there a moment
                        before. I could
                        see the scorpions above us, the purple evening sky and the trees, and then the hole shut like
                        the lens of a
                        camera, and we were in complete darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Our breathing echoed against stone. It was wet and cold. I was sitting on a
                        bumpy floor that
                        seemed to be made of bricks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I lifted Riptide. The faint glow of the blade was just enough to illuminate
                        Annabeth’s
                        frightened face and the mossy stone walls on either side of us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wh-where are we?” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Safe from scorpions, anyway.” I tried to sound calm, but I was freaking out.
                        The crack between
                        the boulders couldn’t have led into a cave. I would’ve known if there was a cave here; I was
                        sure of it. It was
                        like the ground had opened up and swallowed us. All I could think of was the fissure in the
                        dining room
                        pavilion, where those skeletons had been consumed last summer. I wondered if the same thing had
                        happened to us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I lifted my sword again for light. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s a long room,” I muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth gripped my arm. “It’s not a room. It’s a corridor.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was right. The darkness felt…emptier in front of us. There was a warm
                        breeze, like in
                        subway tunnels, only it felt older, more dangerous somehow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I started forward, but Annabeth stopped me. “Don’t take another step,” she
                        warned. “We need to
                        find the exit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She sounded really scared now. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s okay,” I promised. “It’s right—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked up and realized I couldn’t see where we’d fallen in. The ceiling was
                        solid stone. The
                        corridor seemed to stretch endlessly in both directions. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s hand slipped into mine. Under different circumstances I would’ve
                        been embarrassed,
                        but here in the dark I was glad to know where she was. It was about the only thing I was sure
                        of. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“Two steps back,” she advised. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We stepped backward together like we were in a minefield. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay,” she said. “Help me examine the walls.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The mark of Daedalus,” she said, as if that was supposed to make sense. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh, okay. What kind of—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Got it!” she said with relief. She set her hand on the wall and pressed
                        against a tiny
                        fissure, which began to glow blue. A Greek symbol appeared: Δ, the Ancient Greek Delta. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The roof slid open and we saw night sky, stars blazing. It was a lot darker
                        than it should’ve
                        been. Metal ladder rungs appeared in the side of the wall, leading up, and I could hear people
                        yelling our
                        names. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy! Annabeth!” Tyson’s voice bellowed the loudest, but others were calling
                        out too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked nervously at Annabeth. Then we began to climb. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We made our way around the rocks and ran into Clarisse and a bunch of other
                        campers carrying
                        torches. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where have you two been?” Clarisse demanded. “We’ve been looking forever.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But we were only gone a few minutes,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron trotted up, followed by Tyson and Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Tyson said. “You are okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re fine,” I said. “We fell in a hole.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The others looked at me skeptically, then at Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Honest!” I said. “There were three scorpions after us, so we ran and hid in
                        the rocks. But we
                        were only gone a minute.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve been missing for almost an hour,” Chiron said. “The game is over.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” Grover muttered. “We would’ve won, but a Cyclops sat on me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Was an accident!” Tyson protested, and then he sneezed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse was wearing the gold laurels, but she didn’t even brag about winning
                        them, which
                        wasn’t like her. “A hole?” she said suspiciously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth took a deep breath. She looked around at the other campers.
                        “Chiron…maybe we should
                        talk about this at the Big House.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse gasped. “You found it, didn’t you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth bit her lip. “I—Yeah. Yeah, we did.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bunch of campers started asking questions, looking about as confused as I
                        was, but Chiron
                        raised his hand for silence. “Tonight is not the right time, and this is not the right place.”
                        He stared at the
                        boulders as if he’d just noticed how dangerous they were. “All of you, back to your cabins. Get
                        some sleep. A
                        game well played, but curfew is past!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a lot of mumbling and complaints, but the campers drifted off,
                        talking among
                        themselves and giving me suspicious looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This explains a lot,” Clarisse said. “It explains what Luke is after.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait a second,” I said. “What do you mean? What did we find?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth turned toward me, her eyes dark with worry. “An entrance to the
                        Labyrinth. An invasion
                        route straight into the heart of the camp.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron had insisted we talk about it in the morning, which was kind of like, <i
                            class="calibre5">Hey, your life’s in mortal danger. Sleep tight! </i>It was hard to fall
                        asleep, but when I
                        finally did, I dreamed of a prison. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I saw a boy in a Greek tunic and sandals crouching alone in a massive stone
                        room. The ceiling
                        was open to the night sky, but the walls were twenty feet high and polished marble, completely
                        smooth. Scattered
                        around the room were wooden crates. Some were cracked and tipped over, as if they’d been flung
                        in there. Bronze
                        tools spilled out of one—a compass, a saw, and a bunch of other things I didn’t recognize. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The boy huddled in the corner, shivering from cold, or maybe fear. He was
                        spattered in mud. His
                        legs, arms, and face were scraped up as if he’d been dragged here along with the boxes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then the double oak doors moaned open. Two guards in bronze armor marched in,
                        holding an old
                        man between them. They flung him to the floor in a battered heap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Father!” The boy ran to him. The man’s robes were in tatters. His hair was
                        streaked with gray,
                        and his beard was long and curly. His nose had been broken. His lips were bloody. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The boy took the old man’s head in his arms. “What did they do to you?” Then he
                        yelled at the
                        guards, “I’ll kill you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There will be no killing today,” a voice said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The guards moved aside. Behind them stood a tall man in white robes. He wore a
                        thin circlet of
                        gold on his head. His beard was pointed like a spear blade. His eyes glittered cruelly. “You
                        helped the Athenian
                        kill my Minotaur, Daedalus. You turned my own daughter against me.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“You did that yourself, Your Majesty,” the old man croaked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A guard planted a kick in the old man’s ribs. He groaned in agony. The young
                        boy cried, “Stop!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You love your maze so much,” the king said, “I have decided to let you stay
                        here. This will be
                        your workshop. Make me new wonders. Amuse me. Every maze needs a monster. You shall be mine!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t fear you,” the old man groaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The king smiled coldly. He locked his eyes on the boy. “But a man cares about
                        his son, eh?
                        Displease me, old man, and the next time my guards inflict a punishment, it will be on him!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The king swept out of the room with his guards, and the doors slammed shut,
                        leaving the boy and
                        his father alone in the darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What will we do?” the boy moaned. “Father, they will kill you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old man swallowed with difficulty. He tried to smile, but it was a gruesome
                        sight with his
                        bloody mouth. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Take heart, my son.” He gazed up at the stars. “I—I will find a way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bar lowered across the doors with a fatal <i class="calibre5">BOOM</i>, and I
                        woke in a cold
                        sweat. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I was still feeling shaky the next morning when Chiron called a war council. We
                        met in the
                        sword arena, which I thought was pretty strange—trying to discuss the fate of the camp while
                        Mrs. O’Leary chewed
                        on a life-size squeaky pink rubber yak. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron and Quintus stood at the front by the weapon racks. Clarisse and
                        Annabeth sat next to
                        each other and led the briefing. Tyson and Grover sat as far away from each other as possible.
                        Also present
                        around the table: Juniper the tree nymph, Silena Beauregard, Travis and Connor Stoll,
                        Beckendorf, Lee Fletcher,
                        even Argus, our hundred-eyed security chief. That’s how I knew it was serious. Argus hardly ever
                        shows up unless
                        something really major is going on. The whole time Annabeth spoke, he kept his hundred blue eyes
                        trained on her
                        so hard his whole body turned bloodshot. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Luke must have known about the Labyrinth entrance,” Annabeth said. “He knew
                        everything about
                        camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought I heard a little pride in her voice, like she still respected the
                        guy, as evil as he
                        was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper cleared her throat. “That’s what I was trying to tell you last night.
                        The cave entrance
                        has been there a long time. Luke used to use it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Silena Beauregard frowned. “You knew about the Labyrinth entrance, and you
                        didn’t say
                        anything?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper’s face turned green. “I didn’t know it was important. Just a cave. I
                        don’t like yucky
                        old caves.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She has good taste,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I wouldn’t have paid any attention except…well, it was Luke.” She blushed a
                        little greener.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover huffed. “Forget what I said about good taste.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Interesting.” Quintus polished his sword as he spoke. “And you believe this
                        young man, Luke,
                        would dare use the Labyrinth as an invasion route?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Definitely,” Clarisse said. “If he could get an army of monsters inside Camp
                        Half-Blood, just
                        pop up in the middle of the woods without having to worry about our magical boundaries, we
                        wouldn’t stand a
                        chance. He could wipe us out easy. He must’ve been planning this for months.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s been sending scouts into the maze,” Annabeth said. “We know
                        because…because we found
                        one.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chris Rodriguez,” Chiron said. He gave Quintus a meaningful look. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah,” Quintus said. “The one in the…Yes. I understand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The one in the what?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse glared at me. “The point is, Luke has been looking for a way to
                        navigate the maze.
                        He’s searching for Daedalus’s workshop.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I remembered my dream the night before—the bloody old man in tattered robes.
                        “The guy who
                        created the maze.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes,” Annabeth said. “The greatest architect, the greatest inventor of all
                        time. If the
                        legends are true, his workshop is in the center of the Labyrinth. He’s the only one who knew how
                        to navigate the
                        maze perfectly. If Luke managed to find the workshop and convince Daedalus to help him, Luke
                        wouldn’t have to
                        fumble around searching for paths, or risk losing his army in the maze’s traps. He could
                        navigate anywhere he
                        wanted—quickly and safely. First to Camp Half-Blood to wipe us out. Then…to Olympus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The arena was silent except for Mrs. O’Leary’s toy yak getting disemboweled: <i
                            class="calibre5">SQUEAK! SQUEAK! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally Beckendorf put his huge hands on the table. “Back up a sec. Annabeth,
                        you said
                        ‘convince Daedalus’? Isn’t Daedalus dead?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus grunted. “I would hope so. He lived, what, three thousand years ago?
                        And even if he
                        were alive, don’t the old stories say he fled from the Labyrinth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron clopped restlessly on his hooves. “That’s the problem, my dear Quintus.
                        No one knows.
                        There are rumors…well, there are <i class="calibre5">many </i>disturbing rumors about Daedalus,
                        but one is that
                        he disappeared back into the Labyrinth toward the end of his life. He might still be down
                        there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about the old man I’d seen in my dream. He’d looked so frail, it was
                        hard to believe
                        he’d last another week, much less three thousand years. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We need to go in,” Annabeth announced. “We have to find the workshop before
                        Luke does. If
                        Daedalus is alive, we convince him to help us, not Luke. If Ariadne’s string still exists, we
                        make sure it never
                        falls into Luke’s hands.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait a second,” I said. “If we’re worried about an attack, why not just blow
                        up the entrance?
                        Seal the tunnel?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Great idea!” Grover said. “I’ll get the dynamite!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s not so easy, stupid,” Clarisse growled. “We tried that at the entrance we
                        found in
                        Phoenix. It didn’t go well.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth nodded. “The Labyrinth is magical architecture, Percy. It would take
                        huge power to
                        seal even one of its entrances. In Phoenix, Clarisse demolished a whole building with a wrecking
                        ball, and the
                        maze entrance just shifted a few feet. The best we can do is prevent Luke from learning to
                        navigate the
                        Labyrinth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We could fight,” Lee Fletcher said. “We know where the entrance is now. We can
                        set up a
                        defensive line and wait for them. If an army tries to come through, they’ll find us waiting with
                        our bows.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We will certainly set up defenses,” Chiron agreed. “But I fear Clarisse is
                        right. The magical
                        borders have kept this camp safe for hundreds of years. If Luke manages to get a large army of
                        monsters into the
                        center of camp, bypassing our boundaries…we may not have the strength to defeat them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody looked real happy about that news. Chiron usually tried to be upbeat and
                        optimistic. If
                        he was predicting we couldn’t hold off an attack, that wasn’t good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We have to get to Daedalus’s workshop first,” Annabeth insisted. “Find
                        Ariadne’s string and
                        prevent Luke from using it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But if nobody can navigate in there,” I said, “what chance do we have?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve been studying architecture for years,” she said. “I know Daedalus’s
                        Labyrinth better than
                        anybody.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“From reading about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s not enough.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It has to be!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It isn’t!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are you going to help me or not?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I realized everyone was watching Annabeth and me like a tennis match. Mrs.
                        O’Leary’s squeaky
                        yak went <i class="calibre5">EEK! </i>as she ripped off its pink rubber head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron cleared his throat. “First things first. We need a quest. Someone must
                        enter the
                        Labyrinth, find the workshop of Daedalus, and prevent Luke from using the maze to invade this
                        camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We all know who should lead this,” Clarisse said. “Annabeth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a murmur of agreement. I knew Annabeth had been waiting for her own
                        quest since she
                        was a little kid, but she looked uncomfortable. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve done as much as I have, Clarisse,” she said. “You should go, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse shook her head. “I’m not going back in there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Travis Stoll laughed. “Don’t tell me you’re scared. Clarisse, chicken?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse got to her feet. I thought she was going to pulverize Travis, but she
                        said in a shaky
                        voice: “You don’t understand anything, punk. I’m never going in there again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Never!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She stormed out of the arena. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Travis looked around sheepishly. “I didn’t mean to—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron raised his hand. “The poor girl has had a difficult year. Now, do we
                        have agreement that
                        Annabeth should lead the quest?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We all nodded except Quintus. He folded his arms and stared at the table, but I
                        wasn’t sure
                        anyone else noticed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Very well.” Chiron turned to Annabeth. “My dear, it’s your time to visit the
                        Oracle. Assuming
                        you return to us in one piece, we shall discuss what to do next.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Waiting for Annabeth was harder than visiting the Oracle myself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d heard it speak prophecies twice before. The first time had been in the
                        dusty attic of the
                        Big House, where the spirit of Delphi slept inside the body of a mummified hippie lady. The
                        second time, the
                        Oracle had come out for a little stroll in the woods. I still had nightmares about that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d never felt threatened by the Oracle’s presence, but I’d heard stories:
                        campers who’d gone
                        insane, or who’d seen visions so real they died of fear. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I paced the arena, waiting. Mrs. O’Leary ate her lunch, which consisted of a
                        hundred pounds of
                        ground beef and several dog biscuits the size of trash-can lids. I wondered where Quintus got
                        dog biscuits that
                        size. I didn’t figure you could just walk into Pet Zone and put those in your shopping cart.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron was deep in conversation with Quintus and Argus. It looked to me like
                        they were
                        disagreeing about something. Quintus kept shaking his head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">On the other side of the arena, Tyson and the Stoll brothers were racing
                        miniature bronze
                        chariots that Tyson had made out of armor scraps. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I gave up on pacing and left the arena. I stared across the fields at the Big
                        House’s attic
                        window, dark and still. What was taking Annabeth so long? I was pretty sure it hadn’t taken me
                        this long to get
                        my quest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” a girl whispered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper was standing in the bushes. It was weird how she almost turned
                        invisible when she was
                        surrounded by plants. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She gestured me over urgently. “You need to know: Luke wasn’t the only one I
                        saw around that
                        cave.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She glanced back at the arena. “I was trying to say something, but he was right
                        there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The sword master,” she said. “He was poking around the rocks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My stomach clenched. “Quintus? When?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know. I don’t pay attention to time. Maybe a week ago, when he first
                        showed up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What was he doing? Did he go in?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I’m not sure. He’s creepy, Percy. I didn’t even see him come into the glade.
                        Suddenly he was
                        just <i class="calibre5">there</i>. You have to tell Grover it’s too dangerous—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Juniper?” Grover called from inside the arena. “Where’d you go?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper sighed. “I’d better go in. Just remember what I said. Don’t trust that
                        man!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She ran into the arena. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the Big House, feeling more uneasy than ever. If Quintus was up to
                        something…I
                        needed Annabeth’s advice. She might know what to make of Juniper’s news. But where the heck was
                        she? Whatever
                        was happening with the Oracle, it shouldn’t be taking this long. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally I couldn’t stand it anymore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was against the rules, but then again, nobody was watching. I ran down the
                        hill and headed
                        across the fields. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The front parlor of the Big House was strangely quiet. I was used to seeing
                        Dionysus by the
                        fireplace, playing cards and eating grapes and griping at satyrs, but Mr. D was still away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I walked down the hallway, floorboards creaking under my feet. When I got to
                        the base of the
                        stairs, I hesitated. Four floors above would be a little trapdoor leading to the attic. Annabeth
                        would be up
                        there somewhere. I stood quietly and listened. But what I heard wasn’t what I had expected. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Sobbing. And it was coming from below me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I crept around the back of the stairs. The basement door was open. I didn’t
                        even know the Big
                        House <i class="calibre5">had </i>a basement. I peered inside and saw two figures in the far
                        corner, sitting
                        amid a bunch of stockpiled cases of ambrosia and strawberry preserves. One was Clarisse. The
                        other was a teenage
                        Hispanic guy in tattered camouflage pants and a dirty black T-shirt. His hair was greasy and
                        matted. He was
                        hugging his shoulders and sobbing. It was Chris Rodriguez, the half-blood who’d gone to work for
                        Luke. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s okay,” Clarisse was telling him. “Try a little more nectar.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re an illusion, Mary!” Chris backed farther into the corner. “G-get away.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My name’s not Mary.” Clarisse’s voice was gentle but really sad. I never knew
                        Clarisse could
                        sound that way. “My name is Clarisse. Remember. Please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s dark!” Chris yelled. “So dark!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come outside,” Clarisse coaxed. “The sunlight will help you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A…a thousand skulls. The earth keeps healing him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chris,” Clarisse pleaded. It sounded like she was close to tears. “You have to
                        get better.
                        Please. Mr. D will be back soon. He’s an expert in madness. Just hang on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chris’s eyes were like a cornered rat’s—wild and desperate. “There’s no way
                        out, Mary. No way
                        out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then he caught a glimpse of me and made a strangled, terrified sound. “The son
                        of Poseidon!
                        He’s horrible!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I backed away, hoping Clarisse hadn’t seen me. I listened for her to come
                        charging out and yell
                        at me, but instead she just kept talking to Chris in a sad pleading voice, trying to get him to
                        drink the
                        nectar. Maybe she thought it was part of Chris’s hallucination, but…<i class="calibre5">son of
                            Poseidon</i>?
                        Chris had been looking at me, and yet why did I get the feeling he hadn’t been talking about me
                        at all? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And Clarisse’s tenderness—it had never even occurred to me that she might like
                        someone; but the
                        way she said Chris’s name…She’d known him before he changed sides. She’d known him a lot better
                        than I realized.
                        And now he was shivering in a dark basement, afraid to come out, and mumbling about someone
                        named Mary. No
                        wonder Clarisse didn’t want anything to do with the Labyrinth. What had happened to Chris in
                        there? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I heard a creak from above—like the attic door opening— and I ran for the front
                        door. I needed
                        to get out of that house. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“My dear,” Chiron said. “You made it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth walked into the arena. She sat on a stone bench and stared at the
                        floor. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well?” Quintus asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth looked at me first. I couldn’t tell if she was trying to warn me, or
                        if the look in
                        her eyes was just plain fear. Then she focused on Quintus. “I got the prophecy. I will lead the
                        quest to find
                        Daedalus’s workshop.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody cheered. I mean, we all liked Annabeth, and we wanted her to have a
                        quest, but this one
                        seemed insanely dangerous. After what I’d seen of Chris Rodriguez, I didn’t even want to think
                        about Annabeth
                        descending into that weird maze again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron scraped a hoof on the dirt floor. “What did the prophecy say exactly, my
                        dear? The
                        wording is important.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth took a deep breath. “I, ah…well, it said, <i class="calibre5">You
                            shall delve in the
                            darkness of the endless maze</i>…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We waited. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i>“The dead, the traitor, and the lost one raise.”</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover perked up. “The lost one! That must mean Pan! That’s great!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“With the dead and the traitor,” I added. “Not so great.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And?” Chiron asked. “What is the rest?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">“You shall rise or fall by the ghost king’s hand,”
                        </i>Annabeth said, <i class="calibre5">“the child of Athena’s final stand.” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Everyone looked around uncomfortably. Annabeth was a daughter of Athena, and a
                        final stand
                        didn’t sound good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey…we shouldn’t jump to conclusions,” Silena said. “Annabeth isn’t the only
                        child of Athena,
                        right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But who’s this ghost king?” Beckendorf asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No one answered. I thought about the Iris-message I’d seen of Nico summoning
                        spirits. I had a
                        bad feeling the prophecy was connected to that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are there more lines?” Chiron asked. “The prophecy does not sound complete.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth hesitated. “I don’t remember exactly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron raised an eyebrow. Annabeth was known for her memory. She never forgot
                        something she
                        heard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shifted on her bench. “Something about…<i class="calibre5">Destroy
                            with a hero’s final
                            breath</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And?” Chiron asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She stood. “Look, the point is, I have to go in. I’ll find the workshop and
                        stop Luke. And…I
                        need help.” She turned to me. “Will you come?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t even hesitate. “I’m in.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She smiled for the first time in days, and that made it all worthwhile.
                        “Grover, you too? The
                        wild god is waiting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover seemed to forget how much he hated the underground. The line about the
                        “lost one” had
                        completely energized him. “I’ll pack extra recyclables for snacks!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And Tyson,” Annabeth said. “I’ll need you too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yay! Blow-things-up time!” Tyson clapped so hard he woke up Mrs. O’Leary, who
                        was dozing in
                        the corner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait, Annabeth,” Chiron said. “This goes against the ancient laws. A hero is
                        allowed only two
                        companions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I need them all,” she insisted. “Chiron, it’s important.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know why she was so certain, but I was happy she’d included Tyson. I
                        couldn’t imagine
                        leaving him behind. He was huge and strong and great at figuring out mechanical things. Unlike
                        satyrs, Cyclopes
                        had no problem underground. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Annabeth.” Chiron flicked his tail nervously. “Consider well. You would be
                        breaking the
                        ancient laws, and there are always consequences. Last winter, five went on a quest to save
                        Artemis. Only three
                        came back. Think on that. Three is a sacred number. There are three Fates, three Furies, three
                        Olympian sons of
                        Kronos. It is a good strong number that stands against many dangers. Four…this is risky.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth took a deep breath. “I know. But we have to. Please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could tell Chiron didn’t like it. Quintus was studying us, like he was trying
                        to decide which
                        of us would come back alive. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron sighed. “Very well. Let us adjourn. The members of the quest must
                        prepare themselves.
                        Tomorrow at dawn, we send you into the Labyrinth.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus pulled me aside as the council was breaking up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have a bad feeling about this,” he told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. O’Leary came over, wagging her tail happily. She dropped her shield at my
                        feet, and I
                        threw it for her. Quintus watched her romp after it. I remembered what Juniper had said about
                        him scouting out
                        the maze. I didn’t trust him, but when he looked at me, I saw real concern in his eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t like the idea of you going down there,” he said. “Any of you. But if
                        you must, I want
                        you to remember something. The Labyrinth exists to fool you. It will distract you. That’s
                        dangerous for
                        half-bloods. We are easily distracted.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve been in there?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Long ago.” His voice was ragged. “I barely escaped with my life. Most who
                        enter aren’t that
                        lucky.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gripped my shoulder. “Percy, keep your mind on what matters most. If you can
                        do that, you
                        might find the way. And here, I wanted to give you something.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">He handed me a little silver tube. It was so cold I almost dropped it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A whistle?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A dog whistle,” Quintus said. “For Mrs. O’Leary.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um, thanks, but—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How will it work in the maze? I’m not a hundred percent certain it will. But
                        Mrs. O’Leary is a
                        hellhound. She can appear when called, no matter how far away she is. I’d feel better knowing
                        you had this. If
                        you really need help, use it; but be careful, the whistle is made of Stygian ice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<i class="calibre5">What </i>ice?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“From the River Styx. Very hard to craft. Very delicate. It cannot melt, but it
                        will shatter
                        when you blow it, so you can only use it once.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about Luke, my old enemy. Right before I’d gone on my first quest,
                        Luke had given me
                        a gift, too— magic shoes that had been designed to drag me to my death. Quintus seemed so nice.
                        So concerned.
                        And Mrs. O’Leary liked him, which had to count for something. She dropped the slimy shield at my
                        feet and barked
                        excitedly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt ashamed that I could even think about mistrusting Quintus. But then
                        again, I’d trusted
                        Luke once. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thanks,” I told Quintus. I slipped the freezing whistle into my pocket,
                        promising myself that
                        I would never use it, and I dashed off to find Annabeth. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">As long as I’d been at camp, I’d never been inside the Athena cabin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was a silvery building, nothing fancy, with plain white curtains and a
                        carved stone owl over
                        the doorway. The owl’s onyx eyes seemed to follow me as I walked closer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hello?” I called inside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody answered. I stepped in and caught my breath. The place was a workshop
                        for brainiac kids.
                        The bunks were all pushed against one wall as if sleeping didn’t matter very much. Most of the
                        room was filled
                        with workbenches and tables and sets of tools and weapons. The back of the room was a huge
                        library crammed with
                        old scrolls and leather-bound books and paperbacks. There was an architect’s drafting table with
                        a bunch of
                        rulers and protractors, and some 3-D models of buildings. Huge old war maps were plastered to
                        the ceiling. Sets
                        of armor hung under the windows, their bronze plates glinting in the sun. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stood in the back of the room, rifling through old scrolls. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Knock, knock?” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She turned with a start. “Oh…hi. Didn’t hear you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She frowned at the scroll in her hands. “Just trying to do some research.
                        Daedalus’s Labyrinth
                        is so huge. None of the stories agree about anything. The maps just lead from nowhere to
                        nowhere.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about what Quintus had said, how the maze tries to distract you. I
                        wondered if
                        Annabeth knew that already. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll figure it out,” I promised. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her hair had come loose and was hanging in a tangled blond curtain all around
                        her face. Her
                        gray eyes looked almost black. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve wanted to lead a quest since I was seven,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re going to do awesome.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked at me gratefully, but then stared down at all the books and scrolls
                        she’d pulled
                        from the shelves. “I’m worried, Percy. Maybe I shouldn’t have asked you to do this. Or Tyson and
                        Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, we’re your friends. We wouldn’t miss it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But…” She stopped herself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What is it?” I asked. “The prophecy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sure it’s fine,” she said in a small voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What was the last line?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she did something that really surprised me. She blinked back tears and put
                        out her arms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stepped forward and hugged her. Butterflies started turning my stomach into a
                        mosh pit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, it’s…it’s okay.” I patted her back. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I was aware of everything in the room. I felt like I could read the tiniest
                        print on any book
                        on the shelves. Annabeth’s hair smelled like lemon soap. She was shivering. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chiron might be right,” she muttered. “I’m breaking the rules. But I don’t
                        know what else to
                        do. I need you three. It just feels right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then don’t worry about it,” I managed. “We’ve had plenty of problems before,
                        and we solved
                        them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is different. I don’t want anything happening to…any of you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind me, somebody cleared his throat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was one of Annabeth’s half-brothers, Malcolm. His face was bright red. “Um,
                        sorry,” he said.
                        “Archery practice is starting, Annabeth. Chiron said to come find you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stepped away from Annabeth. “We were just looking at maps,” I said stupidly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Malcolm stared at me. “Okay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tell Chiron I’ll be right there,” Annabeth said, and Malcolm left in a hurry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth rubbed her eyes. “You go ahead, Percy. I’d better get ready for
                        archery.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded, feeling more confused than I ever had in my life. I wanted to run
                        from the cabin…but
                        then again I didn’t. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Annabeth?” I said. “About your prophecy. The line about a hero’s last breath—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re wondering which hero? I don’t know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. Something else. I was thinking the last line usually rhymes with the one
                        before it. Was it
                        something about—did it end in the word <i class="calibre5">death</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stared down at her scrolls. “You’d better go, Percy. Get ready for the
                        quest.
                        I’ll—I’ll see you in the morning.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I left her there, staring at maps that led from nowhere to nowhere; but I
                        couldn’t shake the
                        feeling that one of us wasn’t going to come back from this quest alive. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">At least I got a good night’s sleep before the quest, right? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That night in my dreams, I was in the stateroom of the <i
                            class="calibre5">Princess
                            Andromeda</i>. The windows were open on a moonlit sea. Cold wind rustled the velvet drapes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke knelt on a Persian rug in front of the golden sarcophagus of Kronos. In
                        the moonlight,
                        Luke’s blond hair looked pure white. He wore an ancient Greek <i class="calibre5">chiton </i>and
                        a white <i class="calibre5">himation</i>, a kind of cape that flowed down his shoulders. The
                        white clothes made him
                        look timeless and a little unreal, like one of the minor gods on Mount Olympus. The last time
                        I’d seen him, he’d
                        been broken and unconscious after a nasty fall from Mount Tam. Now he looked perfectly fine.
                        Almost <i class="calibre5">too </i>healthy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Our spies report success, my lord,” he said. “Camp Half-Blood is sending a
                        quest, as you
                        predicted. Our side of the bargain is almost complete.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Excellent</i>. The voice of Kronos didn’t so much speak as
                        pierce my mind
                        like a dagger. It was freezing with cruelty. <i class="calibre5">Once we have the means to
                            navigate, I will lead
                            the vanguard through myself. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke closed his eyes as if collecting his thoughts. “My lord, perhaps it is too
                        soon. Perhaps
                        Krios or Hyperion should lead—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">No. </i>The voice was quiet but absolutely firm. <i
                            class="calibre5">I will
                            lead. One more heart shall join our cause, and that will be sufficient. At last I shall rise
                            fully from
                            Tartarus. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But the form, my lord…” Luke’s voice started shaking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i>Show me your sword, Luke Castellan.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A jolt went through me. I realized I’d never heard Luke’s last name before. It
                        had never even
                        occurred to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke drew his sword. Backbiter’s double edge glowed wickedly—half steel, half
                        celestial bronze.
                        I’d almost been killed several times by that sword. It was an evil weapon, able to kill both
                        mortals and
                        monsters. It was the only blade I really feared. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">You pledged yourself to me</i>, Kronos reminded him. <i
                            class="calibre5">You took this sword as proof of your oath. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, my lord. It’s just—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i>You wanted power. I gave you that. You are now beyond harm. Soon you will
                            rule
                            the world of
                            gods and mortals. Do you not wish to avenge yourself? To see Olympus destroyed?</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A shiver ran through Luke’s body. “Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The coffin glowed, golden light filling the room. <i class="calibre5">Then make
                            ready the
                            strike force. As soon as the bargain is done, we shall move forward. First, Camp Half-Blood
                            will be reduced
                            to ashes. Once those bothersome heroes are eliminated, we will march on Olympus. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a knock on the stateroom doors. The light of the coffin faded. Luke
                        rose. He sheathed
                        his sword, adjusted his white clothes, and took a deep breath. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come in.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The doors opened. Two <i class="calibre5">dracaenae </i>slithered in—snake
                        women with double
                        serpent trunks instead of legs. Between them walked Kelli, the <i class="calibre5">empousa
                        </i>cheerleader from
                        my freshman orientation. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hello, Luke.” Kelli smiled. She was wearing a red dress and she looked
                        awesome, but I’d seen
                        her real form. I knew what she was hiding: mismatched legs, red eyes, fangs, and flaming hair.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What is it, demon?” Luke’s voice was cold. “I told you not to disturb me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kelli pouted. “That’s not very nice. You look tense. How about a nice shoulder
                        massage?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke stepped back. “If you have something to report, say it. Otherwise leave!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know why you’re so huffy these days. You <i class="calibre5">used
                        </i>to be fun to
                        hang around.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That was before I saw what you did to that boy in Seattle.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, he meant nothing to me,” Kelli said. “Just a snack, really. You know my
                        heart belongs to
                        you, Luke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thanks, but no thanks. Now report or get out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kelli shrugged. “Fine. The advance team is ready, as you requested. We can
                        leave—” She frowned.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What is it?” Luke asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A presence,” Kelli said. “Your senses are getting dull, Luke. We’re being
                        watched.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She scanned the stateroom. Her eyes focused right on me. Her face withered into
                        a hag’s. She
                        bared her fangs and lunged. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I woke with a start, my heart pounding. I could’ve sworn the <i
                            class="calibre5">empousa</i>’s
                        fangs were an inch from my throat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson was snoring in the next bunk. The sound calmed me down a little. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know how Kelli could sense me in a dream, but I’d heard more than I
                        wanted to know. An
                        army was ready. Kronos would lead it personally. All they needed was a way to navigate the
                        Labyrinth so they
                        could invade and destroy Camp Half-Blood, and Luke apparently thought that was going to happen
                        very soon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was tempted to go wake up Annabeth and tell her, middle of the night or not.
                        Then I realized
                        the room was lighter than it should have been. A blue-and-green glow was coming from the
                        saltwater fountain,
                        brighter and more urgent than the night before. It was almost like the water was humming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got out of bed and approached. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No voice spoke out of the water this time, asking for a deposit. I got the
                        feeling the fountain
                        was waiting for me to make the first move. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I probably should’ve gone back to bed. Instead I thought about what I’d seen
                        last night—the
                        weird image of Nico at the banks of the River Styx. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re trying to tell me something,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No response from the fountain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All right,” I said. “Show me Nico di Angelo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t even throw a coin in, but this time it didn’t matter. It was like some
                        other force had
                        control of the water besides Iris the messenger goddess. The water shimmered. Nico appeared, but
                        he was no
                        longer in the Underworld. He was standing in a graveyard under a starry sky. Giant willow trees
                        loomed all
                        around him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was watching some gravediggers at work. I heard shovels and saw dirt flying
                        out of a hole.
                        Nico was dressed in a black cloak. The night was foggy. It was warm and humid, and frogs were
                        croaking. A large
                        Wal-Mart bag sat next to Nico’s feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Is it deep enough yet?” Nico asked. He sounded irritated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nearly, my lord.” It was the same ghost I’d seen Nico with before, the faint
                        shimmering image
                        of a man. “But, my lord, I tell you, this is unnecessary. You already have me for advice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I want a second opinion!” Nico snapped his fingers, and the digging stopped.
                        Two figures
                        climbed out of the hole. They weren’t people. They were skeletons in ragged clothes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You are dismissed,” Nico said. “Thank you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The skeletons collapsed into piles of bones. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You might as well thank the shovels,” the ghost complained. “They have as much
                        sense.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico ignored him. He reached into his Wal-Mart bag and pulled out a twelve-pack
                        of Coke. He
                        popped open a can. Instead of drinking it, he poured it into the grave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Let the dead taste again,” he murmured. “Let them rise and take this offering.
                        Let them
                        remember.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He dropped the rest of the Cokes into the grave and pulled out a white paper
                        bag decorated with
                        cartoons. I hadn’t seen one in years, but I recognized it—a McDonald’s Happy Meal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He turned it upside down and shook the fries and hamburger into the grave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“In my day, we used animal blood,” the ghost mumbled. “It’s perfectly good
                        enough. They can’t
                        taste the difference.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I will treat them with respect,” Nico said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“At least let me keep the toy,” the ghost said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Be quiet!” Nico ordered. He emptied another twelve-pack of soda and three more
                        Happy Meals
                        into the grave, then began chanting in Ancient Greek. I caught only some of the words—a lot
                        about the dead and
                        memories and returning from the grave. Real happy stuff. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The grave started to bubble. Frothy brown liquid rose to the top like the whole
                        thing was
                        filling with soda. The fog thickened. The frogs stopped croaking. Dozens of figures began to
                        appear among the
                        gravestones: bluish, vaguely human shapes. Nico had summoned the dead with Coke and
                        cheeseburgers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There are too many,” the ghost said nervously. “You don’t know your own
                        powers.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve got it under control,” Nico said, though his voice sounded fragile. He
                        drew his sword—a
                        short blade made of solid black metal. I’d never seen anything like it. It wasn’t celestial
                        bronze or steel.
                        Iron, maybe? The crowd of shades retreated at the sight of it. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/5-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“One at a time,” Nico commanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A single figure floated forward and knelt at the pool. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It made slurping sounds as it drank. Its ghostly hands scooped french fries out
                        of the pool.
                        When it stood again, I could see it much more clearly—a teenage guy in Greek armor. He had curly
                        hair and green
                        eyes, a clasp shaped like a seashell on his cloak. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who are you?” Nico said. “Speak.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The young man frowned as if trying to remember. Then he spoke in a voice like
                        dry, crumpling
                        paper: “I am Theseus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No way, I thought. This couldn’t be <i class="calibre5">the </i>Theseus. He was
                        just a kid. I’d
                        grown up hearing stories about him fighting the Minotaur and stuff, but I’d always pictured him
                        as this huge,
                        buff guy. The ghost I was looking at wasn’t strong or tall. And he wasn’t any older than I was.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How can I retrieve my sister?” Nico asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Theseus’s eyes were lifeless as glass. “Do not try. It is madness.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just tell me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My stepfather died,” Theseus remembered. “He threw himself into the sea
                        because he thought I
                        was dead in the Labyrinth. I wanted to bring him back, but I could not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico’s ghost hissed, “My lord, the soul exchange! Ask him about that!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Theseus scowled. “That voice. I know that voice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No you don’t, fool!” the ghost said. “Answer the lord’s questions and nothing
                        more!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know you,” Theseus insisted, as if struggling to recall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I want to hear about my sister,” Nico said. “Will this quest into the
                        Labyrinth help me win
                        her back?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Theseus was looking for the ghost, but apparently couldn’t see him. Slowly he
                        turned his eyes
                        back on Nico. “The Labyrinth is treacherous. There is only one thing that saw me through: the
                        love of a mortal
                        girl. The string was only part of the answer. It was the princess who guided me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We don’t need any of that,” the ghost said. “I will guide you, my lord. Ask
                        him if it is true
                        about an exchange of souls. He will tell you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A soul for a soul,” Nico asked. “Is it true?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I must say yes. But the specter—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just answer the questions, knave!” the ghost said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Suddenly, around the edges of the pool, the other ghosts became restless. They
                        stirred,
                        whispering in nervous tones. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I want to see my sister!” Nico demanded. “Where is she?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He is coming,” Theseus said fearfully. “He has sensed your summons. He comes.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who?” Nico demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He comes to find the source of this power,” Theseus said. “You must release
                        us!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/5-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The water in my fountain began to tremble, humming with power. I realized the
                        whole cabin was
                        shaking. The noise grew louder. The image of Nico in the graveyard started to glow until it was
                        painful to
                        watch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stop,” I said out loud. “Stop it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The fountain began to crack. Tyson muttered in his sleep and turned over.
                        Purple light threw
                        horrible, ghostly shadows on the cabin walls, as if the specters were escaping right out of the
                        fountain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In desperation I uncapped Riptide and slashed at the fountain, cleaving it in
                        two. Salt water
                        spilled everywhere, and the great stone font crashed to the floor in pieces. Tyson snorted and
                        muttered, but he
                        kept sleeping. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/5-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I sank to the ground, shivering from what I’d seen. Tyson found me there in the
                        morning, still
                        staring at the shattered remains of the saltwater fountain. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Just after dawn, the quest group met at Zeus’s Fist. I’d packed my
                        knapsack—thermos with
                        nectar, baggie of ambrosia, bedroll, rope, clothes, flashlights, and lots of extra batteries. I
                        had Riptide in
                        my pocket. The magic shield/ wristwatch Tyson had made for me was on my wrist. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was a clear morning. The fog had burned off and the sky was blue. Campers
                        would be having
                        their lessons today, flying pegasi and practicing archery and scaling the lava wall. Meanwhile,
                        we would be
                        heading underground. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper and Grover stood apart from the group. Juniper had been crying again,
                        but she was
                        trying to keep it together for Grover’s sake. She kept fussing with his clothes, straightening
                        his rasta cap and
                        brushing goat fur off his shirt. Since we had no idea what we would encounter, he was dressed as
                        a human, with
                        the cap to hide his horns, and jeans, fake feet, and sneakers to hide his goat legs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron, Quintus, and Mrs. O’Leary stood with the other campers who’d come to
                        wish us well, but
                        there was too much activity for it to feel like a happy send-off. A couple of tents had been set
                        up by the rocks
                        for guard duty. Beckendorf and his siblings were working on a line of defensive spikes and
                        trenches. Chiron had
                        decided we needed to guard the Labyrinth exit at all times, just in case. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth was doing one last check on her supply pack. When Tyson and I came
                        over, she frowned.
                        “Percy, you look terrible.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He killed the water fountain last night,” Tyson confided. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” she asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I could explain, Chiron trotted over. “Well, it appears you are ready!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He tried to sound upbeat, but I could tell he was anxious. I didn’t want to
                        freak him out any
                        more, but I thought about last night’s dream, and before I could change my mind, I said, “Hey,
                        uh, Chiron, can I
                        ask you a favor while I’m gone?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Of course, my boy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Be right back, guys.” I nodded toward the woods. Chiron raised an eyebrow, but
                        he followed me
                        out of earshot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Last night,” I said, “I dreamed about Luke and Kronos.” I told him the
                        details. The news
                        seemed to weigh on his shoulders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I feared this,” Chiron said. “Against my father, Kronos, we would stand no
                        chance in a fight.”
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/5-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron rarely called Kronos his father. I mean, we all knew it was true.
                        Everybody in the Greek
                        world—god, monster, or Titan—was related to one another somehow. But it wasn’t exactly something
                        Chiron liked to
                        brag about. <i class="calibre5">Oh, my dad is the all-powerful evil Titan lord who wants to
                            destroy Western
                            Civilization. I want to be just like him when I grow up! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Do you know what he meant about a bargain?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I am not sure, but I fear they seek to make a deal with Daedalus. If the old
                        inventor is truly
                        alive, if he has not been driven insane by millennia in the Labyrinth…well, Kronos can find ways
                        to twist anyone
                        to his will.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not anyone,” I promised. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron managed a smile. “No. Perhaps not anyone. But, Percy, you must beware. I
                        have worried
                        for some time that Kronos may be looking for Daedalus for a different reason, not just passage
                        through the
                        maze.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What else would he want?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Something Annabeth and I were discussing. Do you remember what you told me
                        about your first
                        trip to the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>, the first time you saw the golden
                        coffin?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded. “Luke was talking about raising Kronos, little pieces of him
                        appearing in the coffin
                        every time someone new joined his cause.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And what did Luke say they would do when Kronos had risen completely?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A chill went down my spine. “He said they would make Kronos a new body, worthy
                        of the forges of
                        Hephaestus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Indeed,” Chiron said. “Daedalus was the world’s greatest inventor. He created
                        the Labyrinth,
                        but much more. Automatons, thinking machines…What if Kronos wishes Daedalus to make him a new
                        form?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That was a real pleasant thought. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ve got to get to Daedalus first,” I said, “and convince him not to.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron stared off into the trees. “One other thing I do not understand…this
                        talk of a last soul
                        joining their cause. That does not bode well.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I kept my mouth shut, but I felt guilty. I’d made the decision not to tell
                        Chiron about Nico
                        being a son of Hades. The mention of souls, though—What if Kronos knew about Nico? What if he
                        managed to turn
                        him evil? It was almost enough to make me want to tell Chiron, but I didn’t. For one thing, I
                        wasn’t sure Chiron
                        could do anything about it. I had to find Nico myself. I had to explain things to him, make him
                        listen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know,” I said at last. “But, uh, something Juniper said, maybe you
                        should hear.” I
                        told him how the tree nymph had seen Quintus poking around the rocks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron’s jaw tightened. “That does not surprise me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It doesn’t sur— you mean you knew?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, when Quintus showed up at camp offering his services…well, I would have
                        to be a fool
                        not to be suspicious.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then why did you let him in?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because sometimes it is better to have someone you mistrust close to you, so
                        that you can keep
                        an eye on him. He may be just what he says: a half-blood in search of a home. Certainly he has
                        done nothing
                        openly that would make me question his loyalty. But believe me, I will keep an eye—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth trudged over, probably curious why we were taking so long. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, you ready?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded. My hand slipped into my pocket, where I kept the ice whistle Quintus
                        had given me. I
                        looked over and saw Quintus watching me carefully. He raised his hand in farewell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Our spies report success</i>, Luke had said. The same day
                        we decided to
                        send a quest, Luke had known about it. “Take care,” Chiron told us. “And good hunting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You too,” I said. We walked over to the rocks, where Tyson and Grover were
                        waiting. I stared
                        at the crack between the boulders— the entrance that was about to swallow us. “Well,” Grover
                        said nervously,
                        “good-bye sunshine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hello rocks,” Tyson agreed. And together, the four of us descended into
                        darkness. </p>

                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">We made it a hundred feet before we were hopelessly lost. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The tunnel looked nothing like the one Annabeth and I had stumbled into before.
                        Now it was
                        round like a sewer, constructed of red brick with iron-barred portholes every ten feet. I shined
                        a light through
                        one of the portholes out of curiosity, but I couldn’t see anything. It opened into infinite
                        darkness. I thought
                        I heard voices on the other side, but it may have been just the cold wind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth tried her best to guide us. She had this idea that we should stick to
                        the left wall.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If we keep one hand on the left wall and follow it,” she said, “we should be
                        able to find our
                        way out again by reversing course.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Unfortunately, as soon as she said that, the left wall disappeared. We found
                        ourselves in the
                        middle of a circular chamber with eight tunnels leading out, and no idea how we’d gotten there.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um, which way did we come in?” Grover said nervously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just turn around,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We each turned toward a different tunnel. It was ridiculous. None of us could
                        decide which way
                        led back to camp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Left walls are mean,” Tyson said. “Which way now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth swept her flashlight beam over the archways of the eight tunnels. As
                        far as I could
                        tell, they were identical. “That way,” she said. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/6-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“How do you know?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Deductive reasoning.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So…you’re guessing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just come on,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The tunnel she’d chosen narrowed quickly. The walls turned to gray cement, and
                        the ceiling got
                        so low that pretty soon we were hunching over. Tyson was forced to crawl. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover’s hyperventilating was the loudest noise in the maze. “I can’t stand it
                        anymore,” he
                        whispered. “Are we there yet?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ve been down here maybe five minutes,” Annabeth told him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s been longer than that,” Grover insisted. “And why would Pan be down here?
                        This is the
                        opposite of the wild!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We kept shuffling forward. Just when I was sure the tunnel would get so narrow
                        it would squish
                        us, it opened into a huge room. I shined my light around the walls and said, “Whoa.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The whole room was covered in mosaic tiles. The pictures were grimy and faded,
                        but I could
                        still make out the colors—red, blue, green, gold. The frieze showed the Olympian gods at a
                        feast. There was my
                        dad, Poseidon, with his trident, holding out grapes for Dionysus to turn into wine. Zeus was
                        partying with
                        satyrs, and Hermes was flying through the air on his winged sandals. The pictures were
                        beautiful, but they
                        weren’t very accurate. I’d seen the gods. Dionysus was not that handsome, and Hermes’s nose
                        wasn’t that big.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the middle of the room was a three-tiered fountain. It looked like it hadn’t
                        held water in a
                        long time. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/6-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“What is this place?” I muttered. “It looks—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Roman,” Annabeth said. “Those mosaics are about two thousand years old.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But how can they be Roman?” I wasn’t that great on ancient history, but I was
                        pretty sure the
                        Roman Empire never made it as far as Long Island. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Labyrinth is a patchwork,” Annabeth said. “I told you, it’s always
                        expanding, adding
                        pieces. It’s the only work of architecture that grows by itself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You make it sound like it’s alive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A groaning noise echoed from the tunnel in front of us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Let’s not talk about it being alive,” Grover whimpered. “Please?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All right,” Annabeth said. “Forward.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Down the hall with the bad sounds?” Tyson said. Even he looked nervous. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” Annabeth said. “The architecture is getting older. That’s a good sign.
                        Daedalus’s
                        workshop would be in the oldest part.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That made sense. But soon the maze was toying with us—we went fifty feet and
                        the tunnel turned
                        back to cement, with brass pipes running down the sides. The walls were spray-painted with
                        graffiti. A neon
                        tagger sign read MOZ RULZ. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m thinking this is not Roman,” I said helpfully. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth took a deep breath, then forged ahead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Every few feet the tunnels twisted and turned and branched off. The floor
                        beneath us changed
                        from cement to mud to bricks and back again. There was no sense to any of it. We stumbled into a
                        wine cellar—a
                        bunch of dusty bottles in wooden racks—like we were walking through somebody’s basement, only
                        there was no exit
                        above us, just more tunnels leading on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Later the ceiling turned to wooden planks, and I could hear voices above us and
                        the creaking of
                        footsteps, as if we were walking under some kind of bar. It was reassuring to hear people, but
                        then again, we
                        couldn’t get to them. We were stuck down here with no way out. Then we found our first skeleton.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was dressed in white clothes, like some kind of uniform. A wooden crate of
                        glass bottles sat
                        next to him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A milkman,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They used to deliver milk.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, I know what they are, but…that was when my mom was little, like a
                        million years ago.
                        What’s he doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Some people wander in by mistake,” Annabeth said. “Some come exploring on
                        purpose and never
                        make it back. A long time ago, the Cretans even sent people in here as human sacrifices.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover gulped. “He’s been down here a long time.” He pointed to the skeleton’s
                        bottles, which
                        were coated with white dust. The skeleton’s fingers were clawing at the brick wall, like he had
                        died trying to
                        get out. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/6-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Only bones,” Tyson said. “Don’t worry, goat boy. The milkman is dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The milkman doesn’t bother me,” Grover said. “It’s the smell. Monsters. Can’t
                        you smell it?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson nodded. “Lots of monsters. But underground smells like that. Monsters and
                        dead milk
                        people.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, good,” Grover whimpered. “I thought maybe I was wrong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We have to get deeper into the maze,” Annabeth said. “There has to be a way to
                        the center.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She led us to the right, then the left, through a corridor of stainless steel
                        like some kind of
                        air shaft, and we arrived back in the Roman tile room with the fountain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">This time, we weren’t alone. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">What I noticed first were his faces. Both of them. They jutted out from either
                        side of his
                        head, staring over his shoulders, so his head was much wider than it should’ve been, kind of
                        like a hammerhead
                        shark’s. Looking straight at him, all I saw were two overlapping ears and mirror-image
                        sideburns. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was dressed like a New York City doorman: a long black overcoat, shiny
                        shoes, and a black
                        top-hat that somehow managed to stay on his double-wide head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, Annabeth?” said his left face. “Hurry up!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t mind him,” said the right face. “He’s terribly rude. Right this way,
                        miss.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/6-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s jaw dropped. “Uh…I don’t…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson frowned. “That funny man has two faces.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The funny man has ears, you know!” the left face scolded. “Now come along,
                        miss.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, no,” the right face said. “This way, miss. Talk to <i
                            class="calibre5">me</i>, please.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The two-faced man regarded Annabeth as best he could out of the corners of his
                        eyes. It was
                        impossible to look at him straight on without focusing on one side or the other. And suddenly I
                        realized that’s
                        what he was asking—he wanted Annabeth to choose. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind him were two exits, blocked by wooden doors with huge iron locks. They
                        hadn’t been there
                        our first time through the room. The two-faced doorman held a silver key, which he kept passing
                        from his left
                        hand to his right hand. I wondered if this was a different room completely, but the frieze of
                        the gods looked
                        exactly the same. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind us, the doorway we’d come through had disappeared, replaced by more
                        mosaics. We wouldn’t
                        be going back the way we came. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The exits are closed,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Duh!” the man’s left face said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where do they lead?” she asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“One probably leads the way you wish to go,” the right face said encouragingly.
                        “The other
                        leads to certain death.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I know who you are,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, you’re a smart one!” The left face sneered. “But do you know which way to
                        choose? I don’t
                        have all day.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why are you trying to confuse me?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The right face smiled. “You’re in charge now, my dear. All the decisions are on
                        your shoulders.
                        That’s what you wanted, isn’t it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We know you, Annabeth,” the left face said. “We know what you wrestle with
                        every day. We know
                        your indecision. You will have to make your choice sooner or later. And the choice may kill
                        you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what they were talking about, but it sounded like it was about
                        more than a choice
                        between doors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The color drained out of Annabeth’s face. “No…I don’t—” </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“Leave her alone,” I said. “Who are you, anyway?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m your best friend,” the right face said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m your worst enemy,” the left face said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m Janus,” both faces said in harmony. “God of Doorways. Beginnings. Endings.
                        Choices.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll see you soon enough, Perseus Jackson,” said the right face. “But for now
                        it’s Annabeth’s
                        turn.” He laughed giddily. “Such fun!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shut up!” his left face said. “This is serious. One bad choice can ruin your
                        whole life. It
                        can kill you and all your friends. But no pressure, Annabeth. Choose!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">With a sudden chill, I remembered the words of the prophecy: <i
                            class="calibre5">the child of
                            Athena’s final stand. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t do it,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m afraid she has to,” the right face said cheerfully. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth moistened her lips. “I—I choose—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before she could point to a door, a brilliant light flooded the room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Janus raised his hands to either side of his head to cover his eyes. When the
                        light died, a
                        woman was standing at the fountain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was tall and graceful with long hair the color of chocolate, braided in
                        plaits with gold
                        ribbons. She wore a simple white dress, but when she moved, the fabric shimmered with colors
                        like oil on water.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Janus,” she said, “are we causing trouble again?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“N-no, milady!” Janus’s right face stammered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes!” the left face said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shut up!” the right face said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Excuse me?” the woman asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not you, milady! I was talking to myself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I see,” the lady said. “You know very well your visit is premature. The girl’s
                        time has not
                        yet come. So I give <i class="calibre5">you </i>a choice: leave these heroes to me, or I shall
                        turn <i class="calibre5">you </i>into a door and break you down.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What kind of door?” the left face asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shut up!” the right face said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because French doors are nice,” the left face mused. “Lots of natural light.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shut up!” the right face wailed. “Not you, milady! Of course I’ll leave. I was
                        just having a
                        bit of fun. Doing my job. Offering choices.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Causing indecision,” the woman corrected. “Now be gone!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The left face muttered, “Party pooper,” then he raised his silver key, inserted
                        it into the
                        air, and disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The woman turned toward us, and fear closed around my heart. Her eyes shined
                        with power. <i class="calibre5">Leave these heroes to me. </i>That didn’t sound good. For a
                        second, I almost wished we
                        could’ve taken our chances with Janus. But then the woman smiled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You must be hungry,” she said. “Sit with me and talk.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She waved her hand, and the old Roman fountain began to flow. Jets of clear
                        water sprayed into
                        the air. A marble table appeared, laden with platters of sandwiches and pitchers of lemonade.

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who…who are you?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I am Hera.” The woman smiled. “Queen of Heaven.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d seen Hera once before at a Council of the Gods, but I hadn’t paid much
                        attention to her. At
                        the time I’d been surrounded by a bunch of other gods who were debating whether or not to kill
                        me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t remember her looking so normal. Of course, gods are usually twenty
                        feet tall when
                        they’re on Olympus, so that makes them look a lot less normal. But now, Hera looked like a
                        regular mom. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She served us sandwiches and poured lemonade. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover, dear,” she said, “use your napkin. Don’t eat it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, ma’am,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tyson, you’re wasting away. Would you like another peanut butter sandwich?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson stifled a belch. “Yes, nice lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Queen Hera,” Annabeth said. “I can’t believe it. What are you doing in the
                        Labyrinth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hera smiled. She flicked one finger and Annabeth’s hair combed itself. All the
                        dirt and grime
                        disappeared from her face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I came to see you, naturally,” the goddess said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and I exchanged nervous looks. Usually when gods come looking for you,
                        it’s not out of
                        the goodness of their hearts. It’s because they want something. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/6-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Still, that didn’t keep me from chowing down on turkey-and-Swiss sandwiches and
                        chips and
                        lemonade. I hadn’t realized how hungry I was. Tyson was inhaling one peanut butter sandwich
                        after another, and
                        Grover was loving the lemonade, crunching the Styrofoam cup like an ice-cream cone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I didn’t think—” Annabeth faltered. “Well, I didn’t think you liked heroes.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hera smiled indulgently. “Because of that little spat I had with Hercules?
                        Honestly, I got so
                        much bad press because of one disagreement.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Didn’t you try to kill him, like, a lot of times?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hera waved her hand dismissively. “Water under the bridge, my dear. Besides, he
                        was one of my
                        loving husband’s children by <i class="calibre5">another </i>woman. My patience wore thin, I’ll
                        admit it. But
                        Zeus and I have had some excellent marriage counseling sessions since then. We’ve aired our
                        feelings and come to
                        an understanding—especially after that last little incident.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean when he sired Thalia?” I guessed, but immediately wished I hadn’t. As
                        soon as I said
                        the name of our friend, the half-blood daughter of Zeus, Hera’s eyes turned toward me frostily.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/6-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy Jackson, isn’t it? One of Poseidon’s…children.” I got the feeling she
                        was thinking of
                        another word besides <i class="calibre5">children</i>. “As I recall, I voted to let you live at
                        the winter
                        solstice. I hope I voted correctly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She turned back to Annabeth with a sunny smile. “At any rate, I certainly bear
                        you no ill will,
                        my girl. I appreciate the difficulty of your quest. Especially when you have troublemakers like
                        Janus to deal
                        with.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth lowered her gaze. “Why was he here? He was driving me crazy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Trying to,” Hera agreed. “You must understand, the minor gods like Janus have
                        always been
                        frustrated by the small parts they play in the universe. Some, I fear, have little love for
                        Olympus, and could
                        easily be swayed to support the rise of my father.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your father?” I said. “Oh. Right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d forgotten that Kronos was Hera’s dad, too, along with being father to Zeus,
                        Poseidon, and
                        all the eldest Olympians. I guess that made Kronos my grandfather, but that thought was so weird
                        I put it out of
                        my mind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We must watch the minor gods,” Hera said. “Janus. Hecate. Morpheus. They give
                        lip service to
                        Olympus, and yet—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s where Dionysus went,” I remembered. “He was checking on the minor
                        gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Indeed.” Hera stared at the fading mosaics of the Olympians. “You see, in
                        times of trouble,
                        even gods can lose faith. They start putting their trust in the wrong things, petty things. They
                        stop looking at
                        the big picture and start being selfish. But I’m the goddess of marriage, you see. I’m used to
                        perseverance. You
                        have to rise above the squabbling and chaos, and keep believing. You have to always keep your
                        goals in mind.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What are your goals?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She smiled. “To keep my family, the Olympians, together, of course. At the
                        moment, the best way
                        I can do that is by helping you. Zeus does not allow me to interfere much, I am afraid. But once
                        every century
                        or so, for a quest I care deeply about, he allows me to grant a wish.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A wish?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Before you ask it, let me give you some advice, which I can do for free. I
                        know you seek
                        Daedalus. His Labyrinth is as much a mystery to me as it is to you. But if you want to know his
                        fate, I would
                        visit my son Hephaestus at his forge. Daedalus was a great inventor, a mortal after Hephaestus’s
                        heart. There
                        has never been a mortal Hephaestus admired more. If anyone would have kept up with Daedalus and
                        could tell you
                        his fate, it is Hephaestus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But how do we get there?” Annabeth asked. “That’s my wish. I want a way to
                        navigate the
                        Labyrinth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hera looked disappointed. “So be it. You wish for something, however, that you
                        have already
                        been given.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t understand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The means is already within your grasp.” She looked at me. “Percy knows the
                        answer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I do?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But that’s not fair,” Annabeth said. “You’re not telling us what it is!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hera shook her head. “Getting something and having the wits to use it…those are
                        two different
                        things. I’m sure your mother Athena would agree.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The room rumbled like distant thunder. Hera stood. “That would be my cue. Zeus
                        grows impatient.
                        Think on what I have said, Annabeth. Seek out Hephaestus. You will have to pass through the
                        ranch, I imagine.
                        But keep going. And use all the means at your disposal, however common they may seem.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pointed toward the two doors and they melted away, revealing twin
                        corridors, open and dark.
                        “One last thing, Annabeth. I have postponed your day of choice. I have not prevented it. Soon,
                        as Janus said,
                        you <i class="calibre5">will </i>have to make a decision. Farewell!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">She waved a hand and turned into white smoke. So did the food, just as Tyson
                        chomped down on a
                        sandwich that turned to mist in his mouth. The fountain trickled to a stop. The mosaic walls
                        dimmed and turned
                        grungy and faded again. The room was no longer any place you’d want to have a picnic. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stamped her foot. “What sort of help was that? ‘Here, have a sandwich.
                        Make a wish.
                        Oops, I can’t help you!’ Poof!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Poof,” Tyson agreed sadly, looking at his empty plate. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well,” Grover sighed, “she said Percy knows the answer. That’s something.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They all looked at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But I don’t,” I said. “I don’t know what she was talking about.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth sighed. “All right. Then we’ll just keep going.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Which way?” I asked. I really wanted to ask what Hera had meant—about the
                        choice Annabeth
                        needed to make. But then Grover and Tyson both tensed. They stood up together, like they’d
                        rehearsed it. “Left,”
                        they both said. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth frowned. “How can you be sure?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because something is coming from the right,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Something big,” Tyson agreed. “In a hurry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Left is sounding pretty good,” I decided. Together we plunged into the dark
                        corridor. </p>

                <div class="chapter-text">
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The good news: the left tunnel was straight with no side exits, twists, or
                        turns. The bad news:
                        it was a dead end. After sprinting a hundred yards, we ran into an enormous boulder that
                        completely blocked our
                        path. Behind us, the sounds of dragging footsteps and heavy breathing echoed down the corridor.
                        Something—definitely not human— was on our tail. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tyson,” I said, “can you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes!” He slammed his shoulder against the rock so hard the whole tunnel shook.
                        Dust trickled
                        from the stone ceiling. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/7-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hurry!” Grover said. “Don’t bring the roof down, but hurry!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The boulder finally gave way with a horrible grinding noise. Tyson pushed it
                        into a small room
                        and we dashed through behind it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Close the entrance!” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We all got on the other side of the boulder and pushed. Whatever was chasing us
                        wailed in
                        frustration as we heaved the rock back into place and sealed the corridor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We trapped it,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Or trapped ourselves,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned. We were in a twenty-foot-square cement room, and the opposite wall
                        was covered with
                        metal bars. We’d tunneled straight into a cell. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“What in Hades?” Annabeth tugged on the bars. They didn’t budge. Through the
                        bars we could see
                        rows of cells in a ring around a dark courtyard—at least three stories of metal doors and metal
                        catwalks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A prison,” I said. “Maybe Tyson can break—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shh,” said Grover. “Listen.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Somewhere above us, deep sobbing echoed through the building. There was another
                        sound, too—a
                        raspy voice muttering something that I couldn’t make out. The words were strange, like rocks in
                        a tumbler. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s that language?” I whispered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson’s eye widened. “Can’t be.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He grabbed two bars on our cell door and bent them wide enough for even a
                        Cyclops to slip
                        through. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait!” Grover called. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But Tyson wasn’t about to wait. We ran after him. The prison was dark, only a
                        few dim
                        fluorescent lights flickering above. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know this place,” Annabeth told me. “This is Alcatraz.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean that island near San Francisco?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She nodded. “My school took a field trip here. It’s like a museum.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It didn’t seem possible that we could’ve popped out of the Labyrinth on the
                        other side of the
                        country, but Annabeth had been living in San Francisco all year, keeping an eye on Mount
                        Tamalpais just across
                        the bay. She probably knew what she was talking about. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Freeze,” Grover warned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But Tyson kept going. Grover grabbed his arm and pulled him back with all his
                        strength. “Stop,
                        Tyson!” he whispered. “Can’t you see it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked where he was pointing, and my stomach did a somersault. On the
                        second-floor balcony,
                        across the courtyard, was a monster more horrible than anything I’d ever seen before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was sort of like a centaur, with a woman’s body from the waist up. But
                        instead of a horse’s
                        lower body, it had the body of a dragon—at least twenty feet long, black and scaly with enormous
                        claws and a
                        barbed tail. Her legs looked like they were tangled in vines, but then I realized they were
                        sprouting snakes,
                        hundreds of vipers darting around, constantly looking for something to bite. The woman’s hair
                        was also made of
                        snakes, like Medusa’s. Weirdest of all, around her waist, where the woman part met the dragon
                        part, her skin
                        bubbled and morphed, occasionally producing the heads of animals—a vicious wolf, a bear, a lion,
                        as if she were
                        wearing a belt of ever-changing creatures. I got the feeling I was looking at something half
                        formed, a monster
                        so old it was from the beginning of time, before shapes had been fully defined. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/7-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s her,” Tyson whimpered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Get down!” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We crouched in the shadows, but the monster wasn’t paying us any attention. It
                        seemed to be
                        talking to someone inside a cell on the second floor. That’s where the sobbing was coming from.
                        The dragon woman
                        said something in her weird rumbling language. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s she saying?” I muttered. “What’s that language?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The tongue of the old times.” Tyson shivered. “What Mother Earth spoke to
                        Titans and…her other
                        children. Before the gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You understand it?” I asked. “Can you translate?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson closed his eyes and began to speak in a horrible, raspy woman’s voice.
                        “You will work for
                        the master or suffer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shuddered. “I hate it when he does that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Like all Cyclopes, Tyson had superhuman hearing and an uncanny ability to mimic
                        voices. It was
                        almost like he entered a trance when he spoke in other voices. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I will not serve,” Tyson said in a deep, wounded voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He switched to the monster’s voice: “Then I shall enjoy your pain, Briares.”
                        Tyson faltered
                        when he said that name. I’d never heard him break character when he was mimicking somebody, but
                        he let out a
                        strangled gulp. Then he continued in the monster’s voice. “If you thought your first
                        imprisonment was
                        unbearable, you have yet to feel true torment. Think on this until I return.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The dragon lady tromped toward the stairwell, vipers hissing around her legs
                        like grass skirts.
                        She spread wings that I hadn’t noticed before—huge bat wings she kept folded against her dragon
                        back. She leaped
                        off the catwalk and soared across the courtyard. We crouched lower in the shadows. A hot
                        sulfurous wind blasted
                        my face as the monster flew over. Then she disappeared around the corner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“H-h-horrible,” Grover said. “I’ve never smelled any monster that strong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cyclopes’ worst nightmare,” Tyson murmured. “Kampê.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson swallowed. “Every Cyclops knows about her. Stories about her scare us
                        when we’re babies.
                        She was our jailer in the bad years.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth nodded. “I remember now. When the Titans ruled, they imprisoned Gaea
                        and Ouranos’s
                        earlier children— the Cyclopes and the Hekatonkheires.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Heka-what?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Hundred-Handed Ones,” she said. “They called them that because…well, they
                        had a hundred
                        hands. They were elder brothers of the Cyclopes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Very powerful,” Tyson said. “Wonderful! As tall as the sky. So strong they
                        could break
                        mountains!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cool,” I said. “Unless you’re a mountain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Kampê was the jailer,” he said. “She worked for Kronos. She kept our brothers
                        locked up in
                        Tartarus, tortured them always, until Zeus came. He killed Kampê and freed Cyclopes and
                        Hundred-Handed Ones to
                        help fight against the Titans in the big war.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And now Kampê is back,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Bad,” Tyson summed up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So who’s in that cell?” I asked. “You said a name—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Briares!” Tyson perked up. “He is a Hundred-Handed One. They are as tall as
                        the sky and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” I said. “They break mountains.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked up at the cells above us, wondering how something as tall as the sky
                        could fit in a
                        tiny cell, and why he was crying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I guess we should check it out,” Annabeth said, “before Kampê comes back.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">As we approached the cell, the weeping got louder. When I first saw the
                        creature inside, I
                        wasn’t sure what I was looking at. He was human-size and his skin was very pale, the color of
                        milk. He wore a
                        loincloth like a big diaper. His feet seemed too big for his body, with cracked dirty toenails,
                        eight toes on
                        each foot. But the top half of his body was the weird part. He made Janus look downright normal.
                        His chest
                        sprouted more arms than I could count, in rows, all around his body. The arms looked like normal
                        arms, but there
                        were so many of them, all tangled together, that his chest looked kind of like a forkful of
                        spaghetti somebody
                        had twirled together. Several of his hands were covering his face as he sobbed. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/7-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Either the sky isn’t as tall as it used to be,” I muttered, “or he’s short.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson didn’t pay any attention. He fell to his knees. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Briares!” he called. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The sobbing stopped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Great Hundred-Handed One!” Tyson said. “Help us!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Briares looked up. His face was long and sad, with a crooked nose and bad
                        teeth. He had deep
                        brown eyes—I mean completely brown with no whites or black pupils, like eyes formed out of clay.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Run while you can, Cyclops,” Briares said miserably. “I cannot even help
                        myself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You are a Hundred-Handed One!” Tyson insisted. “You can do anything!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Briares wiped his nose with five or six hands. Several others were fidgeting
                        with little pieces
                        of metal and wood from a broken bed, the way Tyson always played with spare parts. It was
                        amazing to watch. The
                        hands seemed to have a mind of their own. They built a toy boat out of wood, then disassembled
                        it just as fast.
                        Other hands were scratching at the cement floor for no apparent reason. Others were playing
                        rock, paper,
                        scissors. A few others were making ducky and doggie shadow puppets against the wall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I cannot,” Briares moaned. “Kampê is back! The Titans will rise and throw us
                        back into
                        Tartarus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Put on your brave face!” Tyson said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Immediately Briares’s face morphed into something else. Same brown eyes, but
                        otherwise totally
                        different features. He had an upturned nose, arched eyebrows, and a weird smile, like he was
                        trying to act
                        brave. But then his face turned back to what it had been before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No good,” he said. “My scared face keeps coming back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How did you do that?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth elbowed me. “Don’t be rude. The Hundred-Handed Ones have fifty
                        different faces.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Must make it hard to get a yearbook picture,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson was still entranced. “It will be okay, Briares! We will help you! Can I
                        have your
                        autograph?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Briares sniffled. “Do you have one hundred pens?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Guys,” Grover interrupted. “We have to get out of here. Kampê will be back.
                        She’ll sense us
                        sooner or later.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Break the bars,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes!” Tyson said, smiling proudly. “Briares can do it. He is very strong.
                        Stronger than
                        Cyclopes, even! Watch!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Briares whimpered. A dozen of his hands started playing patty-cake, but none of
                        them made any
                        attempt to break the bars. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If he’s so strong,” I said, “why is he stuck in jail?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth ribbed me again. “He’s terrified,” she whispered. “Kampê imprisoned
                        him in Tartarus
                        for thousands of years. How would you feel?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Hundred-Handed One covered his face again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Briares?” Tyson asked. “What…what is wrong? Show us your great strength!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tyson,” Annabeth said, “I think you’d better break the bars.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson’s smile melted slowly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I will break the bars,” he repeated. He grabbed the cell door and ripped it
                        off its hinges
                        like it was made of wet clay. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/7-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on, Briares,” Annabeth said. “Let’s get you out of here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She held out her hand. For a second, Briares’s face morphed to a hopeful
                        expression. Several of
                        his arms reached out, but twice as many slapped them away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I cannot,” he said. “She will punish me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s all right,” Annabeth promised. “You fought the Titans before, and you
                        won, remember?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I remember the war.” Briares’s face morphed again— furrowed brow and a pouting
                        mouth. His
                        brooding face, I guess. “Lightning shook the world. We threw many rocks. The Titans and the
                        monsters almost won.
                        Now they are getting strong again. Kampê said so.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t listen to her,” I said. “Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He didn’t move. I knew Grover was right. We didn’t have much time before Kampê
                        returned. But I
                        couldn’t just leave him here. Tyson would cry for weeks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“One game of rock, paper, scissors,” I blurted out. “If I win, you come with
                        us. If I lose,
                        we’ll leave you in jail.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth looked at me like I was crazy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Briares’s face morphed to doubtful. “I always win rock, paper, scissors.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then let’s do it!” I pounded my fist in my palm three times. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Briares did the same with all one hundred hands, which sounded like an army
                        marching three
                        steps forward. He came up with a whole avalanche of rocks, a classroom set of scissors, and
                        enough paper to make
                        a fleet of airplanes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I told you,” he said sadly. “I always—” His face morphed to confusion. “What
                        is that you
                        made?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A gun,” I told him, showing him my finger gun. It was a trick Paul Blofis had
                        pulled on me,
                        but I wasn’t going to tell him that. “A gun beats anything.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/7-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s not fair.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I didn’t say anything about fair. Kampê’s not going to be fair if we hang
                        around. She’s going
                        to blame you for ripping off the bars. Now come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Briares sniffled. “Demigods are cheaters.” But he slowly rose to his feet and
                        followed us out
                        of the cell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I started to feel hopeful. All we had to do was get downstairs and find the
                        Labyrinth entrance.
                        But then Tyson froze. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">On the ground floor right below, Kampê was snarling at us. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“The other way,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We bolted down the catwalk. This time Briares was happy to follow us. In fact
                        he sprinted out
                        front, a hundred arms waving in panic. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind us, I heard the sound of giant wings as Kampê took to the air. She
                        hissed and growled in
                        her ancient language, but I didn’t need a translation to know she was planning to kill us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We scrambled down the stairs, through a corridor, and past a guard’s
                        station—out into another
                        block of prison cells. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Left,” Annabeth said. “I remember this from the tour.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We burst outside and found ourselves in the prison yard, ringed by security
                        towers and barbed
                        wire. After being inside so long, the daylight almost blinded me. Tourists were milling around,
                        taking pictures.
                        The wind whipped cold off the bay. In the south, San Francisco gleamed all white and beautiful,
                        but in the
                        north, over Mount Tamalpais, huge storm clouds swirled. The whole sky seemed like a black top
                        spinning from the
                        mountain where Atlas was imprisoned, and where the Titan palace of Mount Othrys was rising anew.
                        It was hard to
                        believe the tourists couldn’t see the supernatural storm brewing, but they didn’t give any hint
                        that anything
                        was wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s even worse,” Annabeth said, gazing to the north. “The storms have been
                        bad all year, but
                        that—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Keep moving,” Briares wailed. “She is behind us!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We ran to the far end of the yard, as far from the cell-block as possible. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Kampê’s too big to get through the doors,” I said hopefully. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then the wall exploded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tourists screamed as Kampê appeared from the dust and rubble, her wings spread
                        out as wide as
                        the yard. She was holding two swords—long bronze scimitars that glowed with a weird greenish
                        aura, boiling wisps
                        of vapor that smelled sour and hot even across the yard. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/7-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Poison!” Grover yelped. “Don’t let those things touch you or…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Or we’ll die?” I guessed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well…after you shrivel slowly to dust, yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Let’s avoid the swords,” I decided. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Briares, fight!” Tyson urged. “Grow to full size!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Instead, Briares looked like he was trying to shrink even smaller. He appeared
                        to be wearing
                        his <i class="calibre5">absolutely terrified </i>face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kampê thundered toward us on her dragon legs, hundreds of snakes slithering
                        around her body.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a second I thought about drawing Riptide and facing her, but my heart
                        crawled into my
                        throat. Then Annabeth said what I was thinking: “Run.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That was the end of the debate. There was no fighting this thing. We ran
                        through the jail yard
                        and out the gates of the prison, the monster right behind us. Mortals screamed and ran.
                        Emergency sirens began
                        to blare. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We hit the wharf just as a tour boat was unloading. The new group of visitors
                        froze as they saw
                        us charging toward them, followed by a mob of frightened tourists, followed by…I don’t know what
                        they saw
                        through the Mist, but it could not have been good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The boat?” Grover asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Too slow,” Tyson said. “Back into the maze. Only chance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We need a diversion,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson ripped a metal lamppost out of the ground. “I will distract Kampê. You
                        run ahead.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/7-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll help you,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” Tyson said. “You go. Poison will hurt Cyclopes. A lot of pain. But it
                        won’t kill.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are you sure?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Go, brother. I will meet you inside.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hated the idea. I’d almost lost Tyson once before, and I didn’t want to ever
                        risk that again.
                        But there was no time to argue, and I had no better idea. Annabeth, Grover, and I each took one
                        of Briares’s
                        hands and dragged him toward the concession stands while Tyson bellowed, lowered his pole, and
                        charged Kampê
                        like a jousting knight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She’d been glaring at Briares, but Tyson got her attention as soon as he nailed
                        her in the
                        chest with the pole, pushing her back into the wall. She shrieked and slashed with her swords,
                        slicing the pole
                        to shreds. Poison dripped in pools all around her, sizzling into the cement. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson jumped back as Kampê’s hair lashed and hissed, and the vipers around her
                        legs darted
                        their tongues in every direction. A lion popped out of the weird half-formed faces around her
                        waist and roared.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As we sprinted for the cellblocks, the last thing I saw was Tyson picking up a
                        Dippin’ Dots
                        stand and throwing it at Kampê. Ice cream and poison exploded everywhere, all the little snakes
                        in Kampê’s hair
                        dotted with tutti-frutti. We dashed back into the jail yard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Can’t make it,” Briares huffed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tyson is risking his life to help you!” I yelled at him. “You <i
                            class="calibre5">will
                        </i>make it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As we reached the door of the cellblock, I heard an angry roar. I glanced back
                        and saw Tyson
                        running toward us at full speed, Kampê right behind him. She was plastered in ice cream and
                        T-shirts. One of the
                        bear heads on her waist was now wearing a pair of crooked plastic Alcatraz sunglasses. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hurry!” Annabeth said, like I needed to be told that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We finally found the cell where we’d come in, but the back wall was completely
                        smooth—no sign
                        of a boulder or anything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look for the mark!” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There!” Grover touched a tiny scratch, and it became a Greek Δ. The mark of
                        Daedalus glowed
                        blue, and the stone wall grinded open. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Too slowly. Tyson was coming through the cellblock, Kampê’s swords lashing out
                        behind him,
                        slicing indiscriminately through cell bars and stone walls. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I pushed Briares inside the maze, then Annabeth and Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You can do it!” I told Tyson. But immediately I knew he couldn’t. Kampê was
                        gaining. She
                        raised her swords. I needed a distraction—something big. I slapped my wristwatch and it spiraled
                        into a bronze
                        shield. Desperately, I threw it at the monster’s face. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">SMACK! </i>The shield hit her in the face and she faltered
                        just long enough
                        for Tyson to dive past me into the maze. I was right behind him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kampê charged, but she was too late. The stone door closed and its magic sealed
                        us in. I could
                        feel the whole tunnel shake as Kampê pounded against it, roaring furiously. We didn’t stick
                        around to play
                        knock, knock with her, though. We raced into the darkness, and for the first time (and the last)
                        I was glad to
                        be back in the Labyrinth. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">We finally stopped in a room full of waterfalls. The floor was one big pit,
                        ringed by a
                        slippery stone walkway. Around us, on all four walls, water tumbled from huge pipes. The water
                        spilled down into
                        the pit, and even when I shined a light, I couldn’t see the bottom. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/8-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Briares slumped against the wall. He scooped up water in a dozen hands and
                        washed his face.
                        “This pit goes straight to Tartarus,” he murmured. “I should jump in and save you trouble.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t talk that way,” Annabeth told him. “You can come back to camp with us.
                        You can help us
                        prepare. You know more about fighting Titans than anybody.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have nothing to offer,” Briares said. “I have lost everything.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What about your brothers?” Tyson asked. “The other two must still stand tall
                        as mountains! We
                        can take you to them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Briares’s expression morphed to something even sadder: his grieving face. “They
                        are no more.
                        They faded.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The waterfalls thundered. Tyson stared into the pit and blinked tears out of
                        his eye. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What exactly do you mean, <i class="calibre5">they faded</i>?” I asked. “I
                        thought monsters
                        were immortal, like the gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Grover said weakly, “even immortality has limits. Sometimes…sometimes
                        monsters get
                        forgotten and they lose their will to stay immortal.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Looking at Grover’s face, I wondered if he was thinking of Pan. I remembered
                        something Medusa
                        had told us once: how her sisters, the other two gorgons, had passed on and left her alone. Then
                        last year
                        Apollo said something about the old god Helios disappearing and leaving him with the duties of
                        the sun god. I’d
                        never thought about it too much, but now, looking at Briares, I realized how terrible it would
                        be to be so
                        old—thousands and thousands of years old— and totally alone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I must go,” Briares said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Kronos’s army will invade camp,” Tyson said. “We need help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Briares hung his head. “I cannot, Cyclops.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You are strong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not anymore.” Briares rose. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey.” I grabbed one of his arms and pulled him aside, where the roar of the
                        water would hide
                        our words. “Briares, we need you. In case you haven’t noticed, Tyson believes in you. He risked
                        his life for
                        you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told him about everything—Luke’s invasion plan, the Labyrinth entrance at
                        camp, Daedalus’s
                        workshop, Kronos’s golden coffin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Briares just shook his head. “I cannot, demigod. I do not have a finger gun to
                        win this game.”
                        To prove his point, he made one hundred finger guns. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe that’s why monsters fade,” I said. “Maybe it’s not about what the
                        mortals believe. Maybe
                        it’s because <i class="calibre5">you </i>give up on yourself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His pure brown eyes regarded me. His face morphed into an expression I
                        recognized—shame. Then
                        he turned and trudged off down the corridor until he was lost in the shadows. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/8-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson sobbed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s okay.” Grover hesitantly patted his shoulder, which must’ve taken all his
                        courage. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson sneezed. “It is not okay, goat boy. He was my hero.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to make him feel better, but I wasn’t sure what to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, Annabeth stood and shouldered her backpack. “Come on, guys. This pit
                        is making me
                        nervous. Let’s find a better place to camp for the night.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We settled in a corridor made of huge marble blocks. It looked like it could’ve
                        been part of a
                        Greek tomb, with bronze torch holders fastened to the walls. It had to be an older part of the
                        maze, and
                        Annabeth decided this was a good sign. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We must be close to Daedalus’s workshop,” she said. “Get some rest, everybody.
                        We’ll keep
                        going in the morning.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How do we know when it’s morning?” Grover asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just rest,” she insisted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover didn’t need to be told twice. He pulled a heap of straw out of his pack,
                        ate some of it,
                        made a pillow out of the rest, and was snoring in no time. Tyson took longer getting to sleep.
                        He tinkered with
                        some metal scraps from his building kit for a while, but whatever he was making, he wasn’t happy
                        with it. He
                        kept disassembling the pieces. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry I lost the shield,” I told him. “You worked so hard to repair it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson looked up. His eye was bloodshot from crying. “Do not worry, brother. You
                        saved me. You
                        wouldn’t have had to if Briares had helped.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He was just scared,” I said. “I’m sure he’ll get over it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He is not strong,” Tyson said. “He is not important anymore.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He heaved a big sad sigh, then closed his eye. The metal pieces fell out of his
                        hand, still
                        unassembled, and Tyson began to snore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to fall asleep myself, but I couldn’t. Something about getting chased
                        by a large dragon
                        lady with poison swords made it real hard to relax. I picked up my bedroll and dragged it over
                        to where Annabeth
                        was sitting, keeping watch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I sat down next to her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You should sleep,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Can’t. You doing all right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sure. First day leading the quest. Just great.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll get there,” I said. “We’ll find the workshop before Luke does.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She brushed her hair out of her face. She had a smudge of dirt on her chin, and
                        I imagined what
                        she must’ve looked like when she was little, wandering around the country with Thalia and Luke.
                        Once she’d saved
                        them from the mansion of the evil Cyclops when she was only seven. Even when she looked scared,
                        like now, I knew
                        she had a lot of guts. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I just wish the quest was <i class="calibre5">logical</i>,” she complained. “I
                        mean, we’re
                        traveling but we have no idea where we’ll end up. How can you walk from New York to California
                        in a day?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Space isn’t the same in the maze.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know, I know. It’s just…” She looked at me hesitantly. “Percy, I was kidding
                        myself. All
                        that planning and reading, I don’t have a clue where we’re going.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re doing great. Besides, we <i class="calibre5">never </i>know what we’re
                        doing. It always
                        works out. Remember Circe’s island?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She snorted. “You made a cute guinea pig.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And Waterland, how you got us thrown off that ride?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<i class="calibre5">I </i>got us thrown off ? That was totally your fault!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“See? It’ll be fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She smiled, which I was glad to see, but the smile faded quickly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, what did Hera mean when she said you knew the way to get through the
                        maze?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know,” I admitted. “Honestly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’d tell me if you did?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sure. Maybe…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe if you told me the last line of the prophecy, it would help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shivered. “Not here. Not in the dark.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What about the choice Janus mentioned? Hera said—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stop,” Annabeth snapped. Then she took a shaky breath. “I’m sorry, Percy. I’m
                        just stressed.
                        But I don’t…I’ve got to think about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We sat in silence, listening to strange creaks and groans in the maze, the echo
                        of stones
                        grinding together as tunnels changed, grew, and expanded. The dark made me think about the
                        visions I’d seen of
                        Nico di Angelo, and suddenly I realized something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nico is down here somewhere,” I said. “That’s how he disappeared from camp. He
                        found the
                        Labyrinth. Then he found a path that led down even farther—to the Underworld. But now he’s back
                        in the maze.
                        He’s coming after me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth was quiet for a long time. “Percy, I hope you’re wrong. But if you’re
                        right…” She
                        stared at the flashlight beam, casting a dim circle on the stone wall. I had a feeling she was
                        thinking about
                        her prophecy. I’d never seen her look more tired. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How about I take first watch?” I said. “I’ll wake you if anything happens.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth looked like she wanted to protest, but she just nodded, slumped onto
                        her bedroll, and
                        closed her eyes. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">When it was my turn to sleep, I dreamed I was back in the old man’s Labyrinth
                        prison. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It looked more like a workshop now. Tables were littered with measuring
                        instruments. A forge
                        burned red hot in the corner. The boy I’d seen in the last dream was stoking the bellows, except
                        he was taller
                        now, almost my age. A weird funnel device was attached to the forge’s chimney, trapping the
                        smoke and heat and
                        channeling it through a pipe into the floor, next to a big bronze manhole cover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was daytime. The sky above was blue, but the walls of the maze cast deep
                        shadows across the
                        workshop. After being in tunnels so long, I found it weird that part of the Labyrinth could be
                        open to the sky.
                        Somehow that made the maze seem like an even crueler place. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old man looked sickly. He was terribly thin, his hands raw and red from
                        working. White hair
                        covered his eyes, and his tunic was smudged with grease. He was bent over a table, working on
                        some kind of long
                        metal patch-work—like a swath of chain mail. He picked up a delicate curl of bronze and fitted
                        it into place.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Done,” he announced. “It’s done.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He picked up his project. It was so beautiful, my heart leaped—metal wings
                        constructed from
                        thousands of interlocking bronze feathers. There were two sets. One still lay on the table.
                        Daedalus stretched
                        the frame, and the wings expanded to twenty feet. Part of me knew it could never fly. It was too
                        heavy, and
                        there’d be no way to get off the ground. But the craftsmanship was amazing. Metal feathers
                        caught the light and
                        flashed thirty different shades of gold. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The boy left the bellows and ran over to see. He grinned, despite the fact that
                        he was grimy
                        and sweaty. “Father, you’re a genius!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old man smiled. “Tell me something I don’t know, Icarus. Now hurry. It will
                        take at least
                        an hour to attach them. Come.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You first,” Icarus said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old man protested, but Icarus insisted. “You made them, Father. You should
                        get the honor of
                        wearing them first.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The boy attached a leather harness to his father’s chest, like climbing gear,
                        with straps that
                        ran from his shoulders to his wrists. Then he began fastening on the wings, using a metal
                        canister that looked
                        like an enormous hot-glue gun. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The wax compound should hold for several hours,” Daedalus said nervously as
                        his son worked.
                        “But we must let it set first. And we would do well to avoid flying too high or too low. The sea
                        would wet the
                        wax seals—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And the sun’s heat would loosen them,” the boy finished. “Yes, Father. We’ve
                        been through this
                        a million times!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“One cannot be too careful.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have complete faith in your inventions, Father! No one has ever been as
                        smart as you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old man’s eyes shone. It was obvious he loved his son more than anything in
                        the world. “Now
                        I will do your wings, and give mine a chance to set properly. Come!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was slow going. The old man’s hands fumbled with the straps. He had a hard
                        time keeping the
                        wings in position while he sealed them. His own metal wings seemed to weigh him down, getting in
                        his way while
                        he tried to work. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Too slow,” the old man muttered. “I am too slow.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Take your time, Father,” the boy said. “The guards aren’t due until—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">BOOM! </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The workshop doors shuddered. Daedalus had barred them from the inside with a
                        wooden brace, but
                        still they shook on their hinges. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hurry!” Icarus said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">BOOM! BOOM! </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Something heavy was slamming into the doors. The brace held, but a crack
                        appeared in the left
                        door. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Daedalus worked furiously. A drop of hot wax spilled onto Icarus’s shoulder.
                        The boy winced but
                        did not cry out. When his left wing was sealed to the straps, Daedalus began working on the
                        right. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We must have more time,” Daedalus murmured. “They are too early! We need more
                        time for the
                        seal to hold.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’ll be fine,” Icarus said, as his father finished the right wing. “Help me
                        with the
                        manhole—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">CRASH! </i>The doors splintered and the head of a bronze
                        battering ram
                        emerged through the breach. Axes cleared the debris, and two armed guards entered the room,
                        followed by the king
                        with the golden crown and the spear-shaped beard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, well,” the king said with a cruel smile. “Going somewhere?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Daedalus and his son froze, their metal wings glimmering on their backs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re leaving, Minos,” the old man said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">King Minos chuckled. “I was curious to see how far you’d get on this little
                        project before I
                        dashed your hopes. I must say I’m impressed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The king admired their wings. “You look like metal chickens,” he decided.
                        “Perhaps we should
                        pluck you and make a soup.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The guards laughed stupidly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Metal chickens,” one repeated. “Soup.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shut up,” the king said. Then he turned again to Daedalus. “You let my
                        daughter escape, old
                        man. You drove my wife to madness. You killed my monster and made me the laughingstock of the
                        Mediterranean. You
                        will never escape me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Icarus grabbed the wax gun and sprayed it at the king, who stepped back in
                        surprise. The guards
                        rushed forward, but each got a stream of hot wax in his face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The vent!” Icarus yelled to his father. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Get them!” King Minos raged. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Together, the old man and his son pried open the manhole cover, and a column of
                        hot air blasted
                        out of the ground. The king watched, incredulous, as the inventor and son shot into the sky on
                        their bronze
                        wings, carried by the updraft. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shoot them!” the king yelled, but his guards had brought no bows. One threw
                        his sword in
                        desperation, but Daedalus and Icarus were already out of reach. They wheeled above the maze and
                        the king’s
                        palace, then zoomed across the city of Knossos and out past the rocky shores of Crete. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">Icarus laughed. “Free, Father! You did it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The boy spread his wings to their full limit and soared away on the wind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait!” Daedalus called. “Be careful!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But Icarus was already out over the open sea, heading north and delighting in
                        their good luck.
                        He soared up and scared an eagle out of its flight path, then plummeted toward the sea like he
                        was born to fly,
                        pulling out of a nosedive at the last second. His sandals skimmed the waves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stop that!” Daedalus called. But the wind carried his voice away. His son was
                        drunk on his own
                        freedom. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old man struggled to catch up, gliding clumsily after his son. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They were miles from Crete, over deep sea, when Icarus looked back and saw his
                        father’s worried
                        expression. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Icarus smiled. “Don’t worry, Father! You’re a genius! I trust your handiwork—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The first metal feather shook loose from his wings and fluttered away. Then
                        another. Icarus
                        wobbled in midair. Suddenly he was shedding bronze feathers, which twirled away from him like a
                        flock of
                        frightened birds. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Icarus!” his father cried. “Glide! Extend the wings. Stay as still as
                        possible!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But Icarus flapped his arms, desperately trying to reassert control. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The left wing went first—ripping away from the straps. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Father!” Icarus cried. And then he fell, the wings stripped away until he was
                        just a boy in a
                        climbing harness and a white tunic, his arms extended in a useless attempt to glide. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">I woke with a start, feeling like I was falling. The corridor was dark. In the
                        constant moaning
                        of the Labyrinth, I thought I could hear the anguished cry of Daedalus calling his son’s name,
                        as Icarus, his
                        only joy, plummeted toward the sea, three hundred feet below. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">There was no morning in the maze, but once everyone woke up and had a fabulous
                        breakfast of
                        granola bars and juice boxes, we kept traveling. I didn’t mention my dream. Something about it
                        had really
                        freaked me out, and I didn’t think the others needed to know that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old stone tunnels changed to dirt with cedar beams, like a gold mine or
                        something. Annabeth
                        started getting agitated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This isn’t right,” she said. “It should still be stone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We came to a cave where stalactites hung low from the ceiling. In the center of
                        the dirt floor
                        was a rectangular pit, like a grave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shivered. “It smells like the Underworld in here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I saw something glinting at the edge of the pit— a foil wrapper. I shined
                        my flashlight
                        into the hole and saw a half-chewed cheeseburger floating in brown carbonated muck. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“Nico,” I said. “He was summoning the dead again.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson whimpered. “Ghosts were here. I don’t like ghosts.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ve got to find him.” I don’t know why, but standing at the edge of that pit
                        gave me a sense
                        of urgency. Nico was close. I could feel it. I couldn’t let him wander around down here, alone
                        except for the
                        dead. I started to run. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Annabeth called. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I ducked into a tunnel and saw light up ahead. By the time Annabeth, Tyson, and
                        Grover caught
                        up with me, I was staring at daylight streaming through a set of bars above my head. We were
                        under a steel grate
                        made out of metal pipes. I could see trees and blue sky. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where are we?” I wondered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then a shadow fell across the grate and a cow stared down at me. It looked like
                        a normal cow
                        except it was a weird color—bright red, like a cherry. I didn’t know cows came in that color.

                    <p class="calibre14">The cow mooed, put one hoof tentatively on the bars, then backed away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s a cattle guard,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A what?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They put them at the gates of ranches so cows can’t get out. They can’t walk
                        on them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How do you know that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover huffed indignantly. “Believe me, if <i class="calibre5">you </i>had
                        hooves, you’d know
                        about cattle guards. They’re annoying!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned to Annabeth. “Didn’t Hera say something about a ranch? We need to
                        check it out. Nico
                        might be up there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She hesitated. “All right. But how do we get out?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson solved that problem by hitting the cattle guard with both hands. It
                        popped off and went
                        flying out of sight. We heard a <i class="calibre5">CLANG! </i>and a startled <i
                            class="calibre5">Moo! </i>Tyson
                        blushed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sorry, cow!” he called. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then he gave us a boost out of the tunnel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We were on a ranch, all right. Rolling hills stretched to the horizon, dotted
                        with oak trees
                        and cactuses and boulders. A barbed wire fence ran from the gate in either direction.
                        Cherry-colored cows roamed
                        around, grazing on clumps of grass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Red cattle,” Annabeth said. “The cattle of the sun.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They’re sacred to Apollo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Holy cows?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Exactly. But what are they doing—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait,” Grover said. “Listen.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At first everything seemed quiet…but then I heard it: the distant baying of
                        dogs. The sound got
                        louder. Then the underbrush rustled, and two dogs broke through. Except it wasn’t two dogs. It
                        was <i class="calibre5">one </i>dog with two heads. It looked like a greyhound, long and snaky
                        and sleek brown, but
                        its neck V’d into two heads, both of them snapping and snarling and generally not very glad to
                        see us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Bad Janus dog!” Tyson cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">“Arf!” </i>Grover told it, and raised a hand in greeting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The two-headed dog bared its teeth. I guess it wasn’t impressed that Grover
                        could speak animal.
                        Then its master lumbered out of the woods, and I realized the dog was the least of our problems.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was a huge guy with stark white hair, a straw cowboy hat, and a braided
                        white beard—kind of
                        like Father Time, if Father Time went redneck and got totally jacked. He was wearing jeans, a
                        DON’T MESS WITH
                        TEXAS T-shirt, and a denim jacket with the sleeves ripped off so you could see his muscles. On
                        his right bicep
                        was a crossed-swords tattoo. He held a wooden club about the size of a nuclear warhead, with
                        six-inch spikes
                        bristling at the business end. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Heel, Orthus,” he told the dog. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The dog growled at us once more, just to make his feelings clear, then circled
                        back to his
                        master’s feet. The man looked us up and down, keeping his club ready. </p>

                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/8-9.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’ve we got here?” he asked. “Cattle rustlers?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just travelers,” Annabeth said. “We’re on a quest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The man’s eye twitched. “Half-bloods, eh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I started to say, “How did you know—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth put her hand on my arm. “I’m Annabeth, daughter of Athena. This is
                        Percy, son of
                        Poseidon. Grover the satyr. Tyson the—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cyclops,” the man finished. “Yes, I can see that.” He glowered at me. “And I
                        know half-bloods
                        because I <i class="calibre5">am </i>one, sonny. I’m Eurytion, the cowherd for this here ranch.
                        Son of Ares. You
                        came through the Labyrinth like the other one, I reckon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The other one?” I asked. “You mean Nico di Angelo?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We get a load of visitors from the Labyrinth,” Eurytion said darkly. “Not many
                        ever leave.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wow,” I said. “I feel welcome.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The cowherd glanced behind him like someone was watching. Then he lowered his
                        voice. “I’m only
                        going to say this once, demigods. Get back in the maze now. Before it’s too late.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re not leaving,” Annabeth insisted. “Not until we see this other demigod.
                        Please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion grunted. “Then you leave me no choice, missy. I’ve got to take you to
                        see the boss.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t feel like we were hostages or anything. Eurytion walked alongside us
                        with his club
                        across his shoulder. Orthus the two-headed dog growled a lot and sniffed at Grover’s legs and
                        shot into the
                        bushes once in a while to chase animals, but Eurytion kept him more or less under control. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We walked down a dirt path that seemed to go on forever. It must’ve been close
                        to a hundred
                        degrees, which was a shock after San Francisco. Heat shimmered off the ground. Insects buzzed in
                        the trees.
                        Before we’d gone very far, I was sweating like crazy. Flies swarmed us. Every so often we’d see
                        a pen full of
                        red cows or even stranger animals. Once we passed a corral where the fence was coated in
                        asbestos. Inside, a
                        herd of fire-breathing horses milled around. The hay in their feeding trough was on fire. The
                        ground smoked
                        around their feet, but the horses seemed tame enough. One big stallion looked at me and
                        whinnied, columns of red
                        flame billowing out his nostrils. I wondered if it hurt his sinuses. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What are <i class="calibre5">they </i>for?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion scowled. “We raise animals for lots of clients. Apollo, Diomedes,
                        and…others.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Like who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No more questions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally we came out of the woods. Perched on a hill above us was a big ranch
                        house—all white
                        stone and wood and big windows. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It looks like a Frank Lloyd Wright!” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I guess she was talking about some architectural thing. To me it just looked
                        like the kind of
                        place where a few demigods could get into serious trouble. We hiked up the hill. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/8-10.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t break the rules,” Eurytion warned as we walked up the steps to the front
                        porch. “No
                        fighting. No drawing weapons. And don’t make any comments about the boss’s appearance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why?” I asked. “What does he look like?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before Eurytion could reply, a new voice said, “Welcome to the Triple G Ranch.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The man on the porch had a normal head, which was a relief. His face was
                        weathered and brown
                        from years in the sun. He had slick black hair and a black pencil moustache like villains have
                        in old movies. He
                        smiled at us, but the smile wasn’t friendly; more amused, like <i class="calibre5">Oh boy, more
                            people to
                            torture! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t ponder that very long, though, because then I noticed his body…or
                        bodies. He had three
                        of them. Now, you’d think I would’ve gotten used to weird anatomy after Janus and Briares, but
                        this guy was
                        three complete people. His neck connected to the middle chest like normal, but he had two more
                        chests, one to
                        either side, connected at the shoulders, with a few inches in between. His left arm grew out of
                        his left chest,
                        and the same on the right, so he had two arms, but four armpits, if that makes any sense. The
                        chests all
                        connected into one enormous torso, with two regular but very beefy legs, and he wore the most
                        oversized pair of
                        Levis I’d ever seen. His chests each wore a different color Western shirt—green, yellow, red,
                        like a stoplight.
                        I wondered how he dressed the middle chest, since it had no arms. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/8-11.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The cowherd Eurytion nudged me. “Say hello to Mr. Geryon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi,” I said. “Nice chests—uh, ranch! Nice ranch you have.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before the three-bodied man could respond, Nico di Angelo came out of the glass
                        doors onto the
                        porch. “Geryon, I won’t wait for—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He froze when he saw us. Then he drew his sword. The blade was just like I’d
                        seen in my dream:
                        short, sharp, and dark as midnight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon snarled when he saw it. “Put that away, Mr. di Angelo. I ain’t gonna
                        have my guests
                        killin’ each other.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But that’s—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy Jackson,” Geryon supplied. “Annabeth Chase. And a couple of their
                        monster friends. Yes,
                        I know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Monster friends?” Grover said indignantly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That man is wearing three shirts,” Tyson said, like he was just realizing
                        this. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They let my sister die!” Nico’s voice trembled with rage. “They’re here to
                        kill me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nico, we’re not here to kill you.” I raised my hands. “What happened to Bianca
                        was—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t speak her name! You’re not worthy to even talk about her!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait a minute.” Annabeth pointed at Geryon. “How do you know our names?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The three-bodied man winked. “I make it my business to keep informed, darlin’.
                        Everybody pops
                        into the ranch from time to time. Everyone needs something from ole Geryon. Now, Mr. di Angelo,
                        put that ugly
                        sword away before I have Eurytion take it from you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion sighed, but he hefted his spiked club. At his feet, Orthus growled.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico hesitated. He looked thinner and paler than he had in the Iris-messages. I
                        wondered if
                        he’d eaten in the last week. His black clothes were dusty from traveling in the Labyrinth, and
                        his dark eyes
                        were full of hate. He was too young to look so angry. I still remembered him as the cheerful
                        little kid who
                        played with Mythomagic cards. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Reluctantly, he sheathed his sword. “If you come near me, Percy, I’ll summon
                        help. You don’t
                        want to meet my helpers, I promise.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I believe you,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon patted Nico’s shoulder. “There, we’ve all made nice. Now come along,
                        folks. I want to
                        give you a tour of the ranch.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon had a trolley thing—like one of those kiddie trains that take you around
                        zoos. It was
                        painted black and white in a cowhide pattern. The driver’s car had a set of longhorns stuck to
                        the hood, and the
                        horn sounded like a cowbell. I figured maybe this was how he tortured people. He embarrassed
                        them to death
                        riding around in the moo-mobile. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico sat in the very back, probably so he could keep an eye on us. Eurytion
                        crawled in next to
                        him with his spiked club and pulled his cowboy hat over his eyes like he was going to take a
                        nap. Orthus jumped
                        in the front seat next to Geryon and began barking happily in two-part harmony. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth, Tyson, Grover, and I took the middle two cars. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We have a huge operation!” Geryon boasted as the moo-mobile lurched forward.
                        “Horses and
                        cattle mostly, but all sorts of exotic varieties, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We came over a hill, and Annabeth gasped. “Hippalektryons? I thought they were
                        extinct!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the bottom of the hill was a fenced-in pasture with a dozen of the weirdest
                        animals I’d ever
                        seen. Each had the front half of a horse and the back half of a rooster. Their rear feet were
                        huge yellow claws.
                        They had feathery tails and red wings. As I watched, two of them got in a fight over a pile of
                        seed. They reared
                        up on their back legs and whinnied and flapped their wings at each other until the smaller one
                        galloped away,
                        its rear bird legs putting a little hop in its step. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Rooster ponies,” Tyson said in amazement. “Do they lay eggs?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Once a year!” Geryon grinned in the rearview mirror. “Very much in demand for
                        omelettes!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s horrible!” Annabeth said. “They must be an endangered species!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon waved his hand. “Gold is gold, darling. And you haven’t tasted the
                        omelettes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s not right,” Grover murmured, but Geryon just kept narrating the tour.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now, over here,” he said, “we have our fire-breathing horses, which you may
                        have seen on your
                        way in. They’re bred for war, naturally.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What war?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon grinned slyly. “Oh, whichever one comes along. And over yonder, of
                        course, are our prize
                        red cows.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Sure enough, hundreds of the cherry-colored cattle were grazing the side of a
                        hill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So many,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, well, Apollo is too busy to see to them,” Geryon explained, “so he
                        subcontracts to us. We
                        breed them vigorously because there’s such a demand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“For what?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon raised an eyebrow. “Meat, of course! Armies have to eat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You kill the sacred cows of the sun god for hamburger meat?” Grover said.
                        “That’s against the
                        ancient laws!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, don’t get so worked up, satyr. They’re just animals.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just animals!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, and if Apollo cared, I’m sure he would tell us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If he knew,” I muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico sat forward. “I don’t care about any of this, Geryon. We had business to
                        discuss, and this
                        wasn’t it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All in good time, Mr. di Angelo. Look over here; some of my exotic game.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The next field was ringed in barbed wire. The whole area was crawling with
                        giant scorpions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Triple G Ranch,” I said, suddenly remembering. “Your mark was on the crates at
                        camp. Quintus
                        got his scorpions from you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Quintus…” Geryon mused. “Short gray hair, muscular, swordsman?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Never heard of him,” Geryon said. “Now, over here are my prize stables! You
                        must see them.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t need to see them, because as soon as we got within three hundred yards
                        I started to
                        smell them. Near the banks of a green river was a horse corral the size of a football field.
                        Stables lined one
                        side of it. About a hundred horses were milling around in the muck—and when I say muck, I mean
                        horse poop. It
                        was the most disgusting thing I’d ever seen, like a poop blizzard had come through and dumped
                        four feet of the
                        stuff overnight. The horses were really gross from wading through it, and the stables were just
                        as bad. It
                        reeked like you would not believe—worse than the garbage boats on the East River. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Even Nico gagged. “What <i class="calibre5">is </i>that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My stables!” Geryon said. “Well, actually they belong to Aegeas, but we watch
                        over them for a
                        small monthly fee. Aren’t they lovely?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They’re disgusting!” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Lots of poop,” Tyson observed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How can you keep animals like that?” Grover cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Y’all gettin’ on my nerves,” Geryon said. “These are flesh-eating horses, see?
                        They like these
                        conditions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Plus, you’re too cheap to have them cleaned,” Eurytion mumbled from under his
                        hat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Quiet!” Geryon snapped. “All right, perhaps the stables are a bit challenging
                        to clean.
                        Perhaps they do make me nauseous when the wind blows the wrong way. But so what? My clients
                        still pay me well.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What clients?” I demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, you’d be surprised how many people will pay for a flesh-eating horse. They
                        make great
                        garbage disposals. Wonderful way to terrify your enemies. Great at birthday parties! We rent
                        them out all the
                        time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re a monster,” Annabeth decided. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon stopped the moo-mobile and turned to look at her. “What gave it away?
                        Was it the three
                        bodies?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You have to let these animals go,” Grover said. “It’s not right!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And the clients you keep talking about,” Annabeth said. “You work for Kronos,
                        don’t you?
                        You’re supplying his army with horses, food, whatever they need.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon shrugged, which was very weird since he had three sets of shoulders. It
                        looked like he
                        was doing the wave all by himself. “I work for anyone with gold, young lady. I’m a businessman.
                        And I sell them
                        anything I have to offer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He climbed out of the moo-mobile and strolled toward the stables as if enjoying
                        the fresh air.
                        It would’ve been a nice view, with the river and the trees and hills and all, except for the
                        quagmire of horse
                        muck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico got out of the back car and stormed over to Geryon. The cowherd Eurytion
                        wasn’t as sleepy
                        as he looked. He hefted his club and walked after Nico. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I came here for business, Geryon,” Nico said. “And you haven’t answered me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mmm.” Geryon examined a cactus. His left arm reached over and scratched his
                        middle chest.
                        “Yes, you’ll get a deal, all right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My ghost told me you could help. He said you could guide us to the soul we
                        need.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait a second,” I said. “I thought <i class="calibre5">I </i>was the soul you
                        wanted.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico looked at me like I was crazy. “You? Why would I want you? Bianca’s soul
                        is worth a
                        thousand of yours! Now, can you help me, Geryon, or not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, I imagine I could,” the rancher said. “Your ghost friend, by the way,
                        where is he?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico looked uneasy. “He can’t form in broad daylight. It’s hard for him. But
                        he’s around
                        somewhere.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon smiled. “I’m sure. Minos likes to disappear when things get…difficult.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">“Minos?” </i>I remembered the man I’d seen in my dreams,
                        with the golden
                        crown, the pointed beard, and the cruel eyes. “You mean that evil king? <i
                            class="calibre5">That’s </i>the ghost
                        who’s been giving you advice?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s none of your business, Percy!” Nico turned back to Geryon. “And what do
                        you mean about
                        things getting difficult?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The three-bodied man sighed. “Well you see, Nico— can I call you Nico?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You see, Nico, Luke Castellan is offering very good money for half-bloods.
                        Especially powerful
                        half-bloods. And I’m sure when he learns your little secret, who you really are, he’ll pay very,
                        very well
                        indeed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico drew his sword, but Eurytion knocked it out of his hand. Before I could
                        get up, Orthus
                        pounced on my chest and growled, his faces an inch away from mine. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/8-15.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I would stay in the car, all of you,” Geryon warned. “Or Orthus will tear Mr.
                        Jackson’s throat
                        out. Now, Eurytion, if would be so kind, secure Nico.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The cowherd spit into the grass. “Do I have to?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, you fool!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion looked bored, but he wrapped one huge arm around Nico and lifted him
                        up like a
                        wrestler. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Pick up the sword, too,” Geryon said with distaste. “There’s nothing I hate
                        worse than Stygian
                        iron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion picked up the sword, careful not to touch the blade. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now,” Geryon said cheerfully, “we’ve had the tour. Let’s go back to the lodge,
                        have some
                        lunch, and send an Iris-message to our friends in the Titan army.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You fiend!” Annabeth cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon smiled at her. “Don’t worry, my dear. Once I’ve delivered Mr. di Angelo,
                        you and your
                        party can go. I don’t interfere with quests. Besides, I’ve been paid well to give you safe
                        passage, which does
                        not, I’m afraid, include Mr. di Angelo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Paid by whom?” Annabeth said. “What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Never you mind, darlin’. Let’s be off, shall we?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait!” I said, and Orthus growled. I stayed perfectly still so he wouldn’t
                        tear my throat out.
                        “Geryon, you said you’re a businessman. Make me a deal.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon narrowed his eyes. “What sort of deal? Do you have gold?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve got something better. Barter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But Mr. Jackson, you’ve got nothing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You could have him clean the stables,” Eurytion suggested innocently. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll do it!” I said. “If I fail, you get all of us. Trade us all to Luke for
                        gold.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Assuming the horses don’t eat you,” Geryon observed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Either way, you get my friends,” I said. “But if I succeed, you’ve got to let
                        all of us go,
                        including Nico.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” Nico screamed. “Don’t do me any favors, Percy. I don’t want your help!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon chuckled. “Percy Jackson, those stables haven’t been cleaned in a
                        thousand years…though
                        it’s true I might be able to sell more stable space if all that poop was cleared away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So what have you got to lose?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The rancher hesitated. “All right, I’ll accept your offer, but you have to get
                        it done by
                        sunset. If you fail, your friends get sold, and I get rich.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Deal.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He nodded. “I’m going to take your friends with me, back to the lodge. We’ll
                        wait for you
                        there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion gave me a funny look. It might have been sympathy. He whistled, and
                        the dog jumped off
                        me and onto Annabeth’s lap. She yelped. I knew Tyson and Grover would never try anything as long
                        as Annabeth was
                        a hostage. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got out of the car and locked eyes with her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I hope you know what you’re doing,” she said quietly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I hope so, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon got behind the driver’s wheel. Eurytion hauled Nico into the backseat.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sunset,” Geryon reminded me. “No later.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He laughed at me once more, sounded his cowbell horn, and the moo-mobile
                        rumbled off down the
                        trail. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">As I got closer to the fence I held my shirt over my nose to block the smell.
                        One stallion
                        waded through the muck and whinnied angrily at me. He bared his teeth, which were pointed like a
                        bear’s. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to talk to him in my mind. I can do that with most horses. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Hi</i>, I told him. <i class="calibre5">I’m going to clean

                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Seafood! </i>The other horses chimed in as they waded
                        through the field.
                        Flies were buzzing everywhere, and the heat of the day didn’t make the smell any better. I’d had
                        some idea that
                        I could do this challenge, because I remembered how Hercules had done it. He’d channeled a river
                        into the
                        stables and cleaned them out that way. I figured I could maybe control the water. But if I
                        couldn’t get close to
                        the horses without getting eaten, that was a problem. And the river was downhill from the
                        stables, a lot farther
                        away than I’d realized, almost half a mile. The problem of the poop looked a lot bigger up
                        close. I picked up a
                        rusted shovel and experimentally scooped some away from the fence line. Great. Only four billion
                        shovelfuls to
                        go. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The sun was already sinking. I had a few hours at best. I decided the river was
                        my only hope.
                        At least it would be easier to think at the riverside than it was here. I set off downhill. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">When I got to the river, I found a girl waiting for me. She was wearing jeans
                        and a green
                        T-shirt and her long brown hair was braided with river grass. She had a stern look on her face.
                        Her arms were
                        crossed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh no you don’t,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at her. “Are you a naiad?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She rolled her eyes. “Of course!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But you speak English. And you’re out of the water.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What, you don’t think we can act human if we want to?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d never thought about it. I kind of felt stupid, though, because I’d seen
                        plenty of naiads at
                        camp, and they’d never done much more than giggle and wave at me from the bottom of the canoe
                        lake. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look,” I said, “I just came to ask—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know who you are,” she said. “And I know what you want. And the answer is
                        no! I’m not to
                        going have my river used again to clean that filthy stable.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, save it, sea boy. You ocean-god types always think you’re soooo much more
                        important than
                        some little river, don’t you? Well let me tell you, <i class="calibre5">this </i>naiad is not
                        going to be pushed
                        around just because your daddy is Poseidon. This is freshwater territory, mister. The last guy
                        who asked me this
                        favor—oh, he was way better-looking than you, by the way—he convinced me, and that was the worst
                        mistake I’ve
                        ever made! Do you have any idea what all that horse manure does to my ecosystem? Do I look like
                        a sewage
                        treatment plant to you? My fish will die. I’ll <i class="calibre5">never </i>get the muck out of
                        my plants. I’ll
                        be sick for years. NO THANK YOU!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The way she talked reminded me of my mortal friend, Rachel Elizabeth Dare—kind
                        of like she was
                        punching me with words. I couldn’t blame the naiad. Now that I thought about it, I’d be pretty
                        mad if somebody
                        dumped four million pounds of manure in my home. But still…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My friends are in danger,” I told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, that’s too bad! But it’s not my problem. And you’re not going to ruin my
                        river.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked like she was ready for a fight. Her fists were balled, but I thought
                        I heard a
                        little quiver in her voice. Suddenly I realized that despite her angry attitude, she was afraid
                        of me. She
                        probably thought I was going to fight her for control of the river, and she was worried she
                        would lose. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The thought made me sad. I felt like a bully, a son of Poseidon throwing his
                        weight around.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I sat down on a tree stump. “Okay, you win.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The naiad looked surprised. “Really?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m not going to fight you. It’s your river.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She relaxed her shoulders. “Oh. Oh, good. I mean— good thing for you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But my friends and I are going to get sold to the Titans if I don’t clean
                        those stables by
                        sunset. And I don’t know how.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The river gurgled along cheerfully. A snake slid through the water and ducked
                        its head under.
                        Finally the naiad sighed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll tell you a secret, son of the sea god. Scoop up some dirt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You heard me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I crouched down and scooped up a handful of Texas dirt. It was dry and black
                        and spotted with
                        tiny clumps of white rock…No, something besides rock. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Those are shells,” the naiad said. “Petrified seashells. Millions of years
                        ago, even before
                        the time of the gods, when only Gaea and Ouranos reigned, this land was under water. It was part
                        of the sea.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Suddenly I saw what she meant. There were little pieces of ancient sea urchins
                        in my hand,
                        mollusk shells. Even the limestone rocks had impressions of seashells embedded in them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay,” I said. “What good does that do me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re not so different from me, demigod. Even when I’m out of the water, the
                        water is within
                        me. It is my life source.” She stepped back, put her feet in the river, and smiled. “I hope you
                        find a way to
                        rescue your friends.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And with that she turned to liquid and melted into the river. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The sun was touching the hills when I got back to the stables. Somebody must’ve
                        come by and fed
                        the horses, because they were tearing into huge animal carcasses. I couldn’t tell what kind of
                        animal, and I
                        really didn’t want to know. If it was possible for the stables to get more disgusting, fifty
                        horses tearing into
                        raw meat did it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Seafood! </i>one thought when he saw me. <i
                            class="calibre5">Come in! We’re
                            still hungry. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">What was I supposed to do? I couldn’t use the river. And the fact that this
                        place had been
                        under water a million years ago didn’t exactly help me now. I looked at the little calcified
                        seashell in my
                        palm, then at the huge mountain of dung. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Frustrated, I threw the shell into the poop. I was about to turn my back on the
                        horses when I
                        heard a sound. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">PFFFFFFT! </i>Like a balloon with a leak. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked down where I had thrown the shell. A tiny spout of water was shooting
                        out of the muck.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No way,” I muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hesitantly, I stepped toward the fence. “Get bigger,” I told the waterspout.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">SPOOOOOOOSH! </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Water shot three feet into the air and kept bubbling. It was impossible, but
                        there it was. A
                        couple of horses came over to check it out. One put his mouth to the spring and recoiled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Yuck! </i>he said. <i class="calibre5">Salty! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was seawater in the middle of a Texas ranch. I scooped up another handful of
                        dirt and picked
                        out the shell fossils. I didn’t really know what I was doing, but I ran around the length of the
                        stable,
                        throwing shells into the dung piles. Everywhere a shell hit, a saltwater spring erupted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Stop! </i>The horses cried. <i class="calibre5">Meat is
                            good! Baths are
                            bad! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I noticed the water wasn’t running out of the stables or flowing downhill
                        like water
                        normally would. It simply bubbled around each spring and sank into the ground, taking the dung
                        with it. The
                        horse poop dissolved in the saltwater, leaving regular old wet dirt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“More!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a tugging sensation in my gut, and the waterspouts exploded like the
                        world’s largest
                        carwash. Salt water shot twenty feet into the air. The horses went crazy, running back and forth
                        as the geysers
                        sprayed them from all directions. Mountains of poop began to melt like ice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The tugging sensation became more intense, painful even, but there was
                        something exhilarating
                        about seeing all that salt water. I had made this. I had brought the ocean to this hillside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Stop, lord! </i>a horse cried. <i class="calibre5">Stop,
                            please! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Water was sloshing everywhere now. The horses were drenched, and some were
                        panicking and
                        slipping in the mud. The poop was completely gone, tons of it just dissolved into the earth, and
                        the water was
                        now starting to pool, trickling out of the stable, making a hundred little streams down toward
                        the river. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stop,” I told the water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nothing happened. The pain in my gut was building. If I didn’t shut off the
                        geysers soon, the
                        salt water would run into the river and poison the fish and plants. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stop!” I concentrated all my might on shutting off the force of the sea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Suddenly the geysers shut down. I collapsed to my knees, exhausted. In front of
                        me was a shiny
                        clean horse stable, a field of wet salty mud, and fifty horses that had been scoured so
                        thoroughly their coats
                        gleamed. Even the meat scraps between their teeth had been washed out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">We won’t eat you! </i>the horses wailed. <i
                            class="calibre5">Please, lord!
                            No more salty baths! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“On one condition,” I said. “You only eat the food your handlers give you from
                        now on. Not
                        people. Or I’ll be back with more seashells!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The horses whinnied and made me a whole lot of promises that they would be good
                        flesh-eating
                        horses from now on, but I didn’t stick around to chat. The sun was going down. I turned and ran
                        full speed
                        toward the ranch house. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I smelled barbecue before I reached the house, and that made me madder than
                        ever, because I
                        really love barbecue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The deck was set up for a party. Streamers and balloons decorated the railing.
                        Geryon was
                        flipping burgers on a huge barbecue cooker made from an oil drum. Eurytion lounged at a picnic
                        table, picking
                        his fingernails with a knife. The two-headed dog sniffed the ribs and burgers that were frying
                        on the grill. And
                        then I saw my friends: Tyson, Grover, Annabeth, and Nico all tossed in a corner, tied up like
                        rodeo animals,
                        with their ankles and wrists roped together and their mouths gagged. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Let them go!” I yelled, still out of breath from running up the steps. “I
                        cleaned the
                        stables!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon turned. He wore an apron on each chest, with one word on each, so
                        together they spelled
                        out: KISS— THE—CHEF. “Did you, now? How’d you manage it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was pretty impatient, but I told him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He nodded appreciatively. “Very ingenious. It would’ve been better if you’d
                        poisoned that pesky
                        naiad, but no matter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Let my friends go,” I said. “We had a deal.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah, I’ve been thinking about that. The problem is, if I let them go, I don’t
                        get paid.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You promised!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon made a <i class="calibre5">tsk-tsk </i>noise. “But did you make me swear
                        on the River
                        Styx? No you didn’t. So it’s not binding. When you’re conducting business, sonny, you should
                        always get a
                        binding oath.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I drew my sword. Orthus growled. One head leaned down next to Grover’s ear and
                        bared its fangs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Eurytion,” Geryon said, “the boy is starting to annoy me. Kill him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion studied me. I didn’t like my odds against him and that huge club. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Kill him yourself,” Eurytion said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon raised his eyebrows. “Excuse me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You heard me,” Eurytion grumbled. “You keep sending me out to do your dirty
                        work. You pick
                        fights for no good reason, and I’m tired of dying for you. You want to fight the kid, do it
                        yourself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was the most un-Areslike thing I’d ever heard a son of Ares say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon threw down his spatula. “You dare defy me? I should fire you right now!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And who’d take care of your cattle? Orthus, heel.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The dog immediately stopped growling at Grover and came to sit by the cowherd’s
                        feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fine!” Geryon snarled. “I’ll deal with you later, after the boy is dead!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He picked up two carving knives and threw them at me. I deflected one with my
                        sword. The other
                        impaled itself in the picnic table an inch from Eurytion’s hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I went on the attack. Geryon parried my first strike with a pair of red-hot
                        tongs and lunged at
                        my face with a barbecue fork. I got inside his next thrust and stabbed him right through the
                        middle chest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Aghhh!” He crumpled to his knees. I waited for him to disintegrate, the way
                        monsters usually
                        do. But instead he just grimaced and began to stand up. The wound in his chef ’s apron started
                        to heal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nice try, sonny,” he said. “Thing is, I have three hearts. The perfect backup
                        system.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He tipped over the barbecue, and coals spilled everywhere. One landed next to
                        Annabeth’s face,
                        and she let out a muffled scream. Tyson strained against his bonds, but even his strength wasn’t
                        enough to break
                        them. I had to end this fight before my friends got hurt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I jabbed Geryon in left chest, but he only laughed. I stuck him in the right
                        stomach. No good.
                        I might as well have been sticking a sword in a teddy bear for all the reaction he showed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Three hearts. The perfect backup system. Stabbing one at a time was no good….
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I ran into the house. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Coward!” he cried. “Come back and die right!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The living room walls were decorated with a bunch of gruesome hunting
                        trophies—stuffed deer and
                        dragon heads, a gun case, a sword display, and a bow with a quiver. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon threw his barbecue fork, and it thudded into the wall right next to my
                        head. He drew two
                        swords from the wall display. “Your head’s gonna go right there, Jackson! Next to the grizzly
                        bear!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I had a crazy idea. I dropped Riptide and grabbed the bow off the wall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was the worst archery shot in the world. I couldn’t hit the targets at camp,
                        much less a
                        bull’s-eye. But I had no choice. I couldn’t win this fight with a sword. I prayed to Artemis and
                        Apollo, the
                        twin archers, hoping they might take pity on me for once. <i class="calibre5">Please, guys. Just
                            one shot.
                            Please. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I notched an arrow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon laughed. “You fool! One arrow is no better than one sword.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He raised his swords and charged. I dove sideways. Before he could turn, I shot
                        my arrow into
                        the side of his right chest. I heard <i class="calibre5">THUMP, THUMP, THUMP, </i>as the arrow
                        passed clean
                        through each of his chests and flew out his left side, embedding itself in the forehead of the
                        grizzly bear
                        trophy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Geryon dropped his swords. He turned and stared at me. “You can’t shoot. They
                        told me you
                        couldn’t…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His face turned a sickly shade of green. He collapsed to his knees and began
                        crumbling into
                        sand, until all that was left were three cooking aprons and an oversized pair of cowboy boots.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I got my friends untied. Eurytion didn’t try to stop me. Then I stoked up the
                        barbecue and
                        threw the food into the flames as a burnt offering for Artemis and Apollo. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thanks, guys,” I said. “I owe you one.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The sky thundered in the distance, so I figured maybe the burgers smelled okay.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yay for Percy!” Tyson said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Can we tie up this cowherd now?” Nico asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah!” Grover agreed. “And that dog almost killed me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at Eurytion, who still was sitting relaxed at the picnic table. Orthus
                        had both his
                        heads on the cowherd’s knees. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How long will it take Geryon to re-form?” I asked him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion shrugged. “Hundred years? He’s not one of those fast re-formers, thank
                        the gods.
                        You’ve done me a favor.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You said you’d died for him before,” I remembered. “How?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve worked for that creep for thousands of years. Started as a regular
                        half-blood, but I
                        chose immortality when my dad offered it. Worst mistake I ever made. Now I’m stuck here at this
                        ranch. I can’t
                        leave. I can’t quit. I just tend the cows and fight Geryon’s fights. We’re kinda tied together.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe you can change things,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion narrowed his eyes. “How?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Be nice to the animals. Take care of them. Stop selling them for food. And
                        stop dealing with
                        the Titans.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion thought about that. “That’d be all right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Get the animals on your side, and they’ll help you. Once Geryon gets back,
                        maybe he’ll be
                        working for you this time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion grinned. “Now, <i class="calibre5">that </i>I could live with.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You won’t try to stop us leaving?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shoot, no.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth rubbed her bruised wrists. She was still looking at Eurytion
                        suspiciously. “Your boss
                        said that somebody paid for our safe passage. Who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The cowherd shrugged. “Maybe he was just saying that to fool you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What about the Titans?” I asked. “Did you Iris-message them about Nico yet?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nope. Geryon was waiting until after the barbecue. They don’t know anything
                        about him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico was glaring at me. I wasn’t sure what to do about him. I doubted he would
                        agree to come
                        with us. On the other hand, I couldn’t just let him roam around on his own. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You could stay here until we’re done with our quest,” I told him. “It would be
                        safe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">“Safe?” </i>Nico said. “What do you care if I’m safe? You
                        got my sister
                        killed!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nico,” Annabeth said, “that wasn’t Percy’s fault. And Geryon wasn’t lying
                        about Kronos wanting
                        to capture you. If he knew who you were, he’d do anything to get you on his side.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m not on anyone’s side. And I’m not afraid!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You should be,” Annabeth said. “Your sister wouldn’t want—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If you cared for my sister, you’d help me bring her back!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A soul for a soul?” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But if you didn’t want my soul—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m not explaining anything to you!” He blinked tears out of his eyes. “And I
                        <i class="calibre5">will </i>bring her back.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Bianca wouldn’t want to be brought back,” I said. “Not like that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You didn’t know her!” he shouted. “How do you know what she’d want?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the flames in the barbecue pit. I thought about the line in
                        Annabeth’s prophecy: <i class="calibre5">You shall rise or fall by the ghost king’s hand.
                        </i>That had to be Minos, and I <i class="calibre5">had </i>to convince Nico not to listen to
                        him. “Let’s ask Bianca.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The sky seemed to grow darker all of the sudden. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve tried,” Nico’s said miserably. “She won’t answer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Try again. I’ve got a feeling she’ll answer with me here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why would she?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because she’s been sending me Iris-messages,” I said, suddenly sure of it.
                        “She’s been trying
                        to warn me what you’re up to, so I can protect you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico shook his head. “That’s impossible.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“One way to find out. You said you’re not afraid.” I turned to Eurytion. “We’re
                        going to need a
                        pit, like a grave. And food and drinks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Annabeth warned. “I don’t think this is a good—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All right,” Nico said. “I’ll try.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eurytion scratched his beard. “There’s a hole dug out back for a septic tank.
                        We could use
                        that. Cyclops boy, fetch my ice chest from the kitchen. I hope the dead like root beer.” </p>
