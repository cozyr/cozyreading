                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The last thing I wanted to do on my summer break was blow up another school.
                        But there I was
                        Monday morning, the first week of June, sitting in my mom’s car in front of Goode High School on
                        East 81st. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Goode was this big brownstone building overlooking the East River. A bunch of
                        BMWs and Lincoln
                        Town Cars were parked out front. Staring up at the fancy stone archway, I wondered how long it
                        would take me to
                        get kicked out of this place. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just relax.” My mom didn’t sound relaxed. “It’s only an orientation tour. And
                        remember, dear,
                        this is Paul’s school. So try not to…you know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Destroy it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Paul Blofis, my mom’s boyfriend, was standing out front, greeting future ninth
                        graders as they
                        came up the steps. With his salt-and-pepper hair, denim clothes, and leather jacket, he reminded
                        me of a TV
                        actor, but he was just an English teacher. He’d managed to convince Goode High School to accept
                        me for ninth
                        grade, despite the fact that I’d gotten kicked out of every school I’d ever attended. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d tried to warn him it wasn’t a good idea, but he wouldn’t listen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at my mom. “You haven’t told him the truth about me, have you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She tapped her fingers nervously on the wheel. She was dressed up for a job
                        interview—her best
                        blue dress and high-heeled shoes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I thought we should wait,” she admitted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So we don’t scare him away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sure orientation will be fine, Percy. It’s only one morning.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Great,” I mumbled. “I can get expelled before I even start the school year.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Think positive. Tomorrow you’re off to camp! After orientation, you’ve got
                        your date—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s not a date!” I protested. “It’s just Annabeth, Mom. Jeez!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She’s coming all the way from camp to meet you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re going to the movies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just the two of you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She held up her hands in surrender, but I could tell she was trying hard not to
                        smile. “You’d
                        better get inside, dear. I’ll see you tonight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to get out of the car when I looked over at the steps of the
                        school. Paul Blofis
                        was greeting a girl with frizzy red hair. She wore a maroon T-shirt and ratty jeans decorated
                        with marker
                        drawings. When she turned, I caught a glimpse of her face, and the hairs on my arms stood
                        straight up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy?” my mom asked. “What’s wrong?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“N-nothing,” I stammered. “Does the school have a side entrance?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Down the block on the right. Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll see you later.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mom started to say something, but I got out of the car and ran, hoping the
                        redheaded girl
                        wouldn’t see me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">What was <i class="calibre5">she </i>doing here? Not even <i
                            class="calibre5">my </i>luck could
                        be this bad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Yeah, right. I was about to find out my luck could get a whole lot worse. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Sneaking into orientation didn’t work out too well. Two cheerleaders in
                        purple-and-white
                        uniforms were standing at the side entrance, waiting to ambush freshmen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi!” They smiled, which I figured was the first and last time any cheerleaders
                        would be that
                        friendly to me. One was blond with icy blue eyes. The other was African American with dark curly
                        hair like
                        Medusa’s (and believe me, I know what I’m talking about). Both girls had their names stitched in
                        cursive on
                        their uniforms, but with my dyslexia, the words looked like meaningless spaghetti. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Welcome to Goode,” the blond girl said. “You are <i class="calibre5">so
                        </i>going to love it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But as she looked me up and down, her expression said something more like, <i
                            class="calibre5">Eww, who is this loser? </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The other girl stepped uncomfortably close to me. I studied the stitching on
                        her uniform and
                        made out <i class="calibre5">Kelli</i>. She smelled like roses and something else I recognized
                        from riding
                        lessons at camp—the scent of freshly washed horses. It was a weird smell for a cheerleader.
                        Maybe she owned a
                        horse or something. Anyway, she stood so close I got the feeling she was going to try to push me
                        down the steps.
                        “What’s your name, fish?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fish?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Freshman.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The girls exchanged looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Percy Jackson,” the blond one said. “We’ve been waiting for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That sent a major <i class="calibre5">Uh-oh </i>chill down my back. They were
                        blocking the
                        entrance, smiling in a not-very-friendly way. My hand crept instinctively toward my pocket,
                        where I kept my
                        lethal ballpoint pen, Riptide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then another voice came from inside the building: “Percy?” It was Paul Blofis,
                        somewhere down
                        the hallway. I’d never been so glad to hear his voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The cheerleaders backed off. I was so anxious to get past them I accidentally
                        kneed Kelli in
                        the thigh. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clang. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her leg made a hollow, metallic sound, like I’d just hit a flagpole. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ow,” she muttered. “Watch it, <i class="calibre5">fish</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I glanced down, but her leg looked like a regular old leg. I was too freaked
                        out to ask
                        questions. I dashed into the hall, the cheerleaders laughing behind me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There you are!” Paul told me. “Welcome to Goode!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, Paul—uh, Mr. Blofis.” I glanced back, but the weird cheerleaders had
                        disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, uh—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Paul clapped me on the back. “Listen, I know you’re nervous, but don’t worry.
                        We get a lot of
                        kids here with ADHD and dyslexia. The teachers know how to help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I almost wanted to laugh. If only ADHD and dyslexia were my biggest worries. I
                        mean, I knew
                        Paul was trying to help, but if I told him the truth about me, he’d either think I was crazy or
                        he’d run away
                        screaming. Those cheerleaders, for instance. I had a bad feeling about them…. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I looked down the hall, and I remembered I had another problem. The
                        redheaded girl I’d
                        seen on the front steps was just coming in the main entrance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Don’t notice me, </i>I prayed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She noticed me. Her eyes widened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where’s the orientation?” I asked Paul. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The gym. That way. But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Bye.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy?” he called, but I was already running. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought I’d lost her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bunch of kids were heading for the gym, and soon I was just one of three
                        hundred
                        fourteen-year-olds all crammed into the bleachers. A marching band played an out-of-tune fight
                        song that sounded
                        like somebody hitting a bag of cats with a metal baseball bat. Older kids, probably student
                        council members,
                        stood up front modeling the Goode school uniform and looking all, <i class="calibre5">Hey, we’re
                            cool</i>.
                        Teachers milled around, smiling and shaking hands with students. The walls of the gym were
                        plastered with big
                        purple-and-white banners that said WELCOME FUTURE FRESHMEN, GOODE IS GOOD, WE’RE ALL FAMILY, and
                        a bunch of
                        other happy slogans that pretty much made me want to throw up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">None of the other freshmen looked thrilled to be here, either. I mean, coming
                        to orientation in
                        June, when school doesn’t even start until September, is not cool. But at Goode, “We prepare to
                        excel early!” At
                        least that’s what the brochure said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The marching band stopped playing. A guy in a pinstripe suit came to the
                        microphone and started
                        talking, but the sound echoed around the gym so I had no idea what he was saying. He might’ve
                        been gargling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Someone grabbed my shoulder. “What are you doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was her: my redheaded nightmare. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Rachel Elizabeth Dare,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her jaw dropped like she couldn’t believe I had the nerve to remember her name.
                        “And you’re
                        Percy somebody. I didn’t get your full name last December when you tried to <i
                            class="calibre5">kill </i>me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, I wasn’t—I didn’t—What are <i class="calibre5">you </i>doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Same as you, I guess. Orientation.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You live in New York?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What, you thought I lived at Hoover Dam?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It had never occurred to me. Whenever I thought about her (and I’m <i
                            class="calibre5">not
                        </i>saying I <i class="calibre5">thought </i>about her; she just like crossed my mind from time
                        to time, okay?),
                        I always figured she lived in the Hoover Dam area, since that’s where I’d met her. We’d spent
                        maybe ten minutes
                        together, during which time I’d accidentally swung a sword at her, she’d saved my life, and I’d
                        run away chased
                        by a band of supernatural killing machines. You know, your typical chance meeting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Some guy behind us whispered, “Hey, shut up. The cheerleaders are talking!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi, guys!” a girl bubbled into the microphone. It was the blonde I’d seen at
                        the entrance. “My
                        name is Tammi, and this is, like, Kelli.” Kelli did a cartwheel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Next to me, Rachel yelped like someone had stuck her with a pin. A few kids
                        looked over and
                        snickered, but Rachel just stared at the cheerleaders in horror. Tammi didn’t seem to notice the
                        outburst. She
                        started talking about all the great ways we could get involved during our freshman year. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Run,” Rachel told me. “Now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Rachel didn’t explain. She pushed her way to the edge of the bleachers,
                        ignoring the frowning
                        teachers and grumbling kids she was stepping on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hesitated. Tammi was explaining how we were about to break into small groups
                        and tour the
                        school. Kelli caught my eye and gave me an amused smile, like she was waiting to see what I’d
                        do. It would look
                        bad if I left right now. Paul Blofis was down there with the rest of the teachers. He’d wonder
                        what was wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I thought about Rachel Elizabeth Dare, and the special ability she’d shown
                        last winter at
                        Hoover Dam. She’d been able to see a group of security guards who weren’t guards at all, who
                        weren’t even human.
                        My heart pounding, I got up and followed her out of the gym. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I found Rachel in the band room. She was hiding behind a bass drum in the
                        percussion section.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Get over here!” she said. “Keep your head down!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt pretty silly hiding behind a bunch of bongos, but I crouched beside her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Did they follow you?” Rachel asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean the cheerleaders?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She nodded nervously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t think so,” I said. “What are they? What did you see?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her green eyes were bright with fear. She had a sprinkle of freckles on her
                        face that reminded
                        me of constellations. Her maroon T-shirt read HARVARD ART DEPT. “You…you wouldn’t believe me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, yeah, I would,” I promised. “I know you can see through the Mist.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Mist. It’s…well, it’s like this veil that hides the way things really are.
                        Some mortals
                        are born with the ability to see through it. Like you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She studied me carefully. “You did that at Hoover Dam. You called me a mortal.
                        Like you’re
                        not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt like punching a bongo. What was I thinking? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could never explain. I shouldn’t even try. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tell me,” she begged. “You know what it means. All these horrible things I
                        see?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, this is going to sound weird. Do you know anything about Greek myths?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Like…the Minotaur and the Hydra?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, just try not to say those names when I’m around, okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And the Furies,” she said, warming up. “And the Sirens, and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay!” I looked around the band hall, sure that Rachel was going to make a
                        bunch of
                        bloodthirsty nasties pop out of the walls; but we were still alone. Down the hallway, I heard a
                        mob of kids
                        coming out of the gymnasium. They were starting the group tours. We didn’t have long to talk.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All those monsters,” I said, “all the Greek gods— they’re real.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I knew it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I would’ve been more comfortable if she’d called me a liar, but Rachel looked
                        like I’d just
                        confirmed her worst suspicion. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You don’t know how hard it’s been,” she said. “For years I thought I was going
                        crazy. I
                        couldn’t tell anybody. I couldn’t—” Her eyes narrowed. “Wait. Who are you? I mean <i
                            class="calibre5">really</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m not a monster.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, I know that. I could <i class="calibre5">see </i>if you were. You look
                        like…you. But
                        you’re not human, are you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I swallowed. Even though I’d had three years to get used to who I was, I’d
                        never talked about
                        it with a regular mortal before—I mean, except for my mom, but she already knew. I don’t know
                        why, but I took
                        the plunge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m a half-blood,” I said. “I’m half human.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And half what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Just then Tammi and Kelli stepped into the band room. The doors slammed shut
                        behind them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There you are, Percy Jackson,” Tammi said. “It’s time for your orientation.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“They’re horrible!” Rachel gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tammi and Kelli were still wearing their purple-and-white cheerleader costumes,
                        holding
                        pom-poms from the rally. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do they really look like?” I asked, but Rachel seemed too stunned to
                        answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, forget her.” Tammi gave me a brilliant smile and started walking toward
                        us. Kelli stayed
                        by the doors, blocking our exit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They’d trapped us. I knew we’d have to fight our way out, but Tammi’s smile was
                        so dazzling it
                        distracted me. Her blue eyes were beautiful, and the way her hair swept over her shoulders…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Rachel warned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said something really intelligent like, “Uhhh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tammi was getting closer. She held out her pom-poms. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Rachel’s voice seemed to be coming from a long way away. “Snap out of
                        it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It took all my willpower, but I got my pen out of my pocket and uncapped it.
                        Riptide grew into
                        a three-foot-long bronze sword, its blade glowing with a faint golden light. Tammi’s smile
                        turned to a sneer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, come on,” she protested. “You don’t need that. How about a kiss instead?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She smelled like roses and clean animal fur—a weird but somehow intoxicating
                        smell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Rachel pinched my arm, hard. “Percy, she wants to bite you! Look at her!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She’s just jealous.” Tammi looked back at Kelli. “May I, mistress?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kelli was still blocking the door, licking her lips hungrily. “Go ahead, Tammi.
                        You’re doing
                        fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tammi took another step forward, but I leveled the tip of my sword at her
                        chest. “Get back.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She snarled. “Freshmen,” she said with disgust. “This is <i
                            class="calibre5">our </i>school,
                        half-blood. We feed on whom we choose!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she began to change. The color drained out of her face and arms. Her skin
                        turned as white
                        as chalk, her eyes completely red. Her teeth grew into fangs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A vampire!” I stammered. Then I noticed her legs. Below the cheerleader skirt,
                        her left leg
                        was brown and shaggy with a donkey’s hoof. Her right leg was shaped like a human leg, but it was
                        made of bronze.
                        “Uhh, a vampire with—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t mention the legs!” Tammi snapped. “It’s rude to make fun!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She advanced on her weird, mismatched legs. She looked totally bizarre,
                        especially with the
                        pom-poms, but I couldn’t laugh—not facing those red eyes and sharp fangs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A vampire, you say?” Kelli laughed. “That silly legend was based on <i
                            class="calibre5">us</i>, you fool. We are <i class="calibre5">empousai</i>, servants of
                        Hecate.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mmmm.” Tammi edged closer to me. “Dark magic formed us from animal, bronze,
                        and ghost! We
                        exist to feed on the blood of young men. Now come, give me that kiss!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She bared her fangs. I was so paralyzed I couldn’t move, but Rachel threw a
                        snare drum at the
                        <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>’s head.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The demon hissed and batted the drum away. It went rolling along the aisles
                        between music
                        stands, its springs rattling against the drumhead. Rachel threw a xylophone, but the demon just
                        swatted that
                        away, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t usually kill girls,” Tammi growled. “But for you, mortal, I’ll make an
                        exception. Your
                        eyesight is a little <i class="calibre5">too </i>good!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She lunged at Rachel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” I slashed with Riptide. Tammi tried to dodge my blade, but I sliced
                        straight through her
                        cheerleader uniform, and with a horrible wail she exploded into dust all over Rachel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Rachel coughed. She looked like she’d just had a sack of flour dumped on her
                        head. “Gross!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Monsters do that,” I said. “Sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You killed my trainee!” Kelli yelled. “You need a lesson in school spirit,
                        half-blood!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she too began to change. Her wiry hair turned to flickering flames. Her
                        eyes turned red.
                        She grew fangs. She loped toward us, her brass foot and hoof clopping unevenly on the band-room
                        floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I am senior <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>,” she growled. “No hero has bested
                        me in a
                        thousand years.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah?” I said. “Then you’re overdue!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kelli was a lot faster than Tammi. She dodged my first strike and rolled into
                        the brass
                        section, knocking over a row of trombones with a mighty crash. Rachel scrambled out of the way.
                        I put myself
                        between her and the <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>. Kelli circled us, her eyes going from me to
                        the sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Such a pretty little blade,” she said. “What a shame it stands between us.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her form shimmered—sometimes a demon, sometimes a pretty cheerleader. I tried
                        to keep my mind
                        focused, but it was really distracting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Poor dear.” Kelli chuckled. “You don’t even know what’s happening, do you?
                        Soon, your pretty
                        little camp in flames, your friends made slaves to the Lord of Time, and there’s nothing you can
                        do to stop it.
                        It would be merciful to end your life now, before you have to see that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">From down the hall, I heard voices. A tour group was approaching. A man was
                        saying something
                        about locker combinations. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>’s eyes lit up. “Excellent! We’re about to
                        have company!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She picked up a tuba and threw it at me. Rachel and I ducked. The tuba sailed
                        over our heads
                        and crashed through the window. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The voices in the hall died down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Kelli shouted, pretending to be scared, “why did you throw that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was too surprised to answer. Kelli picked up a music stand and swiped a row
                        of clarinets and
                        flutes. Chairs and musical instruments crashed to the floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stop it!” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">People were tromping down the hall now, coming in our direction. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Time to greet our visitors!” Kelli bared her fangs and ran for the doors. I
                        charged after her
                        with Riptide. I had to stop her from hurting the mortals. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, don’t!” Rachel shouted. But I hadn’t realized what Kelli was up to
                        until it was too
                        late. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kelli flung open the doors. Paul Blofis and a bunch of freshmen stepped back in
                        shock. I raised
                        my sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the last second, the <i class="calibre5">empousa </i>turned toward me like a
                        cowering
                        victim. “Oh no, please!” she cried. I couldn’t stop my blade. It was already in motion. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Just before the celestial bronze hit her, Kelli exploded into flames like a
                        Molotov cocktail.
                        Waves of fire splashed over everything. I’d never seen a monster do that before, but I didn’t
                        have time to
                        wonder about it. I backed into the band room as flames engulfed the doorway. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy?” Paul Blofis looked completely stunned, staring at me from across the
                        fire. “What have
                        you done?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kids screamed and ran down the hall. The fire alarm wailed. Ceiling sprinklers
                        hissed to life.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the chaos, Rachel tugged on my sleeve. “You have to get out of here!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was right. The school was in flames and I’d be held responsible. Mortals
                        couldn’t see
                        through the Mist properly. To them it would look like I’d just attacked a helpless cheerleader
                        in front of a
                        group of witnesses. There was no way I could explain it. I turned from Paul and sprinted for the
                        broken band
                        room window. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I burst out of the alley onto East 81st and ran straight into Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, you’re out early!” She laughed, grabbing my shoulders to keep me from
                        tumbling into the
                        street. “Watch where you’re going, Seaweed Brain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a split second she was in a good mood and everything was fine. She was
                        wearing jeans and an
                        orange camp T-shirt and her clay bead necklace. Her blond hair was pulled back in a ponytail.
                        Her gray eyes
                        sparkled. She looked like she was ready to catch a movie, have a cool afternoon hanging out
                        together. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then Rachel Elizabeth Dare, still covered in monster dust, came charging out of
                        the alley,
                        yelling, “Percy, wait up!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s smile melted. She stared at Rachel, then at the school. For the
                        first time, she
                        seemed to notice the black smoke and the ringing fire alarms. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She frowned at me. “What did you do this time? And who is this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Rachel—Annabeth. Annabeth—Rachel. Um, she’s a friend. I guess.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t sure what else to call Rachel. I mean, I barely knew her, but after
                        being in two
                        life-or-death situations together, I couldn’t just call her nobody. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi,” Rachel said. Then she turned to me. “You are in <i class="calibre5">so
                        </i>much trouble.
                        And you still owe me an explanation!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Police sirens wailed on FDR Drive. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Annabeth said coldly. “We should go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I want to know more about half-bloods,” Rachel insisted. “And monsters. And
                        this stuff about
                        the gods.” She grabbed my arm, whipped out a permanent marker, and wrote a phone number on my
                        hand. “You’re
                        going to call me and explain, okay? You owe me that. Now get going.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll make up some story,” Rachel said. “I’ll tell them it wasn’t your fault.
                        Just go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She ran back toward the school, leaving Annabeth and me in the street. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stared at me for a second. Then she turned and took off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” I jogged after her. “There were these two <i
                            class="calibre5">empou</i><i class="calibre5">sai</i>,” I tried to explain. “They were
                        cheerleaders, see, and they said camp was going to
                        burn, and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You told a mortal girl about half-bloods?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She can see through the Mist. She saw the monsters before I did.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So you told her the truth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She recognized me from Hoover Dam, so—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve met her <i class="calibre5">before</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um, last winter. But seriously, I barely know her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She’s kind of cute.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I never thought about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth kept walking toward York Avenue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll deal with the school,” I promised, anxious to change the subject.
                        “Honest, it’ll be
                        fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth wouldn’t even look at me. “I guess our afternoon is off. We should get
                        you out of
                        here, now that the police will be searching for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind us, smoke billowed up from Goode High School. In the dark column of
                        ashes, I thought I
                        could almost see a face—a she-demon with red eyes, laughing at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Your pretty little camp in flames</i>, Kelli had said. <i
                            class="calibre5">Your friends made slaves to the Lord of Time</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re right,” I told Annabeth, my heart sinking. “We have to get to Camp
                        Half-Blood. <i class="calibre5">Now</i>.” </p>
