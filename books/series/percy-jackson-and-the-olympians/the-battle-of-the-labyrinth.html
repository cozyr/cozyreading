                    <p class="calibre13">The last thing I wanted to do on my summer break was blow up another school.
                        But there I was
                        Monday morning, the first week of June, sitting in my mom’s car in front of Goode High School on
                        East 81st. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Goode was this big brownstone building overlooking the East River. A bunch of
                        BMWs and Lincoln
                        Town Cars were parked out front. Staring up at the fancy stone archway, I wondered how long it
                        would take me to
                        get kicked out of this place. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just relax.” My mom didn’t sound relaxed. “It’s only an orientation tour. And
                        remember, dear,
                        this is Paul’s school. So try not to…you know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Destroy it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Paul Blofis, my mom’s boyfriend, was standing out front, greeting future ninth
                        graders as they
                        came up the steps. With his salt-and-pepper hair, denim clothes, and leather jacket, he reminded
                        me of a TV
                        actor, but he was just an English teacher. He’d managed to convince Goode High School to accept
                        me for ninth
                        grade, despite the fact that I’d gotten kicked out of every school I’d ever attended. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d tried to warn him it wasn’t a good idea, but he wouldn’t listen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at my mom. “You haven’t told him the truth about me, have you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She tapped her fingers nervously on the wheel. She was dressed up for a job
                        interview—her best
                        blue dress and high-heeled shoes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I thought we should wait,” she admitted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So we don’t scare him away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sure orientation will be fine, Percy. It’s only one morning.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Great,” I mumbled. “I can get expelled before I even start the school year.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Think positive. Tomorrow you’re off to camp! After orientation, you’ve got
                        your date—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s not a date!” I protested. “It’s just Annabeth, Mom. Jeez!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She’s coming all the way from camp to meet you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re going to the movies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just the two of you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She held up her hands in surrender, but I could tell she was trying hard not to
                        smile. “You’d
                        better get inside, dear. I’ll see you tonight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to get out of the car when I looked over at the steps of the
                        school. Paul Blofis
                        was greeting a girl with frizzy red hair. She wore a maroon T-shirt and ratty jeans decorated
                        with marker
                        drawings. When she turned, I caught a glimpse of her face, and the hairs on my arms stood
                        straight up. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy?” my mom asked. “What’s wrong?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“N-nothing,” I stammered. “Does the school have a side entrance?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Down the block on the right. Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll see you later.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mom started to say something, but I got out of the car and ran, hoping the
                        redheaded girl
                        wouldn’t see me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">What was <i class="calibre5">she </i>doing here? Not even <i
                            class="calibre5">my </i>luck could
                        be this bad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Yeah, right. I was about to find out my luck could get a whole lot worse. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Sneaking into orientation didn’t work out too well. Two cheerleaders in
                        purple-and-white
                        uniforms were standing at the side entrance, waiting to ambush freshmen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi!” They smiled, which I figured was the first and last time any cheerleaders
                        would be that
                        friendly to me. One was blond with icy blue eyes. The other was African American with dark curly
                        hair like
                        Medusa’s (and believe me, I know what I’m talking about). Both girls had their names stitched in
                        cursive on
                        their uniforms, but with my dyslexia, the words looked like meaningless spaghetti. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Welcome to Goode,” the blond girl said. “You are <i class="calibre5">so
                        </i>going to love it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But as she looked me up and down, her expression said something more like, <i
                            class="calibre5">Eww, who is this loser? </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The other girl stepped uncomfortably close to me. I studied the stitching on
                        her uniform and
                        made out <i class="calibre5">Kelli</i>. She smelled like roses and something else I recognized
                        from riding
                        lessons at camp—the scent of freshly washed horses. It was a weird smell for a cheerleader.
                        Maybe she owned a
                        horse or something. Anyway, she stood so close I got the feeling she was going to try to push me
                        down the steps.
                        “What’s your name, fish?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fish?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Freshman.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The girls exchanged looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Percy Jackson,” the blond one said. “We’ve been waiting for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That sent a major <i class="calibre5">Uh-oh </i>chill down my back. They were
                        blocking the
                        entrance, smiling in a not-very-friendly way. My hand crept instinctively toward my pocket,
                        where I kept my
                        lethal ballpoint pen, Riptide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then another voice came from inside the building: “Percy?” It was Paul Blofis,
                        somewhere down
                        the hallway. I’d never been so glad to hear his voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The cheerleaders backed off. I was so anxious to get past them I accidentally
                        kneed Kelli in
                        the thigh. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clang. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her leg made a hollow, metallic sound, like I’d just hit a flagpole. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ow,” she muttered. “Watch it, <i class="calibre5">fish</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I glanced down, but her leg looked like a regular old leg. I was too freaked
                        out to ask
                        questions. I dashed into the hall, the cheerleaders laughing behind me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There you are!” Paul told me. “Welcome to Goode!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, Paul—uh, Mr. Blofis.” I glanced back, but the weird cheerleaders had
                        disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, uh—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Paul clapped me on the back. “Listen, I know you’re nervous, but don’t worry.
                        We get a lot of
                        kids here with ADHD and dyslexia. The teachers know how to help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I almost wanted to laugh. If only ADHD and dyslexia were my biggest worries. I
                        mean, I knew
                        Paul was trying to help, but if I told him the truth about me, he’d either think I was crazy or
                        he’d run away
                        screaming. Those cheerleaders, for instance. I had a bad feeling about them…. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I looked down the hall, and I remembered I had another problem. The
                        redheaded girl I’d
                        seen on the front steps was just coming in the main entrance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Don’t notice me, </i>I prayed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She noticed me. Her eyes widened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where’s the orientation?” I asked Paul. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The gym. That way. But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Bye.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy?” he called, but I was already running. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought I’d lost her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bunch of kids were heading for the gym, and soon I was just one of three
                        hundred
                        fourteen-year-olds all crammed into the bleachers. A marching band played an out-of-tune fight
                        song that sounded
                        like somebody hitting a bag of cats with a metal baseball bat. Older kids, probably student
                        council members,
                        stood up front modeling the Goode school uniform and looking all, <i class="calibre5">Hey, we’re
                            cool</i>.
                        Teachers milled around, smiling and shaking hands with students. The walls of the gym were
                        plastered with big
                        purple-and-white banners that said WELCOME FUTURE FRESHMEN, GOODE IS GOOD, WE’RE ALL FAMILY, and
                        a bunch of
                        other happy slogans that pretty much made me want to throw up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">None of the other freshmen looked thrilled to be here, either. I mean, coming
                        to orientation in
                        June, when school doesn’t even start until September, is not cool. But at Goode, “We prepare to
                        excel early!” At
                        least that’s what the brochure said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The marching band stopped playing. A guy in a pinstripe suit came to the
                        microphone and started
                        talking, but the sound echoed around the gym so I had no idea what he was saying. He might’ve
                        been gargling.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Someone grabbed my shoulder. “What are you doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was her: my redheaded nightmare. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Rachel Elizabeth Dare,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her jaw dropped like she couldn’t believe I had the nerve to remember her name.
                        “And you’re
                        Percy somebody. I didn’t get your full name last December when you tried to <i
                            class="calibre5">kill </i>me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, I wasn’t—I didn’t—What are <i class="calibre5">you </i>doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Same as you, I guess. Orientation.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You live in New York?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What, you thought I lived at Hoover Dam?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It had never occurred to me. Whenever I thought about her (and I’m <i
                            class="calibre5">not
                        </i>saying I <i class="calibre5">thought </i>about her; she just like crossed my mind from time
                        to time, okay?),
                        I always figured she lived in the Hoover Dam area, since that’s where I’d met her. We’d spent
                        maybe ten minutes
                        together, during which time I’d accidentally swung a sword at her, she’d saved my life, and I’d
                        run away chased
                        by a band of supernatural killing machines. You know, your typical chance meeting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Some guy behind us whispered, “Hey, shut up. The cheerleaders are talking!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi, guys!” a girl bubbled into the microphone. It was the blonde I’d seen at
                        the entrance. “My
                        name is Tammi, and this is, like, Kelli.” Kelli did a cartwheel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Next to me, Rachel yelped like someone had stuck her with a pin. A few kids
                        looked over and
                        snickered, but Rachel just stared at the cheerleaders in horror. Tammi didn’t seem to notice the
                        outburst. She
                        started talking about all the great ways we could get involved during our freshman year. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Run,” Rachel told me. “Now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Rachel didn’t explain. She pushed her way to the edge of the bleachers,
                        ignoring the frowning
                        teachers and grumbling kids she was stepping on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hesitated. Tammi was explaining how we were about to break into small groups
                        and tour the
                        school. Kelli caught my eye and gave me an amused smile, like she was waiting to see what I’d
                        do. It would look
                        bad if I left right now. Paul Blofis was down there with the rest of the teachers. He’d wonder
                        what was wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I thought about Rachel Elizabeth Dare, and the special ability she’d shown
                        last winter at
                        Hoover Dam. She’d been able to see a group of security guards who weren’t guards at all, who
                        weren’t even human.
                        My heart pounding, I got up and followed her out of the gym. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I found Rachel in the band room. She was hiding behind a bass drum in the
                        percussion section.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Get over here!” she said. “Keep your head down!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt pretty silly hiding behind a bunch of bongos, but I crouched beside her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Did they follow you?” Rachel asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean the cheerleaders?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She nodded nervously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t think so,” I said. “What are they? What did you see?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her green eyes were bright with fear. She had a sprinkle of freckles on her
                        face that reminded
                        me of constellations. Her maroon T-shirt read HARVARD ART DEPT. “You…you wouldn’t believe me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, yeah, I would,” I promised. “I know you can see through the Mist.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Mist. It’s…well, it’s like this veil that hides the way things really are.
                        Some mortals
                        are born with the ability to see through it. Like you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She studied me carefully. “You did that at Hoover Dam. You called me a mortal.
                        Like you’re
                        not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt like punching a bongo. What was I thinking? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could never explain. I shouldn’t even try. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tell me,” she begged. “You know what it means. All these horrible things I
                        see?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, this is going to sound weird. Do you know anything about Greek myths?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Like…the Minotaur and the Hydra?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, just try not to say those names when I’m around, okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And the Furies,” she said, warming up. “And the Sirens, and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay!” I looked around the band hall, sure that Rachel was going to make a
                        bunch of
                        bloodthirsty nasties pop out of the walls; but we were still alone. Down the hallway, I heard a
                        mob of kids
                        coming out of the gymnasium. They were starting the group tours. We didn’t have long to talk.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All those monsters,” I said, “all the Greek gods— they’re real.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I knew it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I would’ve been more comfortable if she’d called me a liar, but Rachel looked
                        like I’d just
                        confirmed her worst suspicion. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You don’t know how hard it’s been,” she said. “For years I thought I was going
                        crazy. I
                        couldn’t tell anybody. I couldn’t—” Her eyes narrowed. “Wait. Who are you? I mean <i
                            class="calibre5">really</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m not a monster.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, I know that. I could <i class="calibre5">see </i>if you were. You look
                        like…you. But
                        you’re not human, are you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I swallowed. Even though I’d had three years to get used to who I was, I’d
                        never talked about
                        it with a regular mortal before—I mean, except for my mom, but she already knew. I don’t know
                        why, but I took
                        the plunge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m a half-blood,” I said. “I’m half human.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And half what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Just then Tammi and Kelli stepped into the band room. The doors slammed shut
                        behind them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There you are, Percy Jackson,” Tammi said. “It’s time for your orientation.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“They’re horrible!” Rachel gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tammi and Kelli were still wearing their purple-and-white cheerleader costumes,
                        holding
                        pom-poms from the rally. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do they really look like?” I asked, but Rachel seemed too stunned to
                        answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, forget her.” Tammi gave me a brilliant smile and started walking toward
                        us. Kelli stayed
                        by the doors, blocking our exit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They’d trapped us. I knew we’d have to fight our way out, but Tammi’s smile was
                        so dazzling it
                        distracted me. Her blue eyes were beautiful, and the way her hair swept over her shoulders…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Rachel warned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said something really intelligent like, “Uhhh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tammi was getting closer. She held out her pom-poms. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Rachel’s voice seemed to be coming from a long way away. “Snap out of
                        it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It took all my willpower, but I got my pen out of my pocket and uncapped it.
                        Riptide grew into
                        a three-foot-long bronze sword, its blade glowing with a faint golden light. Tammi’s smile
                        turned to a sneer.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, come on,” she protested. “You don’t need that. How about a kiss instead?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She smelled like roses and clean animal fur—a weird but somehow intoxicating
                        smell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Rachel pinched my arm, hard. “Percy, she wants to bite you! Look at her!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She’s just jealous.” Tammi looked back at Kelli. “May I, mistress?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kelli was still blocking the door, licking her lips hungrily. “Go ahead, Tammi.
                        You’re doing
                        fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tammi took another step forward, but I leveled the tip of my sword at her
                        chest. “Get back.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She snarled. “Freshmen,” she said with disgust. “This is <i
                            class="calibre5">our </i>school,
                        half-blood. We feed on whom we choose!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she began to change. The color drained out of her face and arms. Her skin
                        turned as white
                        as chalk, her eyes completely red. Her teeth grew into fangs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A vampire!” I stammered. Then I noticed her legs. Below the cheerleader skirt,
                        her left leg
                        was brown and shaggy with a donkey’s hoof. Her right leg was shaped like a human leg, but it was
                        made of bronze.
                        “Uhh, a vampire with—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t mention the legs!” Tammi snapped. “It’s rude to make fun!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She advanced on her weird, mismatched legs. She looked totally bizarre,
                        especially with the
                        pom-poms, but I couldn’t laugh—not facing those red eyes and sharp fangs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A vampire, you say?” Kelli laughed. “That silly legend was based on <i
                            class="calibre5">us</i>, you fool. We are <i class="calibre5">empousai</i>, servants of
                        Hecate.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mmmm.” Tammi edged closer to me. “Dark magic formed us from animal, bronze,
                        and ghost! We
                        exist to feed on the blood of young men. Now come, give me that kiss!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She bared her fangs. I was so paralyzed I couldn’t move, but Rachel threw a
                        snare drum at the
                        <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>’s head.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The demon hissed and batted the drum away. It went rolling along the aisles
                        between music
                        stands, its springs rattling against the drumhead. Rachel threw a xylophone, but the demon just
                        swatted that
                        away, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t usually kill girls,” Tammi growled. “But for you, mortal, I’ll make an
                        exception. Your
                        eyesight is a little <i class="calibre5">too </i>good!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She lunged at Rachel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” I slashed with Riptide. Tammi tried to dodge my blade, but I sliced
                        straight through her
                        cheerleader uniform, and with a horrible wail she exploded into dust all over Rachel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Rachel coughed. She looked like she’d just had a sack of flour dumped on her
                        head. “Gross!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Monsters do that,” I said. “Sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You killed my trainee!” Kelli yelled. “You need a lesson in school spirit,
                        half-blood!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she too began to change. Her wiry hair turned to flickering flames. Her
                        eyes turned red.
                        She grew fangs. She loped toward us, her brass foot and hoof clopping unevenly on the band-room
                        floor. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I am senior <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>,” she growled. “No hero has bested
                        me in a
                        thousand years.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah?” I said. “Then you’re overdue!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kelli was a lot faster than Tammi. She dodged my first strike and rolled into
                        the brass
                        section, knocking over a row of trombones with a mighty crash. Rachel scrambled out of the way.
                        I put myself
                        between her and the <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>. Kelli circled us, her eyes going from me to
                        the sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Such a pretty little blade,” she said. “What a shame it stands between us.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her form shimmered—sometimes a demon, sometimes a pretty cheerleader. I tried
                        to keep my mind
                        focused, but it was really distracting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Poor dear.” Kelli chuckled. “You don’t even know what’s happening, do you?
                        Soon, your pretty
                        little camp in flames, your friends made slaves to the Lord of Time, and there’s nothing you can
                        do to stop it.
                        It would be merciful to end your life now, before you have to see that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">From down the hall, I heard voices. A tour group was approaching. A man was
                        saying something
                        about locker combinations. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The <i class="calibre5">empousa</i>’s eyes lit up. “Excellent! We’re about to
                        have company!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She picked up a tuba and threw it at me. Rachel and I ducked. The tuba sailed
                        over our heads
                        and crashed through the window. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The voices in the hall died down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Kelli shouted, pretending to be scared, “why did you throw that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was too surprised to answer. Kelli picked up a music stand and swiped a row
                        of clarinets and
                        flutes. Chairs and musical instruments crashed to the floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stop it!” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">People were tromping down the hall now, coming in our direction. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Time to greet our visitors!” Kelli bared her fangs and ran for the doors. I
                        charged after her
                        with Riptide. I had to stop her from hurting the mortals. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, don’t!” Rachel shouted. But I hadn’t realized what Kelli was up to
                        until it was too
                        late. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kelli flung open the doors. Paul Blofis and a bunch of freshmen stepped back in
                        shock. I raised
                        my sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the last second, the <i class="calibre5">empousa </i>turned toward me like a
                        cowering
                        victim. “Oh no, please!” she cried. I couldn’t stop my blade. It was already in motion. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Just before the celestial bronze hit her, Kelli exploded into flames like a
                        Molotov cocktail.
                        Waves of fire splashed over everything. I’d never seen a monster do that before, but I didn’t
                        have time to
                        wonder about it. I backed into the band room as flames engulfed the doorway. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy?” Paul Blofis looked completely stunned, staring at me from across the
                        fire. “What have
                        you done?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Kids screamed and ran down the hall. The fire alarm wailed. Ceiling sprinklers
                        hissed to life.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">In the chaos, Rachel tugged on my sleeve. “You have to get out of here!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was right. The school was in flames and I’d be held responsible. Mortals
                        couldn’t see
                        through the Mist properly. To them it would look like I’d just attacked a helpless cheerleader
                        in front of a
                        group of witnesses. There was no way I could explain it. I turned from Paul and sprinted for the
                        broken band
                        room window. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I burst out of the alley onto East 81st and ran straight into Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, you’re out early!” She laughed, grabbing my shoulders to keep me from
                        tumbling into the
                        street. “Watch where you’re going, Seaweed Brain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a split second she was in a good mood and everything was fine. She was
                        wearing jeans and an
                        orange camp T-shirt and her clay bead necklace. Her blond hair was pulled back in a ponytail.
                        Her gray eyes
                        sparkled. She looked like she was ready to catch a movie, have a cool afternoon hanging out
                        together. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/1-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Then Rachel Elizabeth Dare, still covered in monster dust, came charging out of
                        the alley,
                        yelling, “Percy, wait up!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s smile melted. She stared at Rachel, then at the school. For the
                        first time, she
                        seemed to notice the black smoke and the ringing fire alarms. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She frowned at me. “What did you do this time? And who is this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Rachel—Annabeth. Annabeth—Rachel. Um, she’s a friend. I guess.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t sure what else to call Rachel. I mean, I barely knew her, but after
                        being in two
                        life-or-death situations together, I couldn’t just call her nobody. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi,” Rachel said. Then she turned to me. “You are in <i class="calibre5">so
                        </i>much trouble.
                        And you still owe me an explanation!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Police sirens wailed on FDR Drive. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Annabeth said coldly. “We should go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I want to know more about half-bloods,” Rachel insisted. “And monsters. And
                        this stuff about
                        the gods.” She grabbed my arm, whipped out a permanent marker, and wrote a phone number on my
                        hand. “You’re
                        going to call me and explain, okay? You owe me that. Now get going.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll make up some story,” Rachel said. “I’ll tell them it wasn’t your fault.
                        Just go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She ran back toward the school, leaving Annabeth and me in the street. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stared at me for a second. Then she turned and took off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” I jogged after her. “There were these two <i
                            class="calibre5">empou</i><i class="calibre5">sai</i>,” I tried to explain. “They were
                        cheerleaders, see, and they said camp was going to
                        burn, and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You told a mortal girl about half-bloods?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She can see through the Mist. She saw the monsters before I did.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So you told her the truth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She recognized me from Hoover Dam, so—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve met her <i class="calibre5">before</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um, last winter. But seriously, I barely know her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She’s kind of cute.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I never thought about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth kept walking toward York Avenue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll deal with the school,” I promised, anxious to change the subject.
                        “Honest, it’ll be
                        fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth wouldn’t even look at me. “I guess our afternoon is off. We should get
                        you out of
                        here, now that the police will be searching for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind us, smoke billowed up from Goode High School. In the dark column of
                        ashes, I thought I
                        could almost see a face—a she-demon with red eyes, laughing at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Your pretty little camp in flames</i>, Kelli had said. <i
                            class="calibre5">Your friends made slaves to the Lord of Time</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re right,” I told Annabeth, my heart sinking. “We have to get to Camp
                        Half-Blood. <i class="calibre5">Now</i>.” </p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to talk to Annabeth, but she was acting like I’d just punched her
                        grandmother. All I
                        managed to get out of her was that she’d had a monster-infested spring in San Francisco; she’d
                        come back to camp
                        twice since Christmas but wouldn’t tell me why (which kind of ticked me off, because she hadn’t
                        even told me she
                        was in New York); and she’d learned nothing about the whereabouts of Nico di Angelo (long
                        story). </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Any word on Luke?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She shook her head. I knew this was a touchy subject for her. Annabeth had
                        always admired Luke,
                        the former head counselor for Hermes who had betrayed us and joined the evil Titan Lord Kronos.
                        She wouldn’t
                        admit it, but I knew she still liked him. When we’d fought Luke on Mount Tamalpais last winter,
                        he’d somehow
                        survived a fifty-foot fall off a cliff. Now, as far as I knew, he was still sailing around on
                        his demon-infested
                        cruise ship while his chopped-up Lord Kronos re-formed, bit by bit, in a golden sarcophagus,
                        biding his time
                        until he had enough power to challenge the Olympian gods. In demigod-speak, we call this a
                        “problem.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mount Tam is still overrun with monsters,” Annabeth said. “I didn’t dare go
                        close, but I don’t
                        think Luke is up there. I think I would know if he was.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That didn’t make me feel much better. “What about Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s at camp,” she said. “We’ll see him today.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Did he have any luck? I mean, with the search for Pan?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth fingered her bead necklace, the way she does when she’s worried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ll see,” she said. But she didn’t explain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As we headed through Brooklyn, I used Annabeth’s phone to call my mom.

                        use cell phones if we can avoid it, because broadcasting our voices is like sending up a flare
                        to the monsters:
                        <i class="calibre5">Here I am! Please eat me now! </i>But I figured this call was important. I
                        left a message on
                        our home voice mail, trying to explain what had happened at Goode. I probably didn’t do a very
                        good job. I told
                        my mom I was fine, she shouldn’t worry, but I was going to stay at camp until things cooled
                        down. I asked her to
                        tell Paul Blofis I was sorry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We rode in silence after that. The city melted away until we were off the
                        expressway and
                        rolling through the countryside of northern Long Island, past orchards and wineries and fresh
                        produce stands.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the phone number Rachel Elizabeth Dare had scrawled on my hand. I
                        knew it was
                        crazy, but I was tempted to call her. Maybe she could help me understand what the <i
                            class="calibre5">empousa
                        </i>had been talking about—the camp burning, my friends imprisoned. And why had Kelli exploded
                        into flames? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew monsters never truly died. Eventually—maybe weeks, months, or years from
                        now—Kelli would
                        re-form out of the primordial nastiness seething in the Underworld. But still, monsters didn’t
                        usually let
                        themselves get destroyed so easily. If she really <i class="calibre5">was </i>destroyed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The taxi exited on Route 25A. We headed through the woods along the North Shore
                        until a low
                        ridge of hills appeared on our left. Annabeth told the driver to pull over on Farm Road 3.141,
                        at the base of
                        Half-Blood Hill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The driver frowned. “There ain’t nothing here, miss. You sure you want out?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, please.” Annabeth handed him a roll of mortal cash, and the driver
                        decided not to argue.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and I hiked to the crest of the hill. The young guardian dragon was
                        dozing, coiled
                        around the pine tree, but he lifted his coppery head as we approached and let Annabeth scratch
                        under his chin.
                        Steam hissed out his nostrils like from a teakettle, and he went cross-eyed with pleasure. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, Peleus,” Annabeth said. “Keeping everything safe?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The last time I’d seen the dragon he’d been six feet long. Now he was at least
                        twice that, and
                        as thick around as the tree itself. Above his head, on the lowest branch of the pine tree, the
                        Golden Fleece
                        shimmered, its magic protecting the camp’s borders from invasion. The dragon seemed relaxed,
                        like everything was
                        okay. Below us, Camp Half-Blood looked peaceful—green fields, forest, shiny white Greek
                        buildings. The
                        four-story farmhouse we called the Big House sat proudly in the midst of the strawberry fields.
                        To the north,
                        past the beach, the Long Island Sound glittered in the sunlight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Still…something felt wrong. There was tension in the air, as if the hill itself
                        were holding
                        its breath, waiting for something bad to happen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We walked down into the valley and found the summer session in full swing. Most
                        of the campers
                        had arrived last Friday, so I already felt out of it. The satyrs were playing their pipes in the
                        strawberry
                        fields, making the plants grow with woodland magic. Campers were having flying horseback
                        lessons, swooping over
                        the woods on their pegasi. Smoke rose from the forges, and hammers rang as kids made their own
                        weapons for Arts
                        &amp; Crafts. The Athena and Demeter teams were having a chariot race around the track, and over
                        at the canoe
                        lake some kids in a Greek trireme were fighting a large orange sea serpent. A typical day at
                        camp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I need to talk to Clarisse,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at her as if she’d just said <i class="calibre5">I need to eat a
                            large, smelly
                            boot</i>. “What for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse from the Ares cabin was one of my least favorite people. She was a
                        mean, ungrateful
                        bully. Her dad, the war god, wanted to kill me. She tried to beat me to a pulp on a regular
                        basis. Other than
                        that, she was just great. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ve been working on something,” Annabeth said. “I’ll see you later.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Working on what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth glanced toward the forest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll tell Chiron you’re here,” she said. “He’ll want to talk to you before the
                        hearing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What hearing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But she jogged down the path toward the archery field without looking back.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” I muttered. “Great talking with you, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"> </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">As I made my way through camp, I said hi to some of my friends. In the Big
                        House’s driveway,
                        Connor and Travis Stoll from the Hermes cabin were hot-wiring the camp’s SUV. Silena Beauregard,
                        the head
                        counselor for Aphrodite, waved at me from her pegasus as she flew past. I looked for Grover, but
                        I didn’t see
                        him. Finally I wandered into the sword arena, where I usually go when I’m in a bad mood.
                        Practicing always calms
                        me down. Maybe that’s because swordplay is one thing I actually understand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I walked into the amphitheater and my heart almost stopped. In the middle of
                        the arena floor,
                        with its back to me, was the biggest hellhound I’d ever seen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I mean, I’ve seen some pretty big hellhounds. One the size of a rhino tried to
                        kill me when I
                        was twelve. But <i class="calibre5">this </i>hellhound was bigger than a tank. I had no idea how
                        it had gotten
                        past the camp’s magic boundaries. It looked right at home, lying on its belly, growling
                        contentedly as it chewed
                        the head off a combat dummy. It hadn’t noticed me yet, but if I made a sound, I knew it would
                        sense me. There
                        was no time to go for help. I pulled out Riptide and uncapped it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yaaaaah!” I charged. I brought down the blade on the monster’s enormous
                        backside when out of
                        nowhere another sword blocked my strike. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">CLANG! </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The hellhound pricked up its ears. <i class="calibre5">“WOOF!” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I jumped back and instinctively struck at the swordsman— a gray-haired man in
                        Greek armor. He
                        parried my attack with no problem. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa there!” he said. “Truce!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">“WOOF!” </i>The hellhound’s bark shook the arena. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s a hellhound!” I shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She’s harmless,” the man said. “That’s Mrs. O’Leary.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked. “Mrs. O’Leary?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the sound of her name, the hellhound barked again. I realized she wasn’t
                        angry. She was
                        excited. She nudged the soggy, badly chewed target dummy toward the swordsman. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good girl,” the man said. With his free hand he grabbed the armored manikin by
                        the neck and
                        heaved it toward the bleachers. “Get the Greek! Get the Greek!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. O’Leary bounded after her prey and pounced on the dummy, flattening its
                        armor. She began
                        chewing on its helmet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The swordsman smiled dryly. He was in his fifties, I guess, with short gray
                        hair and a clipped
                        gray beard. He was in good shape for an older guy. He wore black mountain-climbing pants and a
                        bronze
                        breastplate strapped over an orange camp T-shirt. At the base of his neck was a strange mark, a
                        purplish blotch
                        like a birthmark or a tattoo, but before I could make out what it was, he shifted his armor
                        straps and the mark
                        disappeared under his collar. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mrs. O’Leary is my pet,” he explained. “I couldn’t let you stick a sword in
                        her rump, now,
                        could I? That might have scared her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who are you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Promise not to kill me if I put my sword away?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I guess.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He sheathed his sword and held out his hand. “Quintus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shook his hand. It was as rough as sandpaper. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy Jackson,” I said. “Sorry about—How did you, um—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Get a hellhound for a pet? Long story, involving many close calls with death
                        and quite a few
                        giant chew toys. I’m the new sword instructor, by the way. Helping out Chiron while Mr. D is
                        away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh.” I tried not to stare as Mrs. O’Leary ripped off the target dummy’s shield
                        with the arm
                        still attached and shook it like a Frisbee. “Wait, Mr. D is away?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, well…busy times. Even Dionysus must help out. He’s gone to visit some old
                        friends. Make
                        sure they’re on the right side. I probably shouldn’t say more than that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">If Dionysus was gone, that was the best news I’d had all day. He was only our
                        camp director
                        because Zeus had sent him here as a punishment for chasing some off-limits wood nymph. He hated
                        the campers and
                        tried to make our lives miserable. With him away, this summer might actually be cool. On the
                        other hand, if
                        Dionysus had gotten off his butt and actually started helping the gods recruit against the Titan
                        threat, things
                        must be looking pretty bad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Off to my left, there was a loud <i class="calibre5">BUMP</i>. Six wooden
                        crates the size of
                        picnic tables were stacked nearby, and they were rattling. Mrs. O’Leary cocked her head and
                        bounded toward them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa, girl!” Quintus said. “Those aren’t for you.” He distracted her with the
                        bronze shield
                        Frisbee. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The crates thumped and shook. There were words printed on the sides, but with
                        my dyslexia they
                        took me a few minutes to decipher: </p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="center">TRIPLE G RANCH <br class="calibre1" />
                        FRAGILE <br class="calibre1" />
                        THIS END UP</p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Along the bottom, in smaller letters: <small>OPEN WITH CARE. TRIPLE G RANCH IS
                            NOT
                            RESPONSIBLE FOR
                            PROPERTY DAMAGE, MAIMING, OR EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL DEATHS.</small> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s in the boxes?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A little surprise,” Quintus said. “Training activity for tomorrow night.
                        You’ll love it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh, okay,” I said, though I wasn’t sure about the “excruciatingly painful
                        death” part. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus threw the bronze shield, and Mrs. O’Leary lumbered after it. “You young
                        ones need more
                        challenges. They didn’t have camps like this when I was a boy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You—you’re a half-blood?” I didn’t mean to sound so surprised, but I’d never
                        seen an old
                        demigod before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus chuckled. “Some of us <i class="calibre5">do </i>survive into
                        adulthood, you know. Not
                        all of us are the subject of terrible prophecies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You know about my prophecy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve heard a few things.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to ask <i class="calibre5">what </i>few things, but just then Chiron
                        clip-clopped into
                        the arena. “Percy, there you are!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He must’ve just come from teaching archery. He had a quiver and bow slung over
                        his #1 CENTAUR
                        T-shirt. He’d trimmed his curly brown hair and beard for the summer, and his lower half, which
                        was a white
                        stallion, was flecked with mud and grass. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I see you’ve met our new instructor.” Chiron’s tone was light, but there was
                        an uneasy look in
                        his eyes. “Quintus, do you mind if I borrow Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not at all, Master Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No need to call me ‘Master,’” Chiron said, though he sounded sort of pleased.
                        “Come, Percy. We
                        have much to discuss.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took one more glance at Mrs. O’Leary, who was now chewing off the target
                        dummy’s legs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, see you,” I told Quintus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As we were walking away, I whispered to Chiron, “Quintus seems kind of—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mysterious?” Chiron suggested. “Hard to read?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron nodded. “A very qualified half-blood. Excellent swordsman. I just wish I
                        understood…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Whatever he was going to say, he apparently changed his mind. “First things
                        first, Percy.
                        Annabeth told me you met some <i class="calibre5">empousai</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” I told him about the fight at Goode, and how Kelli had exploded into
                        flames. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mm,” Chiron said. “The more powerful ones can do that. She did not die, Percy.
                        She simply
                        escaped. It is not good that the she-demons are stirring.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What were they doing there?” I asked. “Waiting for me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Possibly.” Chiron frowned. “It is amazing you survived. Their powers of
                        deception…almost any
                        male hero would’ve fallen under their spell and been devoured.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I would’ve been,” I admitted. “Except for Rachel.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron nodded. “Ironic to be saved by a mortal, yet we owe her a debt. What the
                        <i class="calibre5">empousa </i>said about an attack on camp—we must speak of this further. But
                        for now, come,
                        we should get to the woods. Grover will want you there.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“At his formal hearing,” Chiron said grimly. “The Council of Cloven Elders is
                        meeting now to
                        decide his fate.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron said we needed to hurry, so I let him give me a ride on his back. As we
                        galloped past
                        the cabins, I glanced at the dining hall—an open-air Greek pavilion on a hill overlooking the
                        sea. It was the
                        first time I’d seen the place since last summer, and it brought back bad memories. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron plunged into the woods. Nymphs peeked out of the trees to watch us pass.
                        Large shapes
                        rustled in the shadows—monsters that were stocked in here as a challenge to the campers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought I knew the forest pretty well after playing capture the flag here for
                        two summers,
                        but Chiron took me a way I didn’t recognize, through a tunnel of old willow trees, past a little
                        waterfall, and
                        into a glade blanketed with wildflowers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bunch of satyrs were sitting in a circle in the grass. Grover stood in the
                        middle, facing
                        three really old, really fat satyrs who sat on topiary thrones shaped out of rose bushes. I’d
                        never seen the
                        three old satyrs before, but I guessed they must be the Council of Cloven Elders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover seemed to be telling them a story. He twisted the bottom of his T-shirt,
                        shifting
                        nervously on his goat hooves. He hadn’t changed much since last winter, maybe because satyrs age
                        half as fast as
                        humans. His acne had flared up. His horns had gotten a little bigger so they just stuck out over
                        his curly hair.
                        I realized with a start that I was taller than he was now. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Standing off to one side of the circle were Annabeth, another girl I’d never
                        seen before, and
                        Clarisse. Chiron dropped me next to them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse’s stringy brown hair was tied back with a camouflage bandanna. If
                        possible, she looked
                        even buffer, like she’d been working out. She glared at me and muttered, “Punk,” which must’ve
                        meant she was in
                        a good mood. Usually she says hello by trying to kill me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth had her arm around the other girl, who looked like she’d been crying.
                        She was
                        small—petite, I guess you’d call it—with wispy hair the color of amber and a pretty, elfish
                        face. She wore a
                        green chiton and laced sandals, and she was dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief. “It’s going
                        terribly,” she
                        sniffled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, no.” Annabeth patted her shoulder. “He’ll be fine, Juniper.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth looked at me and mouthed the words <i class="calibre5">Grover’s
                            girlfriend</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At least I thought that’s what she said, but that made no sense. Grover with a
                        girlfriend? Then
                        I looked at Juniper more closely, and I realized her ears were slightly pointed. Her eyes,
                        instead of being red
                        from crying, were tinged green, the color of chlorophyll. She was a tree nymph—a dryad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Master Underwood!” the council member on the right shouted, cutting off
                        whatever Grover was
                        trying to say. “Do you seriously expect us to believe this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“B-but, Silenus,” Grover stammered. “It’s the truth!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Council guy, Silenus, turned to his colleagues and muttered something.
                        Chiron cantered up
                        to the front and stood next to them. I remembered he was an honorary member of the council, but
                        I’d never
                        thought about it much. The elders didn’t look very impressive. They reminded me of the goats in
                        a petting
                        zoo—huge bellies, sleepy expressions, and glazed eyes that couldn’t see past the next handful of
                        goat chow. I
                        wasn’t sure why Grover looked so nervous. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Silenus tugged his yellow polo shirt over his belly and adjusted himself on his
                        rosebush
                        throne. “Master Underwood, for six months—<i class="calibre5">six months</i>—we have been
                        hearing these
                        scandalous claims that you heard the wild god Pan speak.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But I did!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Impudence!” said the elder on the left. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now, Maron,” Chiron said. “Patience.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Patience, indeed!” Maron said. “I’ve had it up to my horns with this nonsense.
                        As if the wild
                        god would speak to…to <i class="calibre5">him</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper looked like she wanted to charge the old satyr and beat him up, but
                        Annabeth and
                        Clarisse held her back. “Wrong fight, girlie,” Clarisse muttered. “Wait.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I don’t know what surprised me more: Clarisse holding somebody back from a
                        fight, or the fact
                        that she and Annabeth, who despised each other, almost seemed like they were working together.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“For six months,” Silenus continued, “we have indulged you, Master Underwood.
                        We let you
                        travel. We allowed you to keep your searcher’s license. We waited for you to bring proof of your
                        preposterous
                        claim. And what have you found in six months of travel?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I just need more time,” Grover pleaded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nothing!” the elder in the middle chimed in. “You have found nothing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But, Leneus—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Silenus raised his hand. Chiron leaned in and said something to the satyrs. The
                        satyrs didn’t
                        look happy. They muttered and argued among themselves, but Chiron said something else, and
                        Silenus sighed. He
                        nodded reluctantly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Master Underwood,” Silenus announced, “we will give you one more chance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover brightened. “Thank you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“One more week.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What? But, sir! That’s impossible!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“One more week, Master Underwood. And then, if you cannot prove your claims, it
                        will be time
                        for you to pursue another career. Something to suit your dramatic talents. Puppet theater,
                        perhaps. Or tap
                        dancing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But, sir, I—I can’t lose my searcher’s license. My whole life—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This meeting of the council is adjourned,” Silenus said. “And now let us enjoy
                        our noonday
                        meal!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old satyr clapped his hands, and a bunch of nymphs melted out of the trees
                        with platters of
                        vegetables, fruits, tin cans, and other goat delicacies. The circle of satyrs broke and charged
                        the food. Grover
                        walked dejectedly toward us. His faded blue T-shirt had a picture of a satyr on it. It read GOT
                        HOOVES? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hi, Percy,” he said, so depressed he didn’t even offer to shake my hand. “That
                        went well,
                        huh?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Those old goats!” Juniper said. “Oh, Grover, they don’t know how hard you’ve
                        tried!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There is another option,” Clarisse said darkly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. No.” Juniper shook her head. “Grover, I won’t let you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His face was ashen. “I—I’ll have to think about it. But we don’t even know
                        where to look.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What are you talking about?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the distance, a conch horn sounded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth pursed her lips. “I’ll fill you in later, Percy. We’d better get back
                        to our cabins.
                        Inspection is starting.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">It didn’t seem fair that I’d have to do cabin inspection when I just got to
                        camp, but that’s
                        the way it worked. Every afternoon, one of the senior counselors came around with a papyrus
                        scroll checklist.
                        Best cabin got first shower hour, which meant hot water guaranteed. Worst cabin got kitchen
                        patrol after dinner.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The problem for me: I was usually the only one in the Poseidon cabin, and I’m
                        not exactly what
                        you would call neat. The cleaning harpies only came through on the last day of summer, so my
                        cabin was probably
                        just the way I’d left it on winter break: my candy wrappers and chip bags still on my bunk, my
                        armor for capture
                        the flag lying in pieces all around the cabin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I raced toward the commons area, where the twelve cabins—one for each Olympian
                        god—made a U
                        around the central green. The Demeter kids were sweeping out theirs and making fresh flowers
                        grow in their
                        window boxes. Just by snapping their fingers they could make honeysuckle vines bloom over their
                        doorway and
                        daisies cover their roof, which was totally unfair. I don’t think they ever got last place in
                        inspection. The
                        guys in the Hermes cabin were scrambling around in a panic, stashing dirty laundry under their
                        beds and accusing
                        each other of taking stuff. They were slobs, but they still had a head start on me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Over at the Aphrodite cabin, Silena Beauregard was just coming out, checking
                        items off the
                        inspection scroll. I cursed under my breath. Silena was nice, but she was an absolute neat
                        freak, the worst
                        inspector. She liked things to be pretty. I didn’t do “pretty.” I could almost feel my arms
                        getting heavy from
                        all the dishes I would have to scrub tonight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Poseidon cabin was at the end of the row of “male god” cabins on the right
                        side of the
                        green. It was made of gray shell-encrusted sea rock, long and low like a bunker, but it had
                        windows that faced
                        the sea and it always had a good breeze blowing through it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I dashed inside, wondering if maybe I could do a quick under-the-bed cleaning
                        job like the
                        Hermes guys, and I found my half-brother Tyson sweeping the floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” he bellowed. He dropped his broom and ran at me. If you’ve never been
                        charged by an
                        enthusiastic Cyclops wearing a flowered apron and rubber cleaning gloves, I’m telling you, it’ll
                        wake you up
                        quick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, big guy!” I said. “Ow, watch the ribs. The ribs.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed to survive his bear hug. He put me down, grinning like crazy, his
                        single calf-brown
                        eye full of excitement. His teeth were as yellow and crooked as ever, and his hair was a rat’s
                        nest. He wore
                        ragged XXXL jeans and a tattered flannel shirt under his flowered apron, but he was still a
                        sight for sore eyes.
                        I hadn’t seen him in almost a year, since he’d gone under the sea to work at the Cyclopes’
                        forges. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You are okay?” he asked. “Not eaten by monsters?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not even a little bit.” I showed him that I still had both arms and both legs,
                        and Tyson
                        clapped happily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yay!” he said. “Now we can eat peanut butter sandwiches and ride fish ponies!
                        We can fight
                        monsters and see Annabeth and make things go BOOM!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hoped he didn’t mean all at the same time, but I told him absolutely, we’d
                        have a lot of fun
                        this summer. I couldn’t help smiling, he was so enthusiastic about everything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But first,” I said, “we’ve gotta worry about inspection. We should…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I looked around and realized Tyson had been busy. The floor was swept. The
                        bunk beds were
                        made. The saltwater fountain in the corner had been freshly scrubbed so the coral gleamed. On
                        the windowsills,
                        Tyson had set out water-filled vases with sea anemones and strange glowing plants from the
                        bottom of the ocean,
                        more beautiful than any flower bouquets the Demeter kids could whip up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tyson, the cabin looks…amazing!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He beamed. “See the fish ponies? I put them on the ceiling!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A herd of miniature bronze hippocampi hung on wires from the ceiling, so it
                        looked like they
                        were swimming through the air. I couldn’t believe Tyson, with his huge hands, could make things
                        so delicate.
                        Then I looked over at my bunk, and I saw my old shield hanging on the wall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You fixed it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The shield had been badly damaged in a manticore attack last winter, but now it
                        was perfect
                        again—not a scratch. All the bronze pictures of my adventures with Tyson and Annabeth in the Sea
                        of Monsters
                        were polished and gleaming. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at Tyson. I didn’t know how to thank him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then somebody behind me said, “Oh, my.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Silena Beauregard was standing in the doorway with her inspection scroll. She
                        stepped into the
                        cabin, did a quick twirl, then raised her eyebrows at me. “Well, I had my doubts. But you clean
                        up nicely,
                        Percy. I’ll remember that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She winked at me and left the room. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson and I spent the afternoon catching up and just hanging out, which was
                        nice after a
                        morning of getting attacked by demon cheerleaders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We went down to the forge and helped Beckendorf from the Hephaestus cabin with
                        his
                        metalworking. Tyson showed us how he’d learned to craft magic weapons. He fashioned a flaming
                        double-bladed war
                        axe so fast even Beckendorf was impressed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">While he worked, Tyson told us about his year under the sea. His eye lit up
                        when he described
                        the Cyclopes’ forges and the palace of Poseidon, but he also told us how tense things were. The
                        old gods of the
                        sea, who’d ruled during Titan times, were starting to make war on our father. When Tyson had
                        left, battles had
                        been raging all over the Atlantic. Hearing that made me feel anxious, like I should be helping
                        out, but Tyson
                        assured me that Dad wanted us both at camp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Lots of bad people above the sea, too,” Tyson said. “We can make them go
                        boom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After the forges, we spent some time at the canoe lake with Annabeth. She was
                        really glad to
                        see Tyson, but I could tell she was distracted. She kept looking over at the forest, like she
                        was thinking about
                        Grover’s problem with the council. I couldn’t blame her. Grover was nowhere to be seen, and I
                        felt really bad
                        for him. Finding the lost god Pan had been his lifelong goal. His father and his uncle had both
                        disappeared
                        following the same dream. Last winter, Grover had heard a voice in his head: <i
                            class="calibre5">I await
                            you</i>—a voice he was sure belonged to Pan—but apparently his search had led nowhere. If
                        the council took
                        away his searcher’s license now, it would crush him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s this ‘other way’?” I asked Annabeth. “The thing Clarisse mentioned?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She picked up a stone and skipped it across the lake. “Something Clarisse
                        scouted out. I helped
                        her a little this spring. But it would be dangerous. Especially for Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Goat boy scares me,” Tyson murmured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at him. Tyson had faced down fire-breathing bulls and sea monsters and
                        cannibal
                        giants. “Why would you be scared of Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hooves and horns,” Tyson muttered nervously. “And goat fur makes my nose
                        itchy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And that pretty much ended our Grover conversation. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Before dinner, Tyson and I went down to the sword arena. Quintus was glad to
                        have company. He
                        still wouldn’t tell me what was in the wooden crates, but he did teach me a few sword moves. The
                        guy was good.
                        He fought the way some people play chess—like he was putting all the moves together and you
                        couldn’t see the
                        pattern until he made the last stroke and won with a sword at your throat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good try,” he told me. “But your guard is too low.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He lunged and I blocked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Have you always been a swordsman?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He parried my overhead cut. “I’ve been many things.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He jabbed and I sidestepped. His shoulder strap slipped down, and I saw that
                        mark on his
                        neck—the purple blotch. But it wasn’t a random mark. It had a definite shape—a bird with folded
                        wings, like a
                        quail or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s that on your neck?” I asked, which was probably a rude question, but
                        you can blame my
                        ADHD. I tend to just blurt things out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus lost his rhythm. I hit his sword hilt and knocked the blade out of his
                        hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He rubbed his fingers. Then he shifted his armor to hide the mark. It wasn’t a
                        tattoo, I
                        realized. It was an old burn…like he’d been branded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A reminder.” He picked up his sword and forced a smile. “Now, shall we go
                        again?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pressed me hard, not giving me time for any more questions. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">While he and I fought, Tyson played with Mrs. O’Leary, who he called the
                        “little doggie.” They
                        had a great time wrestling for the bronze shield and playing Get the Greek. By sunset, Quintus
                        hadn’t even
                        broken a sweat, which seemed kind of strange; but Tyson and I were hot and sticky, so we hit the
                        showers and got
                        ready for dinner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was feeling good. It was almost like a normal day at camp. Then dinner came,
                        and all the
                        campers lined up by cabin and marched into the dining pavilion. Most of them ignored the sealed
                        fissure in the
                        marble floor at the entrance—a ten-foot-long jagged scar that hadn’t been there last summer—but
                        I was careful to
                        step over it. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-9.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Big crack,” Tyson said when we were at our table. “Earthquake, maybe?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I said. “Not an earthquake.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t sure I should tell him. It was a secret only Annabeth and Grover and I
                        knew. But
                        looking in Tyson’s big eye, I knew I couldn’t hide anything from him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nico di Angelo,” I said, lowering my voice. “He’s this half-blood kid we
                        brought to camp last
                        winter. He, uh…he asked me to guard his sister on a quest, and I failed. She died. Now he blames
                        me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson frowned. “So he put a crack in the floor?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“These skeletons attacked us,” I said. “Nico told them to go away, and the
                        ground just opened
                        up and swallowed them. Nico…” I looked around to make sure no one was listening. “Nico is a son
                        of Hades.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson nodded thoughtfully. “The god of dead people.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So the Nico boy is gone now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I guess. I tried to search for him this spring. So did Annabeth. But we
                        didn’t have any
                        luck. This is secret, Tyson. Okay? If anyone found out he was a son of Hades, he would be in
                        danger. You can’t
                        even tell Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The bad prophecy,” Tyson said. “Titans might use him if they knew.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at him. Sometimes it was easy to forget that as big and childlike as
                        he was, Tyson was
                        pretty smart. He knew that the next child of the Big Three gods—Zeus, Poseidon, or Hades—who
                        turned sixteen was
                        prophesied to either save or destroy Mount Olympus. Most people assumed that meant me, but if I
                        died before I
                        turned sixteen, the prophecy could just as easily apply to Nico. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Exactly,” I said. “So—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mouth sealed,” Tyson promised. “Like the crack in the ground.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I had trouble falling asleep that night. I lay in bed listening to the waves on
                        the beach, and
                        the owls and monsters in the woods. I was afraid once I drifted off I’d have nightmares. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">See, for half-bloods, dreams are hardly ever just dreams. We get messages. We
                        glimpse things
                        that are happening to our friends or enemies. Sometimes we even glimpse the past or the future.
                        And at camp, my
                        dreams were always more frequent and vivid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">So I was still awake around midnight, staring at the bunk bed mattress above
                        me, when I
                        realized there was a strange light in the room. The saltwater fountain was glowing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I threw off the covers and walked cautiously toward it. Steam rose from the hot
                        salt water.
                        Rainbow colors shimmered through it, though there was no light in the room except for the moon
                        outside. Then a
                        pleasant female voice spoke from the steam: <i class="calibre5">Please deposit one drachma</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked over at Tyson, but he was still snoring. He sleeps about as heavily as
                        a tranquilized
                        elephant. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what to think. I’d never gotten a collect Iris-message before.
                        One golden drachma
                        gleamed at the bottom of the fountain. I scooped it up and tossed it through the mist. The coin
                        vanished. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“O, Iris, Goddess of the Rainbow,” I whispered. “Show me…Uh, whatever you need
                        to show me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The mist shimmered. I saw the dark shore of a river. Wisps of fog drifted
                        across black water.
                        The beach was strewn with jagged volcanic rock. A young boy squatted at the riverbank, tending a
                        campfire. The
                        flames burned an unnatural blue color. Then I saw the boy’s face. It was Nico di Angelo. He was
                        throwing pieces
                        of paper into the fire— Mythomagic trading cards, part of the game he’d been obsessed with last
                        winter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico was only ten, or maybe eleven by now, but he looked older. His hair had
                        grown longer. It
                        was shaggy and almost touched his shoulders. His eyes were dark. His olive skin had turned
                        paler. He wore ripped
                        black jeans and a battered aviator’s jacket that was several sizes too big, unzipped over a
                        black shirt. His
                        face was grimy, his eyes a little wild. He looked like a kid who’d been living on the streets.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-10.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I waited for him to look at me. No doubt he’d get crazy angry, start accusing
                        me of letting his
                        sister die. But he didn’t seem to notice me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stayed quiet, not daring to move. If he hadn’t sent this Iris-message, who
                        had? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico tossed another trading card into the blue flames. “Useless,” he muttered.
                        “I can’t believe
                        I ever liked this stuff.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A childish game, master,” another voice agreed. It seemed to come from near
                        the fire, but I
                        couldn’t see who was talking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico stared across the river. On the far shore was black beach shrouded in
                        haze. I recognized
                        it: the Underworld. Nico was camping at the edge of the River Styx. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve failed,” he muttered. “There’s no way to get her back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The other voice kept silent. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico turned toward it doubtfully. “Is there? Speak.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Something shimmered. I thought it was just firelight. Then I realized it was
                        the form of a
                        man—a wisp of blue smoke, a shadow. If you looked at him head-on, he wasn’t there. But if you
                        looked out of the
                        corner of your eye, you could make out his shape. A ghost. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It has never been done,” the ghost said. “But there may be a way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tell me,” Nico commanded. His eyes shined with a fierce light. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“An exchange,” the ghost said. “A soul for a soul.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve offered!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not yours,” the ghost said. “You cannot offer your father a soul he will
                        eventually collect
                        anyway. Nor will he be anxious for the death of his son. I mean a soul that should have died
                        already. Someone
                        who has cheated death.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico’s face darkened. “Not that again. You’re talking about murder.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m talking about justice,” the ghost said. “Vengeance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Those are not the same thing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The ghost laughed dryly. “You will learn differently as you get older.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/2-11.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico stared at the flames. “Why can’t I at least summon her? I want to talk to
                        her. She
                        would…she would help me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<i class="calibre5">I </i>will help you,” the ghost promised. “Have I not
                        saved you many
                        times? Did I not lead you through the maze and teach you to use your powers? Do you want revenge
                        for your sister
                        or not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t like the ghost’s tone of voice. He reminded me of a kid at my old
                        school, a bully who
                        used to convince other kids to do stupid things like steal lab equipment and vandalize the
                        teachers’ cars. The
                        bully never got in trouble himself, but he got tons of other kids suspended. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico turned from the fire so the ghost couldn’t see him, but I could. A tear
                        traced its way
                        down his face. “Very well. You have a plan?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, yes,” the ghost said, sounding quite pleased. “We have many dark roads to
                        travel. We must
                        start—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The image shimmered. Nico vanished. The woman’s voice from the mist said, <i
                            class="calibre5">Please deposit one drachma for another five minutes. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There were no other coins in the fountain. I grabbed for my pockets, but I was
                        wearing pajamas.
                        I lunged for the nightstand to check for spare change, but the Iris-message had already blinked
                        out, and the
                        room went dark again. The connection was broken. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stood in the middle of the cabin, listening to the gurgle of the saltwater
                        fountain and the
                        ocean waves outside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico was alive. He was trying to bring his sister back from the dead. And I had
                        a feeling I
                        knew what soul he wanted to exchange—someone who had cheated death. Vengeance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nico di Angelo would come looking for me. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">The next morning there was a lot of excitement at breakfast. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Apparently around three in the morning an Aethiopian drakon had been spotted at
                        the borders of
                        camp. I was so exhausted I slept right through the noise. The magical boundaries had kept the
                        monster out, but
                        it prowled the hills, looking for weak spots in our defenses, and it didn’t seem anxious to go
                        away until Lee
                        Fletcher from Apollo’s cabin led a couple of his siblings in pursuit. After a few dozen arrows
                        lodged in the
                        chinks of the drakon’s armor, it got the message and withdrew. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s still out there,” Lee warned us during announcements. “Twenty arrows in
                        its hide, and we
                        just made it mad. The thing was thirty feet long and bright green. Its eyes—” He shuddered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You did well, Lee.” Chiron patted him on the shoulder. “Everyone stay alert,
                        but stay calm.
                        This has happened before.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Aye,” Quintus said from the head table. “And it will happen again. More and
                        more frequently.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The campers murmured among themselves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Everyone knew the rumors: Luke and his army of monsters were planning an
                        invasion of the camp.
                        Most of us expected it to happen this summer, but no one knew how or when. It didn’t help that
                        our attendance
                        was down. We only had about eighty campers. Three years ago, when I’d started, there had been
                        more than a
                        hundred. Some had died. Some had joined Luke. Some had just disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is a good reason for new war games,” Quintus continued, a glint in his
                        eyes. “We’ll see
                        how you all do with that tonight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes…” Chiron said. “Well, enough announcements. Let us bless this meal and
                        eat.” He raised his
                        goblet. “To the gods!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We all raised our glasses and repeated the blessing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson and I took our plates to the bronze brazier and scraped a portion of our
                        food into the
                        flames. I hoped the gods liked raisin toast and Fruit Loops. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Poseidon,” I said. Then I whispered, “Help me with Nico, and Luke, and
                        Grover’s problem…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was so much to worry about I could’ve stood there all morning, but I
                        headed back to my
                        table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Once everyone was eating, Chiron and Grover came over to visit. Grover was
                        bleary-eyed. His
                        shirt was inside out. He slid his plate onto the table and slumped next to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson shifted uncomfortably. “I will go…um…polish my fish ponies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He lumbered off, leaving his breakfast half eaten. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron tried for a smile. He probably wanted to look reassuring, but in centaur
                        form he towered
                        over me, casting a shadow across the table. “Well, Percy, how did you sleep?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh, fine.” I wondered why he asked that. Was it possible he knew something
                        about the weird
                        Iris-message I’d gotten? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I brought Grover over,” Chiron said, “because I thought you two might want to,
                        ah, discuss
                        matters. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some Iris-messages to send. I’ll see you later in the
                        day.” He gave
                        Grover a meaningful look, then trotted out of the pavilion. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s he talking about?” I asked Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover chewed his eggs. I could tell he was distracted, because he bit off the
                        tines of his
                        fork and chewed those down, too. “He wants you to convince me,” he mumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Somebody else slid next to me on the bench: Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll tell you what it’s about,” she said. “The Labyrinth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was hard to concentrate on what she was saying, because everybody in the
                        dining pavilion was
                        stealing glances at us and whispering. And Annabeth was right next to me. I mean <i
                            class="calibre5">right
                        </i>next to me. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re not supposed to be here,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We need to talk,” she insisted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But the rules…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She knew as well as I did that campers weren’t allowed to switch tables. Satyrs
                        were different.
                        They weren’t really demigods. But the half-bloods had to sit with their cabins. I wasn’t even
                        sure what the
                        punishment was for switching tables. I’d never seen it happen. If Mr. D had been here, he
                        probably would’ve
                        strangled Annabeth with magical grapevines or something, but Mr. D wasn’t here. Chiron had
                        already left the
                        pavilion. Quintus looked over and raised an eyebrow, but he didn’t say anything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look,” Annabeth said, “Grover is in trouble. There’s only one way we can
                        figure to help him.
                        It’s the Labyrinth. That’s what Clarisse and I have been investigating.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shifted my weight, trying to think clearly. “You mean the maze where they
                        kept the Minotaur,
                        back in the old days?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Exactly,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So…it’s not under the king’s palace in Crete anymore,” I guessed. “The
                        Labyrinth is under some
                        building in America.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">See? It only took me a few years to figure things out. I knew that important
                        places moved
                        around with Western Civilization, like Mount Olympus being over the Empire State Building, and
                        the Underworld
                        entrance being in Los Angeles. I was feeling pretty proud of myself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth rolled her eyes. “Under a building? Please, Percy. The Labyrinth is <i
                            class="calibre5">huge</i>. It wouldn’t fit under a single city, much less a single
                        building.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about my dream of Nico at the River Styx. “So…is the Labyrinth part
                        of the
                        Underworld?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No.” Annabeth frowned. “Well, there may be passages from the Labyrinth down <i
                            class="calibre5">into </i>the Underworld. I’m not sure. But the Underworld is way, way down.
                        The Labyrinth
                        is right under the surface of the mortal world, kind of like a second skin. It’s been growing
                        for thousands of
                        years, lacing its way under Western cities, connecting everything together underground. You can
                        get anywhere
                        through the Labyrinth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If you don’t get lost,” Grover muttered. “And die a horrible death.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover, there has to be a way,” Annabeth said. I got the feeling they’d had
                        this conversation
                        before. “Clarisse lived.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Barely!” Grover said. “And the other guy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He was driven insane. He didn’t die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, joy.” Grover’s lower lip quivered. “That makes me feel much better.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa,” I said. “Back up. What’s this about Clarisse and a crazy guy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth glanced over toward the Ares table. Clarisse was watching us like she
                        knew what we
                        were talking about, but then she fixed her eyes on her breakfast plate. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Last year,” Annabeth said, lowering her voice, “Clarisse went on a mission for
                        Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I remember,” I said. “It was secret.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth nodded. Despite how serious she was acting, I was happy she wasn’t mad
                        at me anymore.
                        And I kind of liked the fact that she’d broken the rules to come sit next to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It was secret,” Annabeth agreed, “because she found Chris Rodriguez.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The guy from the Hermes cabin?” I remembered him from two years ago. We’d
                        eavesdropped on
                        Chris Rodriguez aboard Luke’s ship, the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>. Chris was
                        one of the
                        half-bloods who’d abandoned camp and joined the Titan army. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” Annabeth said. “Last summer he just appeared in Phoenix, Arizona, near
                        Clarisse’s mom’s
                        house.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean he just appeared?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He was wandering around the desert, in a hundred and twenty degrees, in full
                        Greek armor,
                        babbling about string.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“String,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’d been driven completely insane. Clarisse brought him back to her mom’s
                        house so the
                        mortals wouldn’t institutionalize him. She tried to nurse him back to health. Chiron came out
                        and interviewed
                        him, but it wasn’t much good. The only thing they got out of him: Luke’s men have been exploring
                        the Labyrinth.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shivered, though I wasn’t sure exactly why. Poor Chris…he hadn’t been that
                        bad a guy. What
                        could’ve driven him mad? I looked at Grover, who was chewing up the rest of his fork. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay,” I asked. “Why were they exploring the Labyrinth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We weren’t sure,” Annabeth said. “That’s why Clarisse went on a scouting
                        expedition. Chiron
                        kept things hushed up because he didn’t want anyone panicking. He got me involved because…well,
                        the Labyrinth
                        has always been one of my favorite subjects. The architecture involved—” Her expression turned a
                        little dreamy.
                        “The builder, Daedalus, was a genius. But the point is, the Labyrinth has entrances everywhere.
                        If Luke could
                        figure out how to navigate it, he could move his army around with incredible speed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Except it’s a maze, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Full of horrible traps,” Grover agreed. “Dead ends. Illusions. Psychotic
                        goat-killing
                        monsters.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But not if you had Ariadne’s string,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“In the old days, Ariadne’s string guided Theseus out of the maze. It was a
                        navigation
                        instrument of some kind, invented by Daedalus. And Chris Rodriguez was mumbling about string.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So Luke is trying to find Ariadne’s string,” I said. “Why? What’s he
                        planning?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shook her head. “I don’t know. I thought maybe he wanted to invade
                        camp through the
                        maze, but that doesn’t make any sense. The closest entrances Clarisse found were in Manhattan,
                        which wouldn’t
                        help Luke get past our borders. Clarisse explored a little way into the tunnels, but…it was very
                        dangerous. She
                        had some close calls. I researched everything I could find about Daedalus. I’m afraid it didn’t
                        help much. I
                        don’t understand exactly what Luke’s planning, but I do know this: the Labyrinth might be the
                        key to Grover’s
                        problem.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked. “You think Pan is underground?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It would explain why he’s been impossible to find.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shuddered. “Satyrs hate going underground. No searcher would ever try
                        going in <i class="calibre5">that </i>place. No flowers. No sunshine. No coffee shops!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But,” Annabeth said, “the Labyrinth can lead you almost anywhere. It reads
                        your thoughts. It
                        was designed to fool you, to trick you and kill you; but if you can make the Labyrinth work <i
                            class="calibre5">for </i>you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It could lead you to the wild god,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I can’t do it.” Grover hugged his stomach. “Just thinking about it makes me
                        want to throw up
                        my silverware.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover, it may be your last chance,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The council is serious. <i class="calibre5">One </i>week or you learn to tap
                        dance!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Over at the head table, Quintus cleared his throat. I got the feeling he didn’t
                        want to make a
                        scene, but Annabeth was really pushing it, sitting at my table so long. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll talk later.” Annabeth squeezed my arm a little too hard. “Convince him,
                        will you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She returned to the Athena table, ignoring all the people who were staring at
                        her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover buried his head in his hands. “I can’t do it, Percy. My searcher’s
                        license. Pan. I’m
                        going to lose it all. I’ll have to start a puppet theater.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t say that! We’ll figure something out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked at me teary-eyed. “Percy, you’re my best friend. You’ve seen me
                        underground. In that
                        Cyclops’s cave. Do you really think I could…” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/3-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">His voice faltered. I remembered the Sea of Monsters, when he’d been stuck in a
                        Cyclops’s cave.
                        He’d never liked underground places to begin with, but now Grover really hated them. Cyclopes
                        gave him the
                        creeps, too. Even Tyson…Grover tried to hide it, but Grover and I could sort of read each
                        other’s emotions
                        because of this empathy link Grover had made between us. I knew how he felt. Grover was
                        terrified of the big
                        guy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have to leave,” Grover said miserably. “Juniper’s waiting for me. It’s a
                        good thing she
                        finds cowards attractive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After he was gone, I looked over at Quintus. He nodded gravely, like we were
                        sharing some dark
                        secret. Then he went back to cutting his sausage with a dagger. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">In the afternoon, I went down to the pegasus stables to visit my friend
                        Blackjack. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">Yo, boss! </i>He capered around in his stall, his black

                    <p class="calibre14">“You know those aren’t good for you, Blackjack.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">I smiled and fed him a handful. Blackjack and I went back a long way. I sort of
                        helped rescue
                        him from Luke’s demon cruise ship a few years ago, and ever since, he insisted on repaying me
                        with favors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">So we got any quests coming up? </i>Blackjack asked. <i
                            class="calibre5">I’m ready to fly, boss! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I patted his nose. “Not sure, man. Everybody keeps talking about underground
                        mazes.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“You may be right, Blackjack. We’ll see.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Blackjack crunched down his sugar cubes. He shook his mane like he was having a
                        sugar seizure.
                        <i class="calibre5">Whoa! Good stuff! Well, boss, you come to your senses and want to fly
                            somewhere, just give a

                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told him I’d keep it in mind. Then a group of younger campers came into the
                        stables to start
                        their riding lessons, and I decided it was time to leave. I had a bad feeling I wasn’t going to
                        see Blackjack
                        for a long time. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">That night after dinner, Quintus had us suit up in combat armor like we were
                        getting ready for
                        capture the flag, but the mood among the campers was a lot more serious. Sometime during the day
                        the crates in
                        the arena had disappeared, and I had a feeling whatever was in them had been emptied into the
                        woods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Right,” Quintus said, standing on the head dining table. “Gather ’round.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was dressed in black leather and bronze. In the torchlight, his gray hair
                        made him look like
                        a ghost. Mrs. O’Leary bounded happily around him, foraging for dinner scraps. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“You will be in teams of two,” Quintus announced. When everybody started
                        talking and trying to
                        grab their friends, he yelled: “Which have already been chosen!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“AWWWWW!” everybody complained. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your goal is simple: collect the gold laurels without dying. The wreath is

                        holds the laurels. You must find the wreath before the other teams. And, of course…you will have
                        to slay the
                        monster to get it, and stay alive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The crowd started murmuring excitedly. The task sounded pretty straightforward.
                        Hey, we’d all
                        slain monsters before. That’s what we trained for. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I will now announce your partners,” Quintus said. “There will be no trading.
                        No switching. No
                        complaining.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">“Aroooof!” </i>Mrs. O’Leary buried her face in a plate of
                        pizza. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus produced a big scroll and started reading off names. Beckendorf would
                        be with Silena
                        Beauregard, which Beckendorf looked pretty happy about. The Stoll brothers, Travis and Connor,
                        would be
                        together. No surprise. They did everything together. Clarisse was with Lee Fletcher from the
                        Apollo cabin—melee
                        and ranged combat combined, they would be a tough combo to beat. Quintus kept rattling off the
                        names until he
                        said, “Percy Jackson with Annabeth Chase.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nice.” I grinned at Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your armor is crooked” was her only comment, and she redid my straps for me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover Underwood,” Quintus said, “with Tyson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover just about jumped out of his goat fur. “What? B-but—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, no,” Tyson whimpered. “Must be a mistake. Goat boy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No complaining!” Quintus ordered. “Get with your partner. You have two minutes
                        to prepare!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson and Grover both looked at me pleadingly. I tried to give them an
                        encouraging nod, and
                        gestured that they should move together. Tyson sneezed. Grover started chewing nervously on his
                        wooden club.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They’ll be fine,” Annabeth said. “Come on. Let’s worry about how we’re going
                        to stay alive.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">It was still light when we got into the woods, but the shadows from the trees
                        made it feel like
                        midnight. It was cold, too, even in summer. Annabeth and I found tracks almost
                        immediately—scuttling marks made
                        by something with a lot of legs. We began to follow the trail. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We jumped a creek and heard some twigs snapping nearby. We crouched behind a
                        boulder, but it
                        was only the Stoll brothers tripping through the woods and cursing. Their dad was the god of
                        thieves, but they
                        were about as stealthy as water buffaloes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Once the Stolls had passed, we forged deeper into the west woods where the
                        monsters were
                        wilder. We were standing on a ledge overlooking a marshy pond when Annabeth tensed. “This is
                        where we stopped
                        looking.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It took me a second to realize what she meant. Last winter, when we’d been
                        searching for Nico
                        di Angelo, this is where we’d given up hope of finding him. Grover, Annabeth, and I had stood on
                        this rock, and
                        I’d convinced them not to tell Chiron the truth: that Nico was a son of Hades. At the time it
                        seemed the right
                        thing to do. I wanted to protect his identity. I wanted to be the one to find him and make
                        things right for what
                        had happened to his sister. Now, six months later, I hadn’t even come close to finding him. It
                        left a bitter
                        taste in my mouth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I saw him last night,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth knit her eyebrows. “What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told her about the Iris-message. When I was done, she stared into the shadows
                        of the woods.
                        “He’s summoning the dead? That’s not good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The ghost was giving him bad advice,” I said. “Telling him to take revenge.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah…spirits are never good advisers. They’ve got their own agendas. Old
                        grudges. And they
                        resent the living.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s going to come after me,” I said. “The spirit mentioned a maze.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She nodded. “That settles it. We <i class="calibre5">have </i>to figure out the
                        Labyrinth.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe,” I said uncomfortably. “But who sent the Iris-message? If Nico didn’t
                        know I was
                        there—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A branch snapped in the woods. Dry leaves rustled. Something large was moving
                        in the trees,
                        just beyond the ridge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s not the Stoll brothers,” Annabeth whispered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Together we drew our swords. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We got to Zeus’s Fist, a huge pile of boulders in the middle of the west woods.
                        It was a
                        natural landmark where campers often rendezvoused on hunting expeditions, but now there was
                        nobody around. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Over there,” Annabeth whispered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, wait,” I said. “Behind us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was weird. Scuttling noises seemed to be coming from several different
                        directions. We were
                        circling the boulders, our swords drawn, when someone right behind us said, “Hi.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We whirled around, and the tree nymph Juniper yelped. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/3-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Put those down!” she protested. “Dryads don’t like sharp blades, okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Juniper,” Annabeth exhaled. “What are you doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I live here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I lowered my sword. “In the boulders?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pointed toward the edge of the clearing. “In the juniper. Duh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It made sense, and I felt kind of stupid. I’d been hanging around dryads for
                        years, but I never
                        really talked to them much. I knew they couldn’t go very far from their tree, which was their
                        source of life.
                        But I didn’t know much else. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are you guys busy?” Juniper asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well,” I said, “we’re in the middle of this game against a bunch of monsters
                        and we’re trying
                        not to die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re not busy,” Annabeth said. “What’s wrong, Juniper?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper sniffled. She wiped her silky sleeve under her eyes. “It’s Grover. He
                        seems so
                        distraught. All year he’s been out looking for Pan. And every time he comes back, it’s worse. I
                        thought maybe,
                        at first, he was seeing another tree.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” Annabeth said, as Juniper started crying. “I’m sure that’s not it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He had a crush on a blueberry bush once,” Juniper said miserably. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Juniper,” Annabeth said, “Grover would never even <i class="calibre5">look
                        </i>at another
                        tree. He’s just stressed out about his searcher’s license.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He can’t go underground!” she protested. “You can’t let him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth looked uncomfortable. “It might be the only way to help him; if we
                        just knew where to
                        start.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah.” Juniper wiped a green tear off her cheek. “About that…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Another rustle in the woods, and Juniper yelled, “Hide!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I could ask why, she went <i class="calibre5">poof </i>into green mist.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and I turned. Coming out of the woods was a glistening amber insect,
                        ten feet long,
                        with jagged pincers, an armored tail, and a stinger as long as my sword. A scorpion. Tied to its
                        back was a red
                        silk package. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“One of us gets behind it,” Annabeth said, as the thing clattered toward us.
                        “Cuts off its tail
                        while the other distracts it in front.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll take point,” I said. “You’ve got the invisibility hat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She nodded. We’d fought together so many times we knew each other’s moves. We
                        could do this,
                        easy. But it all went wrong when the other two scorpions appeared from the woods. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/3-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">“Three?” </i>Annabeth said. “That’s not possible! The whole
                        woods, and half
                        the monsters come at us?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I swallowed. One, we could take. Two, with a little luck. Three? Doubtful. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The scorpions scurried toward us, whipping their barbed tails like they’d come
                        here just to
                        kill us. Annabeth and I put our backs against the nearest boulder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Climb?” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No time,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was right. The scorpions were already surrounding us. They were so close I
                        could see their
                        hideous mouths foaming, anticipating a nice juicy meal of demigods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look out!” Annabeth parried away a stinger with the flat of her blade. I
                        stabbed with Riptide,
                        but the scorpion backed out of range. We clambered sideways along the boulders, but the
                        scorpions followed us. I
                        slashed at another one, but going on the offensive was too dangerous. If I went for the body,
                        the tail stabbed
                        downward. If I went for the tail, the thing’s pincers came from either side and tried to grab
                        me. All we could
                        do was defend, and we wouldn’t be able to keep that up for very long. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took another step sideways, and suddenly there was nothing behind me. It was
                        a crack between
                        two of the largest boulders, something I’d probably passed by a million times, but…</p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/3-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“In here,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth sliced at a scorpion then looked at me like I was crazy. “<i
                            class="calibre5">In
                            there? </i>It’s too narrow.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll cover you. Go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She ducked behind me and started squeezing between the two boulders. Then she
                        yelped and
                        grabbed my armor straps, and suddenly I was tumbling into a pit that hadn’t been there a moment
                        before. I could
                        see the scorpions above us, the purple evening sky and the trees, and then the hole shut like
                        the lens of a
                        camera, and we were in complete darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Our breathing echoed against stone. It was wet and cold. I was sitting on a
                        bumpy floor that
                        seemed to be made of bricks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I lifted Riptide. The faint glow of the blade was just enough to illuminate
                        Annabeth’s
                        frightened face and the mossy stone walls on either side of us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wh-where are we?” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Safe from scorpions, anyway.” I tried to sound calm, but I was freaking out.
                        The crack between
                        the boulders couldn’t have led into a cave. I would’ve known if there was a cave here; I was
                        sure of it. It was
                        like the ground had opened up and swallowed us. All I could think of was the fissure in the
                        dining room
                        pavilion, where those skeletons had been consumed last summer. I wondered if the same thing had
                        happened to us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I lifted my sword again for light. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s a long room,” I muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth gripped my arm. “It’s not a room. It’s a corridor.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was right. The darkness felt…emptier in front of us. There was a warm
                        breeze, like in
                        subway tunnels, only it felt older, more dangerous somehow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I started forward, but Annabeth stopped me. “Don’t take another step,” she
                        warned. “We need to
                        find the exit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She sounded really scared now. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s okay,” I promised. “It’s right—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked up and realized I couldn’t see where we’d fallen in. The ceiling was
                        solid stone. The
                        corridor seemed to stretch endlessly in both directions. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s hand slipped into mine. Under different circumstances I would’ve
                        been embarrassed,
                        but here in the dark I was glad to know where she was. It was about the only thing I was sure
                        of. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“Two steps back,” she advised. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We stepped backward together like we were in a minefield. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay,” she said. “Help me examine the walls.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The mark of Daedalus,” she said, as if that was supposed to make sense. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh, okay. What kind of—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Got it!” she said with relief. She set her hand on the wall and pressed
                        against a tiny
                        fissure, which began to glow blue. A Greek symbol appeared: Δ, the Ancient Greek Delta. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The roof slid open and we saw night sky, stars blazing. It was a lot darker
                        than it should’ve
                        been. Metal ladder rungs appeared in the side of the wall, leading up, and I could hear people
                        yelling our
                        names. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy! Annabeth!” Tyson’s voice bellowed the loudest, but others were calling
                        out too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked nervously at Annabeth. Then we began to climb. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We made our way around the rocks and ran into Clarisse and a bunch of other
                        campers carrying
                        torches. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where have you two been?” Clarisse demanded. “We’ve been looking forever.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But we were only gone a few minutes,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron trotted up, followed by Tyson and Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Tyson said. “You are okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re fine,” I said. “We fell in a hole.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The others looked at me skeptically, then at Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Honest!” I said. “There were three scorpions after us, so we ran and hid in
                        the rocks. But we
                        were only gone a minute.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve been missing for almost an hour,” Chiron said. “The game is over.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” Grover muttered. “We would’ve won, but a Cyclops sat on me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Was an accident!” Tyson protested, and then he sneezed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse was wearing the gold laurels, but she didn’t even brag about winning
                        them, which
                        wasn’t like her. “A hole?” she said suspiciously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth took a deep breath. She looked around at the other campers.
                        “Chiron…maybe we should
                        talk about this at the Big House.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse gasped. “You found it, didn’t you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth bit her lip. “I—Yeah. Yeah, we did.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bunch of campers started asking questions, looking about as confused as I
                        was, but Chiron
                        raised his hand for silence. “Tonight is not the right time, and this is not the right place.”
                        He stared at the
                        boulders as if he’d just noticed how dangerous they were. “All of you, back to your cabins. Get
                        some sleep. A
                        game well played, but curfew is past!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a lot of mumbling and complaints, but the campers drifted off,
                        talking among
                        themselves and giving me suspicious looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This explains a lot,” Clarisse said. “It explains what Luke is after.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait a second,” I said. “What do you mean? What did we find?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth turned toward me, her eyes dark with worry. “An entrance to the
                        Labyrinth. An invasion
                        route straight into the heart of the camp.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron had insisted we talk about it in the morning, which was kind of like, <i
                            class="calibre5">Hey, your life’s in mortal danger. Sleep tight! </i>It was hard to fall
                        asleep, but when I
                        finally did, I dreamed of a prison. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I saw a boy in a Greek tunic and sandals crouching alone in a massive stone
                        room. The ceiling
                        was open to the night sky, but the walls were twenty feet high and polished marble, completely
                        smooth. Scattered
                        around the room were wooden crates. Some were cracked and tipped over, as if they’d been flung
                        in there. Bronze
                        tools spilled out of one—a compass, a saw, and a bunch of other things I didn’t recognize. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The boy huddled in the corner, shivering from cold, or maybe fear. He was
                        spattered in mud. His
                        legs, arms, and face were scraped up as if he’d been dragged here along with the boxes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then the double oak doors moaned open. Two guards in bronze armor marched in,
                        holding an old
                        man between them. They flung him to the floor in a battered heap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Father!” The boy ran to him. The man’s robes were in tatters. His hair was
                        streaked with gray,
                        and his beard was long and curly. His nose had been broken. His lips were bloody. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The boy took the old man’s head in his arms. “What did they do to you?” Then he
                        yelled at the
                        guards, “I’ll kill you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There will be no killing today,” a voice said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The guards moved aside. Behind them stood a tall man in white robes. He wore a
                        thin circlet of
                        gold on his head. His beard was pointed like a spear blade. His eyes glittered cruelly. “You
                        helped the Athenian
                        kill my Minotaur, Daedalus. You turned my own daughter against me.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“You did that yourself, Your Majesty,” the old man croaked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A guard planted a kick in the old man’s ribs. He groaned in agony. The young
                        boy cried, “Stop!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You love your maze so much,” the king said, “I have decided to let you stay
                        here. This will be
                        your workshop. Make me new wonders. Amuse me. Every maze needs a monster. You shall be mine!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t fear you,” the old man groaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The king smiled coldly. He locked his eyes on the boy. “But a man cares about
                        his son, eh?
                        Displease me, old man, and the next time my guards inflict a punishment, it will be on him!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The king swept out of the room with his guards, and the doors slammed shut,
                        leaving the boy and
                        his father alone in the darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What will we do?” the boy moaned. “Father, they will kill you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old man swallowed with difficulty. He tried to smile, but it was a gruesome
                        sight with his
                        bloody mouth. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Take heart, my son.” He gazed up at the stars. “I—I will find a way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bar lowered across the doors with a fatal <i class="calibre5">BOOM</i>, and I
                        woke in a cold
                        sweat. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I was still feeling shaky the next morning when Chiron called a war council. We
                        met in the
                        sword arena, which I thought was pretty strange—trying to discuss the fate of the camp while
                        Mrs. O’Leary chewed
                        on a life-size squeaky pink rubber yak. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron and Quintus stood at the front by the weapon racks. Clarisse and
                        Annabeth sat next to
                        each other and led the briefing. Tyson and Grover sat as far away from each other as possible.
                        Also present
                        around the table: Juniper the tree nymph, Silena Beauregard, Travis and Connor Stoll,
                        Beckendorf, Lee Fletcher,
                        even Argus, our hundred-eyed security chief. That’s how I knew it was serious. Argus hardly ever
                        shows up unless
                        something really major is going on. The whole time Annabeth spoke, he kept his hundred blue eyes
                        trained on her
                        so hard his whole body turned bloodshot. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Luke must have known about the Labyrinth entrance,” Annabeth said. “He knew
                        everything about
                        camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought I heard a little pride in her voice, like she still respected the
                        guy, as evil as he
                        was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper cleared her throat. “That’s what I was trying to tell you last night.
                        The cave entrance
                        has been there a long time. Luke used to use it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Silena Beauregard frowned. “You knew about the Labyrinth entrance, and you
                        didn’t say
                        anything?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper’s face turned green. “I didn’t know it was important. Just a cave. I
                        don’t like yucky
                        old caves.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She has good taste,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I wouldn’t have paid any attention except…well, it was Luke.” She blushed a
                        little greener.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover huffed. “Forget what I said about good taste.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Interesting.” Quintus polished his sword as he spoke. “And you believe this
                        young man, Luke,
                        would dare use the Labyrinth as an invasion route?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Definitely,” Clarisse said. “If he could get an army of monsters inside Camp
                        Half-Blood, just
                        pop up in the middle of the woods without having to worry about our magical boundaries, we
                        wouldn’t stand a
                        chance. He could wipe us out easy. He must’ve been planning this for months.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s been sending scouts into the maze,” Annabeth said. “We know
                        because…because we found
                        one.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chris Rodriguez,” Chiron said. He gave Quintus a meaningful look. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah,” Quintus said. “The one in the…Yes. I understand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The one in the what?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse glared at me. “The point is, Luke has been looking for a way to
                        navigate the maze.
                        He’s searching for Daedalus’s workshop.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I remembered my dream the night before—the bloody old man in tattered robes.
                        “The guy who
                        created the maze.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes,” Annabeth said. “The greatest architect, the greatest inventor of all
                        time. If the
                        legends are true, his workshop is in the center of the Labyrinth. He’s the only one who knew how
                        to navigate the
                        maze perfectly. If Luke managed to find the workshop and convince Daedalus to help him, Luke
                        wouldn’t have to
                        fumble around searching for paths, or risk losing his army in the maze’s traps. He could
                        navigate anywhere he
                        wanted—quickly and safely. First to Camp Half-Blood to wipe us out. Then…to Olympus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The arena was silent except for Mrs. O’Leary’s toy yak getting disemboweled: <i
                            class="calibre5">SQUEAK! SQUEAK! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally Beckendorf put his huge hands on the table. “Back up a sec. Annabeth,
                        you said
                        ‘convince Daedalus’? Isn’t Daedalus dead?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus grunted. “I would hope so. He lived, what, three thousand years ago?
                        And even if he
                        were alive, don’t the old stories say he fled from the Labyrinth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron clopped restlessly on his hooves. “That’s the problem, my dear Quintus.
                        No one knows.
                        There are rumors…well, there are <i class="calibre5">many </i>disturbing rumors about Daedalus,
                        but one is that
                        he disappeared back into the Labyrinth toward the end of his life. He might still be down
                        there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about the old man I’d seen in my dream. He’d looked so frail, it was
                        hard to believe
                        he’d last another week, much less three thousand years. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We need to go in,” Annabeth announced. “We have to find the workshop before
                        Luke does. If
                        Daedalus is alive, we convince him to help us, not Luke. If Ariadne’s string still exists, we
                        make sure it never
                        falls into Luke’s hands.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait a second,” I said. “If we’re worried about an attack, why not just blow
                        up the entrance?
                        Seal the tunnel?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Great idea!” Grover said. “I’ll get the dynamite!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s not so easy, stupid,” Clarisse growled. “We tried that at the entrance we
                        found in
                        Phoenix. It didn’t go well.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth nodded. “The Labyrinth is magical architecture, Percy. It would take
                        huge power to
                        seal even one of its entrances. In Phoenix, Clarisse demolished a whole building with a wrecking
                        ball, and the
                        maze entrance just shifted a few feet. The best we can do is prevent Luke from learning to
                        navigate the
                        Labyrinth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We could fight,” Lee Fletcher said. “We know where the entrance is now. We can
                        set up a
                        defensive line and wait for them. If an army tries to come through, they’ll find us waiting with
                        our bows.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We will certainly set up defenses,” Chiron agreed. “But I fear Clarisse is
                        right. The magical
                        borders have kept this camp safe for hundreds of years. If Luke manages to get a large army of
                        monsters into the
                        center of camp, bypassing our boundaries…we may not have the strength to defeat them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody looked real happy about that news. Chiron usually tried to be upbeat and
                        optimistic. If
                        he was predicting we couldn’t hold off an attack, that wasn’t good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We have to get to Daedalus’s workshop first,” Annabeth insisted. “Find
                        Ariadne’s string and
                        prevent Luke from using it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But if nobody can navigate in there,” I said, “what chance do we have?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve been studying architecture for years,” she said. “I know Daedalus’s
                        Labyrinth better than
                        anybody.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“From reading about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s not enough.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It has to be!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It isn’t!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are you going to help me or not?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I realized everyone was watching Annabeth and me like a tennis match. Mrs.
                        O’Leary’s squeaky
                        yak went <i class="calibre5">EEK! </i>as she ripped off its pink rubber head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron cleared his throat. “First things first. We need a quest. Someone must
                        enter the
                        Labyrinth, find the workshop of Daedalus, and prevent Luke from using the maze to invade this
                        camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We all know who should lead this,” Clarisse said. “Annabeth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a murmur of agreement. I knew Annabeth had been waiting for her own
                        quest since she
                        was a little kid, but she looked uncomfortable. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve done as much as I have, Clarisse,” she said. “You should go, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse shook her head. “I’m not going back in there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Travis Stoll laughed. “Don’t tell me you’re scared. Clarisse, chicken?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse got to her feet. I thought she was going to pulverize Travis, but she
                        said in a shaky
                        voice: “You don’t understand anything, punk. I’m never going in there again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Never!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She stormed out of the arena. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Travis looked around sheepishly. “I didn’t mean to—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron raised his hand. “The poor girl has had a difficult year. Now, do we
                        have agreement that
                        Annabeth should lead the quest?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We all nodded except Quintus. He folded his arms and stared at the table, but I
                        wasn’t sure
                        anyone else noticed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Very well.” Chiron turned to Annabeth. “My dear, it’s your time to visit the
                        Oracle. Assuming
                        you return to us in one piece, we shall discuss what to do next.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Waiting for Annabeth was harder than visiting the Oracle myself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d heard it speak prophecies twice before. The first time had been in the
                        dusty attic of the
                        Big House, where the spirit of Delphi slept inside the body of a mummified hippie lady. The
                        second time, the
                        Oracle had come out for a little stroll in the woods. I still had nightmares about that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d never felt threatened by the Oracle’s presence, but I’d heard stories:
                        campers who’d gone
                        insane, or who’d seen visions so real they died of fear. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I paced the arena, waiting. Mrs. O’Leary ate her lunch, which consisted of a
                        hundred pounds of
                        ground beef and several dog biscuits the size of trash-can lids. I wondered where Quintus got
                        dog biscuits that
                        size. I didn’t figure you could just walk into Pet Zone and put those in your shopping cart.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron was deep in conversation with Quintus and Argus. It looked to me like
                        they were
                        disagreeing about something. Quintus kept shaking his head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">On the other side of the arena, Tyson and the Stoll brothers were racing
                        miniature bronze
                        chariots that Tyson had made out of armor scraps. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I gave up on pacing and left the arena. I stared across the fields at the Big
                        House’s attic
                        window, dark and still. What was taking Annabeth so long? I was pretty sure it hadn’t taken me
                        this long to get
                        my quest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” a girl whispered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper was standing in the bushes. It was weird how she almost turned
                        invisible when she was
                        surrounded by plants. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She gestured me over urgently. “You need to know: Luke wasn’t the only one I
                        saw around that
                        cave.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She glanced back at the arena. “I was trying to say something, but he was right
                        there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The sword master,” she said. “He was poking around the rocks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My stomach clenched. “Quintus? When?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know. I don’t pay attention to time. Maybe a week ago, when he first
                        showed up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What was he doing? Did he go in?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I’m not sure. He’s creepy, Percy. I didn’t even see him come into the glade.
                        Suddenly he was
                        just <i class="calibre5">there</i>. You have to tell Grover it’s too dangerous—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Juniper?” Grover called from inside the arena. “Where’d you go?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Juniper sighed. “I’d better go in. Just remember what I said. Don’t trust that
                        man!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She ran into the arena. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the Big House, feeling more uneasy than ever. If Quintus was up to
                        something…I
                        needed Annabeth’s advice. She might know what to make of Juniper’s news. But where the heck was
                        she? Whatever
                        was happening with the Oracle, it shouldn’t be taking this long. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally I couldn’t stand it anymore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was against the rules, but then again, nobody was watching. I ran down the
                        hill and headed
                        across the fields. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The front parlor of the Big House was strangely quiet. I was used to seeing
                        Dionysus by the
                        fireplace, playing cards and eating grapes and griping at satyrs, but Mr. D was still away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I walked down the hallway, floorboards creaking under my feet. When I got to
                        the base of the
                        stairs, I hesitated. Four floors above would be a little trapdoor leading to the attic. Annabeth
                        would be up
                        there somewhere. I stood quietly and listened. But what I heard wasn’t what I had expected. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Sobbing. And it was coming from below me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I crept around the back of the stairs. The basement door was open. I didn’t
                        even know the Big
                        House <i class="calibre5">had </i>a basement. I peered inside and saw two figures in the far
                        corner, sitting
                        amid a bunch of stockpiled cases of ambrosia and strawberry preserves. One was Clarisse. The
                        other was a teenage
                        Hispanic guy in tattered camouflage pants and a dirty black T-shirt. His hair was greasy and
                        matted. He was
                        hugging his shoulders and sobbing. It was Chris Rodriguez, the half-blood who’d gone to work for
                        Luke. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s okay,” Clarisse was telling him. “Try a little more nectar.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re an illusion, Mary!” Chris backed farther into the corner. “G-get away.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My name’s not Mary.” Clarisse’s voice was gentle but really sad. I never knew
                        Clarisse could
                        sound that way. “My name is Clarisse. Remember. Please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s dark!” Chris yelled. “So dark!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come outside,” Clarisse coaxed. “The sunlight will help you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A…a thousand skulls. The earth keeps healing him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chris,” Clarisse pleaded. It sounded like she was close to tears. “You have to
                        get better.
                        Please. Mr. D will be back soon. He’s an expert in madness. Just hang on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chris’s eyes were like a cornered rat’s—wild and desperate. “There’s no way
                        out, Mary. No way
                        out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then he caught a glimpse of me and made a strangled, terrified sound. “The son
                        of Poseidon!
                        He’s horrible!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I backed away, hoping Clarisse hadn’t seen me. I listened for her to come
                        charging out and yell
                        at me, but instead she just kept talking to Chris in a sad pleading voice, trying to get him to
                        drink the
                        nectar. Maybe she thought it was part of Chris’s hallucination, but…<i class="calibre5">son of
                            Poseidon</i>?
                        Chris had been looking at me, and yet why did I get the feeling he hadn’t been talking about me
                        at all? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And Clarisse’s tenderness—it had never even occurred to me that she might like
                        someone; but the
                        way she said Chris’s name…She’d known him before he changed sides. She’d known him a lot better
                        than I realized.
                        And now he was shivering in a dark basement, afraid to come out, and mumbling about someone
                        named Mary. No
                        wonder Clarisse didn’t want anything to do with the Labyrinth. What had happened to Chris in
                        there? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I heard a creak from above—like the attic door opening— and I ran for the front
                        door. I needed
                        to get out of that house. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“My dear,” Chiron said. “You made it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth walked into the arena. She sat on a stone bench and stared at the
                        floor. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well?” Quintus asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth looked at me first. I couldn’t tell if she was trying to warn me, or
                        if the look in
                        her eyes was just plain fear. Then she focused on Quintus. “I got the prophecy. I will lead the
                        quest to find
                        Daedalus’s workshop.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody cheered. I mean, we all liked Annabeth, and we wanted her to have a
                        quest, but this one
                        seemed insanely dangerous. After what I’d seen of Chris Rodriguez, I didn’t even want to think
                        about Annabeth
                        descending into that weird maze again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron scraped a hoof on the dirt floor. “What did the prophecy say exactly, my
                        dear? The
                        wording is important.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth took a deep breath. “I, ah…well, it said, <i class="calibre5">You
                            shall delve in the
                            darkness of the endless maze</i>…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We waited. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i>“The dead, the traitor, and the lost one raise.”</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover perked up. “The lost one! That must mean Pan! That’s great!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“With the dead and the traitor,” I added. “Not so great.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And?” Chiron asked. “What is the rest?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><i class="calibre5">“You shall rise or fall by the ghost king’s hand,”
                        </i>Annabeth said, <i class="calibre5">“the child of Athena’s final stand.” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Everyone looked around uncomfortably. Annabeth was a daughter of Athena, and a
                        final stand
                        didn’t sound good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey…we shouldn’t jump to conclusions,” Silena said. “Annabeth isn’t the only
                        child of Athena,
                        right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But who’s this ghost king?” Beckendorf asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No one answered. I thought about the Iris-message I’d seen of Nico summoning
                        spirits. I had a
                        bad feeling the prophecy was connected to that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are there more lines?” Chiron asked. “The prophecy does not sound complete.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth hesitated. “I don’t remember exactly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron raised an eyebrow. Annabeth was known for her memory. She never forgot
                        something she
                        heard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shifted on her bench. “Something about…<i class="calibre5">Destroy
                            with a hero’s final
                            breath</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And?” Chiron asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She stood. “Look, the point is, I have to go in. I’ll find the workshop and
                        stop Luke. And…I
                        need help.” She turned to me. “Will you come?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t even hesitate. “I’m in.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She smiled for the first time in days, and that made it all worthwhile.
                        “Grover, you too? The
                        wild god is waiting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover seemed to forget how much he hated the underground. The line about the
                        “lost one” had
                        completely energized him. “I’ll pack extra recyclables for snacks!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And Tyson,” Annabeth said. “I’ll need you too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yay! Blow-things-up time!” Tyson clapped so hard he woke up Mrs. O’Leary, who
                        was dozing in
                        the corner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait, Annabeth,” Chiron said. “This goes against the ancient laws. A hero is
                        allowed only two
                        companions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I need them all,” she insisted. “Chiron, it’s important.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know why she was so certain, but I was happy she’d included Tyson. I
                        couldn’t imagine
                        leaving him behind. He was huge and strong and great at figuring out mechanical things. Unlike
                        satyrs, Cyclopes
                        had no problem underground. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Annabeth.” Chiron flicked his tail nervously. “Consider well. You would be
                        breaking the
                        ancient laws, and there are always consequences. Last winter, five went on a quest to save
                        Artemis. Only three
                        came back. Think on that. Three is a sacred number. There are three Fates, three Furies, three
                        Olympian sons of
                        Kronos. It is a good strong number that stands against many dangers. Four…this is risky.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth took a deep breath. “I know. But we have to. Please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could tell Chiron didn’t like it. Quintus was studying us, like he was trying
                        to decide which
                        of us would come back alive. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron sighed. “Very well. Let us adjourn. The members of the quest must
                        prepare themselves.
                        Tomorrow at dawn, we send you into the Labyrinth.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Quintus pulled me aside as the council was breaking up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have a bad feeling about this,” he told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. O’Leary came over, wagging her tail happily. She dropped her shield at my
                        feet, and I
                        threw it for her. Quintus watched her romp after it. I remembered what Juniper had said about
                        him scouting out
                        the maze. I didn’t trust him, but when he looked at me, I saw real concern in his eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t like the idea of you going down there,” he said. “Any of you. But if
                        you must, I want
                        you to remember something. The Labyrinth exists to fool you. It will distract you. That’s
                        dangerous for
                        half-bloods. We are easily distracted.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve been in there?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Long ago.” His voice was ragged. “I barely escaped with my life. Most who
                        enter aren’t that
                        lucky.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gripped my shoulder. “Percy, keep your mind on what matters most. If you can
                        do that, you
                        might find the way. And here, I wanted to give you something.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-4-scenes/4-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">He handed me a little silver tube. It was so cold I almost dropped it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A whistle?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A dog whistle,” Quintus said. “For Mrs. O’Leary.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um, thanks, but—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How will it work in the maze? I’m not a hundred percent certain it will. But
                        Mrs. O’Leary is a
                        hellhound. She can appear when called, no matter how far away she is. I’d feel better knowing
                        you had this. If
                        you really need help, use it; but be careful, the whistle is made of Stygian ice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<i class="calibre5">What </i>ice?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“From the River Styx. Very hard to craft. Very delicate. It cannot melt, but it
                        will shatter
                        when you blow it, so you can only use it once.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about Luke, my old enemy. Right before I’d gone on my first quest,
                        Luke had given me
                        a gift, too— magic shoes that had been designed to drag me to my death. Quintus seemed so nice.
                        So concerned.
                        And Mrs. O’Leary liked him, which had to count for something. She dropped the slimy shield at my
                        feet and barked
                        excitedly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt ashamed that I could even think about mistrusting Quintus. But then
                        again, I’d trusted
                        Luke once. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thanks,” I told Quintus. I slipped the freezing whistle into my pocket,
                        promising myself that
                        I would never use it, and I dashed off to find Annabeth. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">As long as I’d been at camp, I’d never been inside the Athena cabin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was a silvery building, nothing fancy, with plain white curtains and a
                        carved stone owl over
                        the doorway. The owl’s onyx eyes seemed to follow me as I walked closer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hello?” I called inside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody answered. I stepped in and caught my breath. The place was a workshop
                        for brainiac kids.
                        The bunks were all pushed against one wall as if sleeping didn’t matter very much. Most of the
                        room was filled
                        with workbenches and tables and sets of tools and weapons. The back of the room was a huge
                        library crammed with
                        old scrolls and leather-bound books and paperbacks. There was an architect’s drafting table with
                        a bunch of
                        rulers and protractors, and some 3-D models of buildings. Huge old war maps were plastered to
                        the ceiling. Sets
                        of armor hung under the windows, their bronze plates glinting in the sun. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stood in the back of the room, rifling through old scrolls. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Knock, knock?” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She turned with a start. “Oh…hi. Didn’t hear you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She frowned at the scroll in her hands. “Just trying to do some research.
                        Daedalus’s Labyrinth
                        is so huge. None of the stories agree about anything. The maps just lead from nowhere to
                        nowhere.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about what Quintus had said, how the maze tries to distract you. I
                        wondered if
                        Annabeth knew that already. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll figure it out,” I promised. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her hair had come loose and was hanging in a tangled blond curtain all around
                        her face. Her
                        gray eyes looked almost black. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve wanted to lead a quest since I was seven,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re going to do awesome.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked at me gratefully, but then stared down at all the books and scrolls
                        she’d pulled
                        from the shelves. “I’m worried, Percy. Maybe I shouldn’t have asked you to do this. Or Tyson and
                        Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, we’re your friends. We wouldn’t miss it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But…” She stopped herself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What is it?” I asked. “The prophecy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sure it’s fine,” she said in a small voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What was the last line?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she did something that really surprised me. She blinked back tears and put
                        out her arms.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stepped forward and hugged her. Butterflies started turning my stomach into a
                        mosh pit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, it’s…it’s okay.” I patted her back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was aware of everything in the room. I felt like I could read the tiniest
                        print on any book
                        on the shelves. Annabeth’s hair smelled like lemon soap. She was shivering. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chiron might be right,” she muttered. “I’m breaking the rules. But I don’t
                        know what else to
                        do. I need you three. It just feels right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then don’t worry about it,” I managed. “We’ve had plenty of problems before,
                        and we solved
                        them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is different. I don’t want anything happening to…any of you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind me, somebody cleared his throat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was one of Annabeth’s half-brothers, Malcolm. His face was bright red. “Um,
                        sorry,” he said.
                        “Archery practice is starting, Annabeth. Chiron said to come find you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stepped away from Annabeth. “We were just looking at maps,” I said stupidly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Malcolm stared at me. “Okay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tell Chiron I’ll be right there,” Annabeth said, and Malcolm left in a hurry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth rubbed her eyes. “You go ahead, Percy. I’d better get ready for
                        archery.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded, feeling more confused than I ever had in my life. I wanted to run
                        from the cabin…but
                        then again I didn’t. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Annabeth?” I said. “About your prophecy. The line about a hero’s last breath—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re wondering which hero? I don’t know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. Something else. I was thinking the last line usually rhymes with the one
                        before it. Was it
                        something about—did it end in the word <i class="calibre5">death</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stared down at her scrolls. “You’d better go, Percy. Get ready for the
                        quest.
                        I’ll—I’ll see you in the morning.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I left her there, staring at maps that led from nowhere to nowhere; but I
                        couldn’t shake the
                        feeling that one of us wasn’t going to come back from this quest alive. </p>
