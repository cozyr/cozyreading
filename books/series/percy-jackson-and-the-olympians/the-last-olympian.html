                    <p class="no-indent">The end of the world started when a pegasus landed on the hood of my car. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Up until then, I was having a great afternoon. Technically I wasn’t supposed to
                        be driving
                        because I wouldn’t turn sixteen for another week, but my mom and my stepdad, Paul, took my
                        friend Rachel and me
                        to this private stretch of beach on the South Shore, and Paul let us borrow his Prius for a
                        short spin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Now, I know you’re thinking, <i class="calibre5">Wow, that was really
                            irrespon</i><i class="calibre5">sible of him, blah, blah, blah, </i>but Paul knows me pretty
                        well. He’s seen me slice up
                        demons and leap out of exploding school buildings, so he probably figured taking a car a few
                        hundred yards
                        wasn’t exactly the most dangerous thing I’d ever done. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Anyway, Rachel and I were driving along. It was a hot August day. Rachel’s red
                        hair was pulled
                        back in a ponytail and she wore a white blouse over her swimsuit. I’d never seen her in anything
                        but ratty
                        T-shirts and paint-splattered jeans before, and she looked like a million golden drachma. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, pull up right there!” she told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We parked on a ridge overlooking the Atlantic. The sea is always one of my
                        favorite places, but
                        today it was especially nice—glittery green and smooth as glass, like my dad was keeping it calm
                        just for us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My dad, by the way, is Poseidon. He can do stuff like that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So.” Rachel smiled at me. “About that invitation.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh…right.” I tried to sound excited. I mean, she’d asked me to her family’s
                        vacation house on
                        St. Thomas for three days. I didn’t get a lot of offers like that. My family’s idea of a fancy
                        vacation was a
                        weekend in a rundown cabin on Long Island with some movie rentals and a couple of frozen pizzas,
                        and here
                        Rachel’s folks were willing to let me tag along to the Caribbean. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Besides, I seriously needed a vacation. This summer had been the hardest of my
                        life. The idea
                        of taking a break even for a few days was really tempting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Still, something big was supposed to go down any day now. I was “on call” for a
                        mission. Even
                        worse, next week was my birthday. There was this prophecy that said when I turned sixteen, bad
                        things would
                        happen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy,” she said, “I know the timing is bad. But it’s <i
                            class="calibre5">always </i>bad for
                        you, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She had a point. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I really want to go,” I promised. “It’s just—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The war.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nodded. I didn’t like talking about it, but Rachel knew. Unlike most mortals,
                        she could see
                        through the Mist—the magic veil that distorts human vision. She’d seen monsters. She’d met some
                        of the other
                        demigods who were fighting the Titans and their allies. She’d even been there last summer when
                        the chopped-up
                        Lord Kronos rose out of his coffin in a terrible new form, and she’d earned my permanent respect
                        by nailing him
                        in the eye with a blue plastic hairbrush. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She put her hand on my arm. “Just think about it, okay? We don’t leave for a
                        couple of days. My
                        dad…” Her voice faltered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Is he giving you a hard time?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Rachel shook her head in disgust. “He’s trying to be <i class="calibre5">nice
                        </i>to me, which
                        is almost worse. He wants me to go to Clarion Ladies Academy in the fall.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The school where your mom went?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It’s a stupid finishing school for society girls, all the way in New
                        Hampshire. Can you see me
                        in finishing school?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I admitted the idea sounded pretty dumb. Rachel was into urban art projects and
                        feeding the
                        homeless and going to protest rallies to “Save the Endangered Yellow-bellied Sapsucker” and
                        stuff like that. I’d
                        never even seen her wear a dress. It was hard to imagine her learning to be a socialite. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She sighed. “He thinks if he does a bunch of nice stuff for me, I’ll feel
                        guilty and give in.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Which is why he agreed to let me come with you guys on vacation?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Yes…but Percy, you’d be doing me a huge favor. It would be <i
                            class="calibre5">so </i>much
                        better if you were with us. Besides, there’s something I want to talk—” She stopped abruptly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Something you want to talk about?” I asked. “You mean…so serious we’d have to
                        go to St. Thomas
                        to talk about it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She pursed her lips. “Look, just forget it for now. Let’s pretend we’re a
                        couple of normal
                        people. We’re out for a drive, and we’re watching the ocean, and it’s nice to be together.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I could tell something was bothering her, but she put on a brave smile. The
                        sunlight made her
                        hair look like fire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We’d spent a lot of time together this summer. I hadn’t exactly planned it that
                        way, but the
                        more serious things got at camp, the more I found myself needing to call up Rachel and get away,
                        just for some
                        breathing room. I needed to remind myself that the mortal world was still out there, away from
                        all the monsters
                        using me as their personal punching bag. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Okay,” I said. “Just a normal afternoon and two normal people.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She nodded. “And so…hypothetically, if these two people liked each other, what
                        would it take to
                        get the stupid guy to kiss the girl, huh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh…” I felt like one of Apollo’s sacred cows—slow, dumb, and bright red. “Um…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can’t pretend I hadn’t thought about Rachel. She was so much easier to be
                        around than…well,
                        than some other girls I knew. I didn’t have to work hard, or watch what I said, or rack my brain
                        trying to
                        figure out what she was thinking. Rachel didn’t hide much. She let you know how she felt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I’m not sure what I would’ve done, but I was so distracted, I didn’t notice the
                        huge black form
                        swooping down from the sky until four hooves landed on the hood of the Prius with a <i
                            class="calibre5">WUMP-WUMP-CRUNCH! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Hey, boss</i>, a voice said in my head. <i
                            class="calibre5">Nice car! </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Blackjack the pegasus was an old friend of mine, so I tried not to get too
                        annoyed by the
                        craters he’d just put in the hood; but I didn’t think my stepdad would be real stoked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Blackjack,” I sighed. “What are you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then I saw who was riding on his back, and I knew my day was about to get a lot
                        more
                        complicated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“’Sup, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Charles Beckendorf, senior counselor for the Hephaestus cabin, would make most
                        monsters cry for
                        their mommies. He was this huge African American guy with ripped muscles from working in the
                        forges every
                        summer. He was two years older than me, and one of the camp’s best armorsmiths. He made some
                        seriously ingenious
                        mechanical stuff. A month before, he’d rigged a Greek firebomb in the bathroom of a tour bus
                        that was carrying a
                        bunch of monsters across country. The explosion took out a whole legion of Kronos’s evil meanies
                        as soon as the
                        first harpy went <i class="calibre5">flush</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf was dressed for combat. He wore a bronze breastplate and war helm
                        with black camo
                        pants and a sword strapped to his side. His explosives bag was slung over his shoulder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Time?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He nodded grimly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A clump formed in my throat. I’d known this was coming. We’d been planning it
                        for weeks, but
                        I’d half hoped it would never happen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Rachel looked up at Beckendorf. “Hi.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, hey. I’m Beckendorf. You must be Rachel. Percy’s told me…uh, I mean he
                        mentioned you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Rachel raised an eyebrow. “Really? Good.” She glanced at Blackjack, who was
                        clopping his hooves
                        against the hood of the Prius. “So I guess you guys have to go save the world now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Pretty much,” Beckendorf agreed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I looked at Rachel helplessly. “Would you tell my mom—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’ll tell her. I’m sure she’s used to it. And I’ll explain to Paul about the
                        hood.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nodded my thanks. I figured this might be the last time Paul loaned me his
                        car. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Good luck.” Rachel kissed me before I could even react. “Now, get going,
                        half-blood. Go kill
                        some monsters for me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My last view of her was sitting in the shotgun seat of the Prius, her arms
                        crossed, watching as
                        Blackjack circled higher and higher, carrying Beckendorf and me into the sky. I wondered what
                        Rachel wanted to
                        talk to me about, and whether I’d live long enough to find out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So,” Beckendorf said, “I’m guessing you don’t want me to mention that little
                        scene to
                        Annabeth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, gods,” I muttered. “Don’t even think about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf chuckled, and together we soared out over the Atlantic. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">It was almost dark by the time we spotted our target. The <i
                            class="calibre5">Princess
                            Andromeda </i>glowed on the horizon—a huge cruise ship lit up yellow and white. From a
                        distance, you’d think
                        it was just a party ship, not the headquarters for the Titan lord. Then as you got closer, you
                        might notice the
                        giant masthead—a dark-haired maiden in a Greek chiton, wrapped in chains with a look of horror
                        on her face, as
                        if she could smell the stench of all the monsters she was being forced to carry. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Seeing the ship again twisted my gut into knots. I’d almost died twice on the
                        <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>. Now it was heading straight for New York.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You know what to do?” Beckendorf yelled over the wind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nodded. We’d done dry runs at the dockyards in New Jersey, using abandoned
                        ships as our
                        targets. I knew how little time we would have. But I also knew this was our best chance to end
                        Kronos’s invasion
                        before it ever started. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Blackjack,” I said, “set us down on the lowest stern deck.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Gotcha, boss</i>, he said. <i class="calibre5">Man, I hate
                            seeing that
                            boat. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Three years ago, Blackjack had been enslaved on the <i
                            class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda
                        </i>until he’d escaped with a little help from my friends and me. I figured he’d rather have his
                        mane braided
                        like My Little Pony than be back here again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Don’t wait for us,” I told him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">But, boss— </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Trust me,” I said. “We’ll get out by ourselves.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Blackjack folded his wings and plummeted toward the boat like a black comet.
                        The wind whistled
                        in my ears. I saw monsters patrolling the upper decks of the ship—<i class="calibre5">dracaenae
                        </i>snake-women,
                        hellhounds, giants, and the humanoid seal-demons known as telkhines—but we zipped by so fast,
                        none of them
                        raised the alarm. We shot down the stern of the boat, and Blackjack spread his wings, lightly
                        coming to a
                        landing on the lowest deck. I climbed off, feeling queasy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Good luck, boss</i>, Blackjack said. <i
                            class="calibre5">Don’t let ’em turn
                            you into horse meat! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">With that, my old friend flew off into the night. I took my pen out of my
                        pocket, uncapped it,
                        and Riptide sprang to full size—three feet of deadly Celestial bronze glowing in the dusk. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf pulled a piece of paper of out his pocket. I thought it was a map or
                        something. Then
                        I realized it was a photograph. He stared at it in the dim light—the smiling face of Silena
                        Beauregard, daughter
                        of Aphrodite. They’d started going out last summer, after years of the rest of us saying, “Duh,
                        you guys like
                        each other!” Even with all the dangerous missions, Beckendorf had been happier this summer than
                        I’d ever seen
                        him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We’ll make it back to camp,” I promised. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For a second I saw worry in his eyes. Then he put on his old confident smile.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You bet,” he said. “Let’s go blow Kronos back into a million pieces.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf led the way. We followed a narrow corridor to the service stairwell,
                        just like we’d
                        practiced, but we froze when we heard noises above us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I don’t care what your nose says!” snarled a half-human, half-dog voice—a
                        telkhine. “The last
                        time you smelled half-blood, it turned out to be a meat loaf sandwich!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Meat loaf sandwiches are good!” a second voice snarled. “But this is
                        half-blood scent, I
                        swear. They are on board!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Bah, your <i class="calibre5">brain </i>isn’t on board!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They continued to argue, and Beckendorf pointed downstairs. We descended as
                        quietly as we
                        could. Two floors down, the voices of the telkhines started to fade. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Finally we came to a metal hatch. Beckendorf mouthed the words <i
                            class="calibre5">engine
                            room</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It was locked, but Beckendorf pulled some chain cutters out of his bag and
                        split the bolt like
                        it was made of butter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Inside, a row of yellow turbines the size of grain silos churned and hummed.
                        Pressure gauges
                        and computer terminals lined the opposite wall. A telkhine was hunched over a console, but he
                        was so involved
                        with his work, he didn’t notice us. He was about five feet tall, with slick black seal fur and
                        stubby little
                        feet. He had the head of a Doberman, but his clawed hands were almost human. He growled and
                        muttered as he
                        tapped on his keyboard. Maybe he was messaging his friends on uglyface.com. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stepped forward, and he tensed, probably smelling something was wrong. He
                        leaped sideways
                        toward a big red alarm button, but I blocked his path. He hissed and lunged at me, but one slice
                        of Riptide, and
                        he exploded into dust. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“One down,” Beckendorf said. “About five thousand to go.” He tossed me a jar of
                        thick green
                        liquid—Greek fire, one of the most dangerous magical substances in the world. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then he threw me another essential tool of demigod heroes—duct tape. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Slap that one on the console,” he said. “I’ll get the turbines.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We went to work. The room was hot and humid, and in no time we were drenched in
                        sweat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The boat kept chugging along. Being the son of Poseidon and all, I have perfect
                        bearings at
                        sea. Don’t ask me how, but I could tell we were at 40.19° North, 71.90° West, making eighteen
                        knots, which meant
                        the ship would arrive in New York Harbor by dawn. This would be our only chance to stop it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I had just attached a second jar of Greek fire to the control panels when I
                        heard the pounding
                        of feet on metal steps—so many creatures coming down the stairwell I could hear them over the
                        engines. Not a
                        good sign. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I locked eyes with Beckendorf. “How much longer?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Too long.” He tapped his watch, which was our remote control detonator. “I
                        still have to wire
                        the receiver and prime the charges. Ten more minutes at least.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Judging from the sound of the footsteps, we had about ten seconds. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’ll distract them,” I said. “Meet you at the rendezvous point.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Wish me luck.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He looked like he wanted to argue. The whole idea had been to get in and out
                        without being
                        spotted. But we were going to have to improvise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Good luck,” he said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I charged out the door. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">A half dozen telkhines were tromping down the stairs. I cut through them with
                        Riptide faster
                        than they could yelp. I kept climbing—past another telkhine, who was so startled he dropped his
                        Lil’ Demons
                        lunch box. I left him alive— partly because his lunch box was cool, partly so he could raise the
                        alarm and
                        hopefully get his friends to follow me rather than head toward the engine room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I burst through a door onto deck six and kept running. I’m sure the carpeted
                        hall had once been
                        very plush, but over the last three years of monster occupation the wallpaper, carpet, and
                        stateroom doors had
                        been clawed up and slimed so it looked like the inside of a dragon’s throat (and yes,
                        unfortunately, I speak
                        from experience). </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Back on my first visit to the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>, my
                        old enemy Luke had
                        kept some dazed tourists on board for show, shrouded in Mist so they didn’t realize they were on
                        a
                        monster-infested ship. Now I didn’t see any sign of tourists. I hated to think what had happened
                        to them, but I
                        kind of doubted they’d been allowed to go home with their bingo winnings. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I reached the promenade, a big shopping mall that took up the whole middle of
                        the ship, and I
                        stopped cold. In the middle of the courtyard stood a fountain. And in the fountain squatted a
                        giant crab. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I’m not talking <i class="calibre5">giant </i>like $7.99 all-you-can-eat
                        Alaskan king crab. I’m
                        talking <i class="calibre5">giant </i>like bigger than the fountain. The monster rose ten feet
                        out of the water.
                        Its shell was mottled blue and green, its pincers longer than my body. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">If you’ve ever seen a crab’s mouth, all foamy and gross with whiskers and
                        snapping bits, you
                        can imagine this one didn’t look any better blown up to billboard size. Its beady black eyes
                        glared at me, and I
                        could see intelligence in them—and hate. The fact that I was the son of the sea god was not
                        going to win me any
                        points with Mr. Crabby. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“FFFFfffffff,” </i>it hissed, sea foam dripping from its
                        mouth. The smell
                        coming off it was like a garbage can full of fish sticks that had been sitting in the sun all
                        week. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alarms blared. Soon I was going to have lots of company and I had to keep
                        moving. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Hey, crabby.” I inched around the edge of the courtyard. “I’m just gonna scoot
                        around you so—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The crab moved with amazing speed. It scuttled out of the fountain and came
                        straight at me,
                        pincers snapping. I dove into a gift shop, plowing through a rack of T-shirts. A crab pincer
                        smashed the glass
                        walls to pieces and raked across the room. I dashed back outside, breathing heavily, but Mr.
                        Crabby turned and
                        followed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“There!” a voice said from a balcony above me. “Intruder!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">If I’d wanted to create a distraction, I’d succeeded, but this was not where I
                        wanted to fight.
                        If I got pinned down in the center of the ship, I was crab chow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The demonic crustacean lunged at me. I sliced with Riptide, taking off the tip
                        of its claw. It
                        hissed and foamed, but didn’t seem very hurt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I tried to remember anything from the old stories that might help with this
                        thing. Annabeth had
                        told me about a monster crab—something about Hercules crushing it under his foot? That wasn’t
                        going to work
                        here. This crab was slightly bigger than my Reeboks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then a weird thought came to me. Last Christmas, my mom and I had brought Paul
                        Blofis to our
                        old cabin at Montauk, where we’d been going forever. Paul had taken me crabbing, and when he’d
                        brought up a net
                        full of the things, he’d shown me how crabs have a chink in their armor, right in the middle of
                        their ugly
                        bellies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The only problem was getting to the ugly belly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glanced at the fountain, then at the marble floor, already slick from
                        scuttling crab tracks.
                        I held out my hand, concentrating on the water, and the fountain exploded. Water sprayed
                        everywhere, three
                        stories high, dousing the balconies and the elevators and the windows of the shops. The crab
                        didn’t care. He
                        loved water. He came at me sideways, snapping and hissing, and I ran straight at him, screaming,
                        “AHHHHHHH!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Just before we collided, I hit the ground baseball-style and slid on the wet
                        marble floor
                        straight under him. It was like sliding under a seven-ton armored vehicle. All the crab had to
                        do was sit and
                        squash me, but before he realized what was going on, I jabbed Riptide into the chink in his
                        armor, let go of the
                        hilt, and pushed myself out the backside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The monster shuddered and hissed. His eyes dissolved. His shell turned bright
                        red as his
                        insides evaporated. The empty shell clattered to the floor in a massive heap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t have time to admire my handiwork. I ran for the nearest stairs while
                        all around me
                        monsters and demigods shouted orders and strapped on their weapons. I was empty-handed. Riptide,
                        being magic,
                        would appear in my pocket sooner or later, but for now it was stuck somewhere under the wreckage
                        of the crab,
                        and I had no time to retrieve it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">In the elevator foyer on deck eight, a couple of <i class="calibre5">dracaenae
                        </i>slithered
                        across my path. From the waist up, they were women with green scaly skin, yellow eyes, and
                        forked tongues. From
                        the waist down, they had double snake trunks instead of legs. They held spears and weighted
                        nets, and I knew
                        from experience they could use them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What isss thisss?” one said. “A prize for Kronosss!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wasn’t in the mood to play break-the-snake, but in front of me was a stand
                        with a model of
                        the ship, like a YOU ARE HERE display. I ripped the model off the pedestal and hurled it at the
                        first <i class="calibre5">dracaena</i>. The boat smacked her in her face and she went down with
                        the ship. I jumped
                        over her, grabbed her friend’s spear, and swung her around. She slammed into the elevator, and I
                        kept running
                        toward the front of the ship. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Get him!” she screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hellhounds bayed. An arrow from somewhere whizzed past my face and impaled
                        itself in the
                        mahogany-paneled wall of the stairwell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t care—as long as I got the monsters away from the engine room and gave
                        Beckendorf more
                        time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">As I was running up the stairwell, a kid charged down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He looked like he’d just woken up from a nap. His armor was half on. He drew
                        his sword and
                        yelled, “Kronos!” but he sounded more scared than angry. He couldn’t have been more than
                        twelve—about the same
                        age I was when I first went to Camp Half-Blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">That thought depressed me. This kid was getting brain-washed—trained to hate
                        the gods and lash
                        out because he’d been born half Olympian. Kronos was using him, and yet the kid thought I was
                        his enemy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">No way was I going to hurt him. I didn’t need a weapon for this. I stepped
                        inside his strike
                        and grabbed his wrist, slamming it against the wall. His sword clattered out of his hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then I did something I hadn’t planned on. It was probably stupid. It definitely
                        jeopardized our
                        mission, but I couldn’t help it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“If you want to live,” I told him, “get off this ship <i
                            class="calibre5">now</i>. Tell the
                        other demigods.” Then I shoved him downstairs and sent him tumbling to the next floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I kept climbing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Bad memories: a hallway ran past the cafeteria. Annabeth, my half brother
                        Tyson, and I had
                        sneaked through here three years ago on my first visit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I burst outside onto the main deck. Off the port bow, the sky was darkening
                        from purple to
                        black. A swimming pool glowed between two glass towers with more balconies and restaurant decks.
                        The whole upper
                        ship seemed eerily deserted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">All I had to do was cross to the other side. Then I could take the staircase
                        down to the
                        helipad—our emergency rendezvous point. With any luck, Beckendorf would meet me there. We’d jump
                        into the sea.
                        My water powers would protect us both, and we’d detonate the charges from a quarter mile away.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was halfway across the deck when the sound of a voice made me freeze. “You’re
                        late, Percy.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Luke stood on the balcony above me, a smile on his scarred face. He wore jeans,
                        a white
                        T-shirt, and flip-flops, like he was just a normal college-age guy, but his eyes told the truth.
                        They were solid
                        gold. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We’ve been expecting you for days.” At first he sounded normal, like Luke. But
                        then his face
                        twitched. A shudder passed through his body like he’d just drunk something really nasty. His
                        voice became
                        heavier, ancient, and powerful—the voice of the Titan lord Kronos. The words scraped down my
                        spine like a knife
                        blade. “Come, bow before me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Yeah, that’ll happen,” I muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Laistrygonian giants filed in on either side of the swimming pool as if they’d
                        been waiting for
                        a cue. Each was eight feet tall with tattooed arms, leather armor, and spiked clubs. Demigod
                        archers appeared on
                        the roof above Luke. Two hellhounds leaped down from the opposite balcony and snarled at me.
                        Within seconds I
                        was surrounded. A trap: there’s no way they could’ve gotten into position so fast unless they’d
                        known I was
                        coming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I looked up at Luke, and anger boiled inside me. I didn’t know if Luke’s
                        consciousness was even
                        still alive inside that body. Maybe, the way his voice had changed…or maybe it was just Kronos
                        adapting to his
                        new form. I told myself it didn’t matter. Luke had been twisted and evil long before Kronos
                        possessed him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A voice in my head said: <i class="calibre5">I have to fight him eventually.
                            Why not now? </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">According to that big prophecy, I was supposed to make a choice that saved or
                        destroyed the
                        world when I was sixteen. That was only seven days away. Why not now? If I really had the power,
                        what difference
                        would a week make? I could end this threat right here by taking down Kronos. Hey, I’d fought
                        monsters and gods
                        before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">As if reading my thoughts, Luke smiled. No, he was <i
                            class="calibre5">Kronos</i>. I had to
                        remember that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Come forward,” he said. “If you dare.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The crowd of monsters parted. I moved up the stairs, my heart pounding. I was
                        sure somebody
                        would stab me in the back, but they let me pass. I felt my pocket and found my pen waiting. I
                        uncapped it, and
                        Riptide grew into a sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos’s weapon appeared in his hands—a six-footlong scythe, half Celestial
                        bronze, half mortal
                        steel. Just looking at the thing made my knees turn to Jell-O. But before I could change my
                        mind, I charged.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Time slowed down. I mean <i class="calibre5">literally </i>slowed down, because
                        Kronos had that
                        power. I felt like I was moving through syrup. My arms were so heavy, I could barely raise my
                        sword. Kronos
                        smiled, swirling his scythe at normal speed and waiting for me to creep toward my death. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I tried to fight his magic. I concentrated on the sea around me—the source of
                        my power. I’d
                        gotten better at channeling it over the years, but now nothing seemed to happen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I took another slow step forward. Giants jeered. <i class="calibre5">Dracaenae
                        </i>hissed with
                        laughter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Hey, ocean</i>, I pleaded. <i class="calibre5">Any day now
                            would be good.
                        </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Suddenly there was a wrenching pain in my gut. The entire boat lurched
                        sideways, throwing
                        monsters off their feet. Four thousand gallons of salt water surged out of the swimming pool,
                        dousing me and
                        Kronos and everyone on the deck. The water revitalized me, breaking the time spell, and I lunged
                        forward. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I struck at Kronos, but I was still too slow. I made the mistake of looking at
                        his face—<i class="calibre5">Luke’s face</i>—a guy who was once my friend. As much as I hated
                        him, it was hard to kill
                        him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos had no such hesitation. He sliced downward with his scythe. I leaped
                        back, and the evil
                        blade missed by an inch, cutting a gash in the deck right between my feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I kicked Kronos in the chest. He stumbled backward, but he was heavier than
                        Luke should’ve
                        been. It was like kicking a refrigerator. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos swung his scythe again. I intercepted with Riptide, but his strike was
                        so powerful, my
                        blade could only deflect it. The edge of the scythe shaved off my shirtsleeve and grazed my arm.
                        It shouldn’t
                        have been a serious cut, but the entire side of my body exploded with pain. I remembered what a
                        sea demon had
                        once said about Kronos’s scythe: <i class="calibre5">Careful, fool. One touch, and the blade
                            will sever your
                            soul from </i><i class="calibre5">your body</i>. Now I understood what he meant. I wasn’t
                        just losing blood.
                        I could feel my strength, my will, my identity draining away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stumbled backward, switched my sword to my left hand, and lunged desperately.
                        My blade
                        should’ve run him through, but it deflected off his stomach like I was hitting solid marble.
                        There was no way he
                        should’ve survived that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos laughed. “A poor performance, Percy Jackson. Luke tells me you were
                        never his match at
                        swordplay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My vision started to blur. I knew I didn’t have much time. “Luke had a big
                        head,” I said. “But
                        at least it was <i class="calibre5">his </i>head.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“A shame to kill you now,” Kronos mused, “before the final plan unfolds. I
                        would love to see
                        the terror in your eyes when you realize how I will destroy Olympus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You’ll never get this boat to Manhattan.” My arm was throbbing. Black spots
                        danced in my eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“And why would that be?” Kronos’s golden eyes glittered. His face—Luke’s
                        face—seemed like a
                        mask, unnatural and lit from behind by some evil power. “Perhaps you are counting on your friend
                        with the
                        explosives?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He looked down at the pool and called, “Nakamura!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A teenage guy in full Greek armor pushed through the crowd. His left eye was
                        covered with a
                        black patch. I knew him, of course: Ethan Nakamura, the son of Nemesis. I’d saved his life in
                        the Labyrinth last
                        summer, and in return, the little punk had helped Kronos come back to life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Success, my lord,” Ethan called. “We found him just as we were told.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He clapped his hands, and two giants lumbered forward, dragging Charles
                        Beckendorf between
                        them. My heart almost stopped. Beckendorf had a swollen eye and cuts all over his face and arms.
                        His armor was
                        gone and his shirt was nearly torn off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf met my eyes. He glanced at his hand like he was trying to tell me
                        something. <i class="calibre5">His watch. </i>They hadn’t taken it yet, and that was the
                        detonator. Was it possible the
                        explosives were armed? Surely the monsters would’ve dismantled them right away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We found him amidships,” one of the giants said, “trying to sneak to the
                        engine room. Can we
                        eat him now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Soon.” Kronos scowled at Ethan. “Are you sure he didn’t set the explosives?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“He was going <i class="calibre5">toward </i>the engine room, my lord.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“How do you know that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Er…” Ethan shifted uncomfortably. “He was heading in that direction. And he
                        told us. His bag
                        is still full of explosives.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Slowly, I began to understand. Beckendorf had fooled them. When he’d realized
                        he was going to
                        be captured, he turned to make it look like he was going the other way. He’d convinced them he
                        hadn’t made it to
                        the engine room yet. The Greek fire might still be primed! But that didn’t do us any good unless
                        we could get
                        off the ship and detonate it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos hesitated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Buy the story</i>, I prayed. The pain in my arm was so bad
                        now I could
                        barely stand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Open his bag,” Kronos ordered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">One of the giants ripped the explosives satchel from Beckendorf’s shoulders. He
                        peered inside,
                        grunted, and turned it upside down. Panicked monsters surged backward. If the bag really had
                        been full of Greek
                        fire jars, we would’ve all blown up. But what fell out were a dozen cans of peaches. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I could hear Kronos breathing, trying to control his anger. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Did you, perhaps,” he said, “capture this demigod near the galley?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Ethan turned pale. “Um—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“And did you, perhaps, send someone to actually CHECK THE ENGINE ROOM?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Ethan scrambled back in terror, then turned on his heels and ran. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I cursed silently. Now we had only minutes before the bombs were disarmed. I
                        caught
                        Beckendorf’s eyes again and asked a silent question, hoping he would understand: <i
                            class="calibre5">How long?
                        </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He cupped his fingers and thumb, making a circle. <i class="calibre5">ZERO.
                        </i>There was no
                        delay on the timer at all. If he managed to press the detonator button, the ship would blow at
                        once. We’d never
                        be able to get far enough away before using it. The monsters would kill us first, or disarm the
                        explosives, or
                        both. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos turned toward me with a crooked smile. “You’ll have to excuse my
                        incompetent help, Percy
                        Jackson, but it doesn’t matter. We have you now. We’ve known you were coming for weeks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He held out his hand and dangled a little silver bracelet with a scythe
                        charm—the Titan lord’s
                        symbol. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The wound in my arm was sapping my ability to think, but I muttered,
                        “Communication device…spy
                        at camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos chuckled. “You can’t count on friends. They will always let you down.
                        Luke learned that
                        lesson the hard way. Now drop your sword and surrender to me, or your friend dies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I swallowed. One of the giants had his hand around Beckendorf’s neck. I was in
                        no shape to
                        rescue him, and even if I tried, he would die before I got there. We both would. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf mouthed one word: <i class="calibre5">Go. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shook my head. I couldn’t just leave him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The second giant was still rummaging through the peach cans, which meant
                        Beckendorf’s left arm
                        was free. He raised it slowly—toward the watch on his right wrist. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wanted to scream, <i class="calibre5">NO! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then down by the swimming pool, one of the <i class="calibre5">dracaenae
                        </i>hissed, “What isss
                        he doing? What isss that on hisss wrissst?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf closed eyes tight and brought his hand up to his watch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I had no choice. I threw my sword like a javelin at Kronos. It bounced
                        harmlessly off his
                        chest, but it did startle him. I pushed through a crowd of monsters and jumped off the side of
                        the ship—toward
                        the water a hundred feet below. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I heard rumbling deep in the ship. Monsters yelled at me from above. A spear
                        sailed past my
                        ear. An arrow pierced my thigh, but I barely had time to register the pain. I plunged into the
                        sea and willed
                        the currents to take me far, far away—a hundred yards, two hundred yards. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Even from that distance, the explosion shook the world. Heat seared the back of
                        my head. The <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda </i>blew up from both sides, a massive
                        fireball of green flame roiling
                        into the dark sky, consuming everything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf, I thought. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then I blacked out and sank like an anchor toward the bottom of the sea. </p>
