                    <p class="no-indent">The end of the world started when a pegasus landed on the hood of my car. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Up until then, I was having a great afternoon. Technically I wasn’t supposed to
                        be driving
                        because I wouldn’t turn sixteen for another week, but my mom and my stepdad, Paul, took my
                        friend Rachel and me
                        to this private stretch of beach on the South Shore, and Paul let us borrow his Prius for a
                        short spin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Now, I know you’re thinking, <i class="calibre5">Wow, that was really
                            irrespon</i><i class="calibre5">sible of him, blah, blah, blah, </i>but Paul knows me pretty
                        well. He’s seen me slice up
                        demons and leap out of exploding school buildings, so he probably figured taking a car a few
                        hundred yards
                        wasn’t exactly the most dangerous thing I’d ever done. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Anyway, Rachel and I were driving along. It was a hot August day. Rachel’s red
                        hair was pulled
                        back in a ponytail and she wore a white blouse over her swimsuit. I’d never seen her in anything
                        but ratty
                        T-shirts and paint-splattered jeans before, and she looked like a million golden drachma. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, pull up right there!” she told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We parked on a ridge overlooking the Atlantic. The sea is always one of my
                        favorite places, but
                        today it was especially nice—glittery green and smooth as glass, like my dad was keeping it calm
                        just for us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My dad, by the way, is Poseidon. He can do stuff like that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So.” Rachel smiled at me. “About that invitation.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh…right.” I tried to sound excited. I mean, she’d asked me to her family’s
                        vacation house on
                        St. Thomas for three days. I didn’t get a lot of offers like that. My family’s idea of a fancy
                        vacation was a
                        weekend in a rundown cabin on Long Island with some movie rentals and a couple of frozen pizzas,
                        and here
                        Rachel’s folks were willing to let me tag along to the Caribbean. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Besides, I seriously needed a vacation. This summer had been the hardest of my
                        life. The idea
                        of taking a break even for a few days was really tempting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Still, something big was supposed to go down any day now. I was “on call” for a
                        mission. Even
                        worse, next week was my birthday. There was this prophecy that said when I turned sixteen, bad
                        things would
                        happen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy,” she said, “I know the timing is bad. But it’s <i
                            class="calibre5">always </i>bad for
                        you, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She had a point. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I really want to go,” I promised. “It’s just—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The war.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nodded. I didn’t like talking about it, but Rachel knew. Unlike most mortals,
                        she could see
                        through the Mist—the magic veil that distorts human vision. She’d seen monsters. She’d met some
                        of the other
                        demigods who were fighting the Titans and their allies. She’d even been there last summer when
                        the chopped-up
                        Lord Kronos rose out of his coffin in a terrible new form, and she’d earned my permanent respect
                        by nailing him
                        in the eye with a blue plastic hairbrush. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She put her hand on my arm. “Just think about it, okay? We don’t leave for a
                        couple of days. My
                        dad…” Her voice faltered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Is he giving you a hard time?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Rachel shook her head in disgust. “He’s trying to be <i class="calibre5">nice
                        </i>to me, which
                        is almost worse. He wants me to go to Clarion Ladies Academy in the fall.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The school where your mom went?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It’s a stupid finishing school for society girls, all the way in New
                        Hampshire. Can you see me
                        in finishing school?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I admitted the idea sounded pretty dumb. Rachel was into urban art projects and
                        feeding the
                        homeless and going to protest rallies to “Save the Endangered Yellow-bellied Sapsucker” and
                        stuff like that. I’d
                        never even seen her wear a dress. It was hard to imagine her learning to be a socialite. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She sighed. “He thinks if he does a bunch of nice stuff for me, I’ll feel
                        guilty and give in.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Which is why he agreed to let me come with you guys on vacation?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Yes…but Percy, you’d be doing me a huge favor. It would be <i
                            class="calibre5">so </i>much
                        better if you were with us. Besides, there’s something I want to talk—” She stopped abruptly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Something you want to talk about?” I asked. “You mean…so serious we’d have to
                        go to St. Thomas
                        to talk about it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She pursed her lips. “Look, just forget it for now. Let’s pretend we’re a
                        couple of normal
                        people. We’re out for a drive, and we’re watching the ocean, and it’s nice to be together.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I could tell something was bothering her, but she put on a brave smile. The
                        sunlight made her
                        hair look like fire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We’d spent a lot of time together this summer. I hadn’t exactly planned it that
                        way, but the
                        more serious things got at camp, the more I found myself needing to call up Rachel and get away,
                        just for some
                        breathing room. I needed to remind myself that the mortal world was still out there, away from
                        all the monsters
                        using me as their personal punching bag. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Okay,” I said. “Just a normal afternoon and two normal people.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She nodded. “And so…hypothetically, if these two people liked each other, what
                        would it take to
                        get the stupid guy to kiss the girl, huh?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/1-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh…” I felt like one of Apollo’s sacred cows—slow, dumb, and bright red. “Um…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I can’t pretend I hadn’t thought about Rachel. She was so much easier to be
                        around than…well,
                        than some other girls I knew. I didn’t have to work hard, or watch what I said, or rack my brain
                        trying to
                        figure out what she was thinking. Rachel didn’t hide much. She let you know how she felt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I’m not sure what I would’ve done, but I was so distracted, I didn’t notice the
                        huge black form
                        swooping down from the sky until four hooves landed on the hood of the Prius with a <i
                            class="calibre5">WUMP-WUMP-CRUNCH! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Hey, boss</i>, a voice said in my head. <i
                            class="calibre5">Nice car! </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Blackjack the pegasus was an old friend of mine, so I tried not to get too
                        annoyed by the
                        craters he’d just put in the hood; but I didn’t think my stepdad would be real stoked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Blackjack,” I sighed. “What are you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then I saw who was riding on his back, and I knew my day was about to get a lot
                        more
                        complicated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“’Sup, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Charles Beckendorf, senior counselor for the Hephaestus cabin, would make most
                        monsters cry for
                        their mommies. He was this huge African American guy with ripped muscles from working in the
                        forges every
                        summer. He was two years older than me, and one of the camp’s best armorsmiths. He made some
                        seriously ingenious
                        mechanical stuff. A month before, he’d rigged a Greek firebomb in the bathroom of a tour bus
                        that was carrying a
                        bunch of monsters across country. The explosion took out a whole legion of Kronos’s evil meanies
                        as soon as the
                        first harpy went <i class="calibre5">flush</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf was dressed for combat. He wore a bronze breastplate and war helm
                        with black camo
                        pants and a sword strapped to his side. His explosives bag was slung over his shoulder. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Time?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He nodded grimly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A clump formed in my throat. I’d known this was coming. We’d been planning it
                        for weeks, but
                        I’d half hoped it would never happen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Rachel looked up at Beckendorf. “Hi.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, hey. I’m Beckendorf. You must be Rachel. Percy’s told me…uh, I mean he
                        mentioned you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Rachel raised an eyebrow. “Really? Good.” She glanced at Blackjack, who was
                        clopping his hooves
                        against the hood of the Prius. “So I guess you guys have to go save the world now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Pretty much,” Beckendorf agreed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I looked at Rachel helplessly. “Would you tell my mom—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’ll tell her. I’m sure she’s used to it. And I’ll explain to Paul about the
                        hood.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nodded my thanks. I figured this might be the last time Paul loaned me his
                        car. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Good luck.” Rachel kissed me before I could even react. “Now, get going,
                        half-blood. Go kill
                        some monsters for me.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/1-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">My last view of her was sitting in the shotgun seat of the Prius, her arms
                        crossed, watching as
                        Blackjack circled higher and higher, carrying Beckendorf and me into the sky. I wondered what
                        Rachel wanted to
                        talk to me about, and whether I’d live long enough to find out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So,” Beckendorf said, “I’m guessing you don’t want me to mention that little
                        scene to
                        Annabeth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, gods,” I muttered. “Don’t even think about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf chuckled, and together we soared out over the Atlantic. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">It was almost dark by the time we spotted our target. The <i
                            class="calibre5">Princess
                            Andromeda </i>glowed on the horizon—a huge cruise ship lit up yellow and white. From a
                        distance, you’d think
                        it was just a party ship, not the headquarters for the Titan lord. Then as you got closer, you
                        might notice the
                        giant masthead—a dark-haired maiden in a Greek chiton, wrapped in chains with a look of horror
                        on her face, as
                        if she could smell the stench of all the monsters she was being forced to carry. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/1-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Seeing the ship again twisted my gut into knots. I’d almost died twice on the
                        <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>. Now it was heading straight for New York.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You know what to do?” Beckendorf yelled over the wind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nodded. We’d done dry runs at the dockyards in New Jersey, using abandoned
                        ships as our
                        targets. I knew how little time we would have. But I also knew this was our best chance to end
                        Kronos’s invasion
                        before it ever started. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Blackjack,” I said, “set us down on the lowest stern deck.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Gotcha, boss</i>, he said. <i class="calibre5">Man, I hate
                            seeing that
                            boat. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Three years ago, Blackjack had been enslaved on the <i
                            class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda
                        </i>until he’d escaped with a little help from my friends and me. I figured he’d rather have his
                        mane braided
                        like My Little Pony than be back here again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Don’t wait for us,” I told him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">But, boss— </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Trust me,” I said. “We’ll get out by ourselves.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Blackjack folded his wings and plummeted toward the boat like a black comet.
                        The wind whistled
                        in my ears. I saw monsters patrolling the upper decks of the ship—<i class="calibre5">dracaenae
                        </i>snake-women,
                        hellhounds, giants, and the humanoid seal-demons known as telkhines—but we zipped by so fast,
                        none of them
                        raised the alarm. We shot down the stern of the boat, and Blackjack spread his wings, lightly
                        coming to a
                        landing on the lowest deck. I climbed off, feeling queasy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Good luck, boss</i>, Blackjack said. <i
                            class="calibre5">Don’t let ’em turn
                            you into horse meat! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">With that, my old friend flew off into the night. I took my pen out of my
                        pocket, uncapped it,
                        and Riptide sprang to full size—three feet of deadly Celestial bronze glowing in the dusk. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/1-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf pulled a piece of paper of out his pocket. I thought it was a map or
                        something. Then
                        I realized it was a photograph. He stared at it in the dim light—the smiling face of Silena
                        Beauregard, daughter
                        of Aphrodite. They’d started going out last summer, after years of the rest of us saying, “Duh,
                        you guys like
                        each other!” Even with all the dangerous missions, Beckendorf had been happier this summer than
                        I’d ever seen
                        him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We’ll make it back to camp,” I promised. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For a second I saw worry in his eyes. Then he put on his old confident smile.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You bet,” he said. “Let’s go blow Kronos back into a million pieces.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf led the way. We followed a narrow corridor to the service stairwell,
                        just like we’d
                        practiced, but we froze when we heard noises above us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I don’t care what your nose says!” snarled a half-human, half-dog voice—a
                        telkhine. “The last
                        time you smelled half-blood, it turned out to be a meat loaf sandwich!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Meat loaf sandwiches are good!” a second voice snarled. “But this is
                        half-blood scent, I
                        swear. They are on board!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Bah, your <i class="calibre5">brain </i>isn’t on board!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">They continued to argue, and Beckendorf pointed downstairs. We descended as
                        quietly as we
                        could. Two floors down, the voices of the telkhines started to fade. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Finally we came to a metal hatch. Beckendorf mouthed the words <i
                            class="calibre5">engine
                            room</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It was locked, but Beckendorf pulled some chain cutters out of his bag and
                        split the bolt like
                        it was made of butter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Inside, a row of yellow turbines the size of grain silos churned and hummed.
                        Pressure gauges
                        and computer terminals lined the opposite wall. A telkhine was hunched over a console, but he
                        was so involved
                        with his work, he didn’t notice us. He was about five feet tall, with slick black seal fur and
                        stubby little
                        feet. He had the head of a Doberman, but his clawed hands were almost human. He growled and
                        muttered as he
                        tapped on his keyboard. Maybe he was messaging his friends on uglyface.com. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/1-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">I stepped forward, and he tensed, probably smelling something was wrong. He
                        leaped sideways
                        toward a big red alarm button, but I blocked his path. He hissed and lunged at me, but one slice
                        of Riptide, and
                        he exploded into dust. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“One down,” Beckendorf said. “About five thousand to go.” He tossed me a jar of
                        thick green
                        liquid—Greek fire, one of the most dangerous magical substances in the world. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then he threw me another essential tool of demigod heroes—duct tape. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Slap that one on the console,” he said. “I’ll get the turbines.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We went to work. The room was hot and humid, and in no time we were drenched in
                        sweat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The boat kept chugging along. Being the son of Poseidon and all, I have perfect
                        bearings at
                        sea. Don’t ask me how, but I could tell we were at 40.19° North, 71.90° West, making eighteen
                        knots, which meant
                        the ship would arrive in New York Harbor by dawn. This would be our only chance to stop it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I had just attached a second jar of Greek fire to the control panels when I
                        heard the pounding
                        of feet on metal steps—so many creatures coming down the stairwell I could hear them over the
                        engines. Not a
                        good sign. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I locked eyes with Beckendorf. “How much longer?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Too long.” He tapped his watch, which was our remote control detonator. “I
                        still have to wire
                        the receiver and prime the charges. Ten more minutes at least.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Judging from the sound of the footsteps, we had about ten seconds. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’ll distract them,” I said. “Meet you at the rendezvous point.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Wish me luck.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He looked like he wanted to argue. The whole idea had been to get in and out
                        without being
                        spotted. But we were going to have to improvise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Good luck,” he said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I charged out the door. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">A half dozen telkhines were tromping down the stairs. I cut through them with
                        Riptide faster
                        than they could yelp. I kept climbing—past another telkhine, who was so startled he dropped his
                        Lil’ Demons
                        lunch box. I left him alive— partly because his lunch box was cool, partly so he could raise the
                        alarm and
                        hopefully get his friends to follow me rather than head toward the engine room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I burst through a door onto deck six and kept running. I’m sure the carpeted
                        hall had once been
                        very plush, but over the last three years of monster occupation the wallpaper, carpet, and
                        stateroom doors had
                        been clawed up and slimed so it looked like the inside of a dragon’s throat (and yes,
                        unfortunately, I speak
                        from experience). </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Back on my first visit to the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>, my
                        old enemy Luke had
                        kept some dazed tourists on board for show, shrouded in Mist so they didn’t realize they were on
                        a
                        monster-infested ship. Now I didn’t see any sign of tourists. I hated to think what had happened
                        to them, but I
                        kind of doubted they’d been allowed to go home with their bingo winnings. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I reached the promenade, a big shopping mall that took up the whole middle of
                        the ship, and I
                        stopped cold. In the middle of the courtyard stood a fountain. And in the fountain squatted a
                        giant crab. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I’m not talking <i class="calibre5">giant </i>like $7.99 all-you-can-eat
                        Alaskan king crab. I’m
                        talking <i class="calibre5">giant </i>like bigger than the fountain. The monster rose ten feet
                        out of the water.
                        Its shell was mottled blue and green, its pincers longer than my body. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">If you’ve ever seen a crab’s mouth, all foamy and gross with whiskers and
                        snapping bits, you
                        can imagine this one didn’t look any better blown up to billboard size. Its beady black eyes
                        glared at me, and I
                        could see intelligence in them—and hate. The fact that I was the son of the sea god was not
                        going to win me any
                        points with Mr. Crabby. </p>

                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“FFFFfffffff,” </i>it hissed, sea foam dripping from its
                        mouth. The smell
                        coming off it was like a garbage can full of fish sticks that had been sitting in the sun all
                        week. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Alarms blared. Soon I was going to have lots of company and I had to keep
                        moving. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Hey, crabby.” I inched around the edge of the courtyard. “I’m just gonna scoot
                        around you so—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The crab moved with amazing speed. It scuttled out of the fountain and came
                        straight at me,
                        pincers snapping. I dove into a gift shop, plowing through a rack of T-shirts. A crab pincer
                        smashed the glass
                        walls to pieces and raked across the room. I dashed back outside, breathing heavily, but Mr.
                        Crabby turned and
                        followed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“There!” a voice said from a balcony above me. “Intruder!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">If I’d wanted to create a distraction, I’d succeeded, but this was not where I
                        wanted to fight.
                        If I got pinned down in the center of the ship, I was crab chow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The demonic crustacean lunged at me. I sliced with Riptide, taking off the tip
                        of its claw. It
                        hissed and foamed, but didn’t seem very hurt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I tried to remember anything from the old stories that might help with this
                        thing. Annabeth had
                        told me about a monster crab—something about Hercules crushing it under his foot? That wasn’t
                        going to work
                        here. This crab was slightly bigger than my Reeboks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then a weird thought came to me. Last Christmas, my mom and I had brought Paul
                        Blofis to our
                        old cabin at Montauk, where we’d been going forever. Paul had taken me crabbing, and when he’d
                        brought up a net
                        full of the things, he’d shown me how crabs have a chink in their armor, right in the middle of
                        their ugly
                        bellies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The only problem was getting to the ugly belly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glanced at the fountain, then at the marble floor, already slick from
                        scuttling crab tracks.
                        I held out my hand, concentrating on the water, and the fountain exploded. Water sprayed
                        everywhere, three
                        stories high, dousing the balconies and the elevators and the windows of the shops. The crab
                        didn’t care. He
                        loved water. He came at me sideways, snapping and hissing, and I ran straight at him, screaming,
                        “AHHHHHHH!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Just before we collided, I hit the ground baseball-style and slid on the wet
                        marble floor
                        straight under him. It was like sliding under a seven-ton armored vehicle. All the crab had to
                        do was sit and
                        squash me, but before he realized what was going on, I jabbed Riptide into the chink in his
                        armor, let go of the
                        hilt, and pushed myself out the backside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The monster shuddered and hissed. His eyes dissolved. His shell turned bright
                        red as his
                        insides evaporated. The empty shell clattered to the floor in a massive heap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t have time to admire my handiwork. I ran for the nearest stairs while
                        all around me
                        monsters and demigods shouted orders and strapped on their weapons. I was empty-handed. Riptide,
                        being magic,
                        would appear in my pocket sooner or later, but for now it was stuck somewhere under the wreckage
                        of the crab,
                        and I had no time to retrieve it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">In the elevator foyer on deck eight, a couple of <i class="calibre5">dracaenae
                        </i>slithered
                        across my path. From the waist up, they were women with green scaly skin, yellow eyes, and
                        forked tongues. From
                        the waist down, they had double snake trunks instead of legs. They held spears and weighted
                        nets, and I knew
                        from experience they could use them. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/1-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“What isss thisss?” one said. “A prize for Kronosss!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wasn’t in the mood to play break-the-snake, but in front of me was a stand
                        with a model of
                        the ship, like a YOU ARE HERE display. I ripped the model off the pedestal and hurled it at the
                        first <i class="calibre5">dracaena</i>. The boat smacked her in her face and she went down with
                        the ship. I jumped
                        over her, grabbed her friend’s spear, and swung her around. She slammed into the elevator, and I
                        kept running
                        toward the front of the ship. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Get him!” she screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hellhounds bayed. An arrow from somewhere whizzed past my face and impaled
                        itself in the
                        mahogany-paneled wall of the stairwell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t care—as long as I got the monsters away from the engine room and gave
                        Beckendorf more
                        time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">As I was running up the stairwell, a kid charged down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He looked like he’d just woken up from a nap. His armor was half on. He drew
                        his sword and
                        yelled, “Kronos!” but he sounded more scared than angry. He couldn’t have been more than
                        twelve—about the same
                        age I was when I first went to Camp Half-Blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">That thought depressed me. This kid was getting brain-washed—trained to hate
                        the gods and lash
                        out because he’d been born half Olympian. Kronos was using him, and yet the kid thought I was
                        his enemy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">No way was I going to hurt him. I didn’t need a weapon for this. I stepped
                        inside his strike
                        and grabbed his wrist, slamming it against the wall. His sword clattered out of his hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then I did something I hadn’t planned on. It was probably stupid. It definitely
                        jeopardized our
                        mission, but I couldn’t help it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“If you want to live,” I told him, “get off this ship <i
                            class="calibre5">now</i>. Tell the
                        other demigods.” Then I shoved him downstairs and sent him tumbling to the next floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I kept climbing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Bad memories: a hallway ran past the cafeteria. Annabeth, my half brother
                        Tyson, and I had
                        sneaked through here three years ago on my first visit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I burst outside onto the main deck. Off the port bow, the sky was darkening
                        from purple to
                        black. A swimming pool glowed between two glass towers with more balconies and restaurant decks.
                        The whole upper
                        ship seemed eerily deserted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">All I had to do was cross to the other side. Then I could take the staircase
                        down to the
                        helipad—our emergency rendezvous point. With any luck, Beckendorf would meet me there. We’d jump
                        into the sea.
                        My water powers would protect us both, and we’d detonate the charges from a quarter mile away.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was halfway across the deck when the sound of a voice made me freeze. “You’re
                        late, Percy.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Luke stood on the balcony above me, a smile on his scarred face. He wore jeans,
                        a white
                        T-shirt, and flip-flops, like he was just a normal college-age guy, but his eyes told the truth.
                        They were solid
                        gold. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We’ve been expecting you for days.” At first he sounded normal, like Luke. But
                        then his face
                        twitched. A shudder passed through his body like he’d just drunk something really nasty. His
                        voice became
                        heavier, ancient, and powerful—the voice of the Titan lord Kronos. The words scraped down my
                        spine like a knife
                        blade. “Come, bow before me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Yeah, that’ll happen,” I muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Laistrygonian giants filed in on either side of the swimming pool as if they’d
                        been waiting for
                        a cue. Each was eight feet tall with tattooed arms, leather armor, and spiked clubs. Demigod
                        archers appeared on
                        the roof above Luke. Two hellhounds leaped down from the opposite balcony and snarled at me.
                        Within seconds I
                        was surrounded. A trap: there’s no way they could’ve gotten into position so fast unless they’d
                        known I was
                        coming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I looked up at Luke, and anger boiled inside me. I didn’t know if Luke’s
                        consciousness was even
                        still alive inside that body. Maybe, the way his voice had changed…or maybe it was just Kronos
                        adapting to his
                        new form. I told myself it didn’t matter. Luke had been twisted and evil long before Kronos
                        possessed him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A voice in my head said: <i class="calibre5">I have to fight him eventually.
                            Why not now? </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">According to that big prophecy, I was supposed to make a choice that saved or
                        destroyed the
                        world when I was sixteen. That was only seven days away. Why not now? If I really had the power,
                        what difference
                        would a week make? I could end this threat right here by taking down Kronos. Hey, I’d fought
                        monsters and gods
                        before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">As if reading my thoughts, Luke smiled. No, he was <i
                            class="calibre5">Kronos</i>. I had to
                        remember that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Come forward,” he said. “If you dare.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The crowd of monsters parted. I moved up the stairs, my heart pounding. I was
                        sure somebody
                        would stab me in the back, but they let me pass. I felt my pocket and found my pen waiting. I
                        uncapped it, and
                        Riptide grew into a sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos’s weapon appeared in his hands—a six-footlong scythe, half Celestial
                        bronze, half mortal
                        steel. Just looking at the thing made my knees turn to Jell-O. But before I could change my
                        mind, I charged.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Time slowed down. I mean <i class="calibre5">literally </i>slowed down, because
                        Kronos had that
                        power. I felt like I was moving through syrup. My arms were so heavy, I could barely raise my
                        sword. Kronos
                        smiled, swirling his scythe at normal speed and waiting for me to creep toward my death. </p>

                    <p class="calibre15">I tried to fight his magic. I concentrated on the sea around me—the source of
                        my power. I’d
                        gotten better at channeling it over the years, but now nothing seemed to happen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I took another slow step forward. Giants jeered. <i class="calibre5">Dracaenae
                        </i>hissed with

                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Hey, ocean</i>, I pleaded. <i class="calibre5">Any day now
                            would be good.
                        </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Suddenly there was a wrenching pain in my gut. The entire boat lurched
                        sideways, throwing
                        monsters off their feet. Four thousand gallons of salt water surged out of the swimming pool,
                        dousing me and
                        Kronos and everyone on the deck. The water revitalized me, breaking the time spell, and I lunged
                        forward. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I struck at Kronos, but I was still too slow. I made the mistake of looking at
                        his face—<i class="calibre5">Luke’s face</i>—a guy who was once my friend. As much as I hated
                        him, it was hard to kill
                        him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos had no such hesitation. He sliced downward with his scythe. I leaped
                        back, and the evil
                        blade missed by an inch, cutting a gash in the deck right between my feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I kicked Kronos in the chest. He stumbled backward, but he was heavier than
                        Luke should’ve
                        been. It was like kicking a refrigerator. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos swung his scythe again. I intercepted with Riptide, but his strike was
                        so powerful, my
                        blade could only deflect it. The edge of the scythe shaved off my shirtsleeve and grazed my arm.
                        It shouldn’t
                        have been a serious cut, but the entire side of my body exploded with pain. I remembered what a
                        sea demon had
                        once said about Kronos’s scythe: <i class="calibre5">Careful, fool. One touch, and the blade
                            will sever your
                            soul from </i><i class="calibre5">your body</i>. Now I understood what he meant. I wasn’t
                        just losing blood.
                        I could feel my strength, my will, my identity draining away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stumbled backward, switched my sword to my left hand, and lunged desperately.
                        My blade
                        should’ve run him through, but it deflected off his stomach like I was hitting solid marble.
                        There was no way he
                        should’ve survived that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos laughed. “A poor performance, Percy Jackson. Luke tells me you were
                        never his match at
                        swordplay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My vision started to blur. I knew I didn’t have much time. “Luke had a big
                        head,” I said. “But
                        at least it was <i class="calibre5">his </i>head.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“A shame to kill you now,” Kronos mused, “before the final plan unfolds. I
                        would love to see
                        the terror in your eyes when you realize how I will destroy Olympus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You’ll never get this boat to Manhattan.” My arm was throbbing. Black spots
                        danced in my eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“And why would that be?” Kronos’s golden eyes glittered. His face—Luke’s
                        face—seemed like a
                        mask, unnatural and lit from behind by some evil power. “Perhaps you are counting on your friend
                        with the
                        explosives?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He looked down at the pool and called, “Nakamura!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A teenage guy in full Greek armor pushed through the crowd. His left eye was
                        covered with a
                        black patch. I knew him, of course: Ethan Nakamura, the son of Nemesis. I’d saved his life in
                        the Labyrinth last
                        summer, and in return, the little punk had helped Kronos come back to life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Success, my lord,” Ethan called. “We found him just as we were told.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He clapped his hands, and two giants lumbered forward, dragging Charles
                        Beckendorf between
                        them. My heart almost stopped. Beckendorf had a swollen eye and cuts all over his face and arms.
                        His armor was
                        gone and his shirt was nearly torn off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf met my eyes. He glanced at his hand like he was trying to tell me
                        something. <i class="calibre5">His watch. </i>They hadn’t taken it yet, and that was the
                        detonator. Was it possible the
                        explosives were armed? Surely the monsters would’ve dismantled them right away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We found him amidships,” one of the giants said, “trying to sneak to the
                        engine room. Can we
                        eat him now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Soon.” Kronos scowled at Ethan. “Are you sure he didn’t set the explosives?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“He was going <i class="calibre5">toward </i>the engine room, my lord.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“How do you know that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Er…” Ethan shifted uncomfortably. “He was heading in that direction. And he
                        told us. His bag
                        is still full of explosives.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Slowly, I began to understand. Beckendorf had fooled them. When he’d realized
                        he was going to
                        be captured, he turned to make it look like he was going the other way. He’d convinced them he
                        hadn’t made it to
                        the engine room yet. The Greek fire might still be primed! But that didn’t do us any good unless
                        we could get
                        off the ship and detonate it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos hesitated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Buy the story</i>, I prayed. The pain in my arm was so bad
                        now I could
                        barely stand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Open his bag,” Kronos ordered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">One of the giants ripped the explosives satchel from Beckendorf’s shoulders. He
                        peered inside,
                        grunted, and turned it upside down. Panicked monsters surged backward. If the bag really had
                        been full of Greek
                        fire jars, we would’ve all blown up. But what fell out were a dozen cans of peaches. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I could hear Kronos breathing, trying to control his anger. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Did you, perhaps,” he said, “capture this demigod near the galley?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Ethan turned pale. “Um—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“And did you, perhaps, send someone to actually CHECK THE ENGINE ROOM?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Ethan scrambled back in terror, then turned on his heels and ran. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/1-10.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">I cursed silently. Now we had only minutes before the bombs were disarmed. I
                        caught
                        Beckendorf’s eyes again and asked a silent question, hoping he would understand: <i
                            class="calibre5">How long?
                        </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He cupped his fingers and thumb, making a circle. <i class="calibre5">ZERO.
                        </i>There was no
                        delay on the timer at all. If he managed to press the detonator button, the ship would blow at
                        once. We’d never
                        be able to get far enough away before using it. The monsters would kill us first, or disarm the
                        explosives, or
                        both. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos turned toward me with a crooked smile. “You’ll have to excuse my
                        incompetent help, Percy
                        Jackson, but it doesn’t matter. We have you now. We’ve known you were coming for weeks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He held out his hand and dangled a little silver bracelet with a scythe
                        charm—the Titan lord’s
                        symbol. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The wound in my arm was sapping my ability to think, but I muttered,
                        “Communication device…spy
                        at camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Kronos chuckled. “You can’t count on friends. They will always let you down.
                        Luke learned that
                        lesson the hard way. Now drop your sword and surrender to me, or your friend dies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I swallowed. One of the giants had his hand around Beckendorf’s neck. I was in
                        no shape to
                        rescue him, and even if I tried, he would die before I got there. We both would. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf mouthed one word: <i class="calibre5">Go. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shook my head. I couldn’t just leave him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The second giant was still rummaging through the peach cans, which meant
                        Beckendorf’s left arm
                        was free. He raised it slowly—toward the watch on his right wrist. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wanted to scream, <i class="calibre5">NO! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then down by the swimming pool, one of the <i class="calibre5">dracaenae
                        </i>hissed, “What isss
                        he doing? What isss that on hisss wrissst?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf closed eyes tight and brought his hand up to his watch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I had no choice. I threw my sword like a javelin at Kronos. It bounced
                        harmlessly off his
                        chest, but it did startle him. I pushed through a crowd of monsters and jumped off the side of
                        the ship—toward
                        the water a hundred feet below. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I heard rumbling deep in the ship. Monsters yelled at me from above. A spear
                        sailed past my
                        ear. An arrow pierced my thigh, but I barely had time to register the pain. I plunged into the
                        sea and willed
                        the currents to take me far, far away—a hundred yards, two hundred yards. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Even from that distance, the explosion shook the world. Heat seared the back of
                        my head. The <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda </i>blew up from both sides, a massive
                        fireball of green flame roiling
                        into the dark sky, consuming everything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf, I thought. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then I blacked out and sank like an anchor toward the bottom of the sea. </p>

                    <p class="calibre15">The thing is, they’re never just <i class="calibre5">dreams</i>. They’ve got to
                        be visions,
                        omens, and all that other mystical stuff that makes my brain hurt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I dreamed I was in a dark palace at the top of a mountain. Unfortunately, I
                        recognized it: the
                        palace of the Titans on top of Mount Othrys, otherwise known as Mount Tamalpais, in California.
                        The main
                        pavilion was open to the night, ringed with black Greek columns and statues of the Titans.
                        Torchlight glowed
                        against the black marble floor. In the center of the room, an armored giant struggled under the
                        weight of a
                        swirling funnel cloud—Atlas, holding up the weight of the sky. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Two other giant men stood nearby over a bronze brazier, studying images in the
                        flames. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Quite an explosion,” one said. He wore black armor studded with silver dots
                        like a starry
                        night. His face was covered in a war helm with ram’s horns curling on either side. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It doesn’t matter,” the other said. This Titan was dressed in gold robes, with
                        golden eyes
                        like Kronos. His entire body glowed. He reminded me of Apollo, God of the Sun, except the
                        Titan’s light was
                        harsher, and his expression crueler. “The gods have answered the challenge. Soon they will be
                        destroyed.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">The images in the fire were hard to make out: storms, buildings crumbling,
                        mortals screaming in
                        terror. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I will go east to marshal our forces,” the golden Titan said. “Krios, you
                        shall remain and
                        guard Mount Othrys.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The ram horn dude grunted. “I always get the stupid jobs. Lord of the South.
                        Lord of
                        Constellations. Now I get to babysit Atlas while <i class="calibre5">you </i>have all the fun.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Under the whirlwind of clouds, Atlas bellowed in agony. “Let me out, curse you!
                        I am your
                        greatest warrior. Take my burden so I may fight!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Quiet!” the golden Titan roared. “You had your chance, Atlas. You failed.
                        Kronos likes you
                        just where you are. As for you, Krios, do your duty.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“And if you need more warriors?” Krios asked. “Our treacherous nephew in the
                        tuxedo will not do
                        you much good in a fight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The golden Titan laughed. “Don’t worry about him. Besides, the gods can barely
                        handle our first
                        little challenge. They have no idea how many others we have in store. Mark my words, in a few
                        days’ time,
                        Olympus will be in ruins, and we will meet here again to celebrate the dawn of the Sixth Age!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The golden Titan erupted into the flames and disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, sure,” Krios grumbled. “He gets to erupt into flames. I get to wear these
                        stupid ram’s
                        horns.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The scene shifted. Now I was outside the pavilion, hiding in the shadows of a
                        Greek column. A
                        boy stood next to me, eavesdropping on the Titans. He had dark silky hair, pale skin, and dark
                        clothes—my friend
                        Nico di Angelo, the son of Hades. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He looked straight at me, his expression grim. “You see, Percy?” he whispered.
                        “You’re running
                        out of time. Do you really think you can beat them without my plan?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His words washed over me as cold as the ocean floor, and my dreams went black.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy?” a deep voice said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My head felt like it had been microwaved in aluminum foil. I opened my eyes and
                        saw a large
                        shadowy figure looming over me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Beckendorf?” I asked hopefully. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No, brother.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My eyes refocused. I was looking at a Cyclops—a misshapen face, ratty brown
                        hair, one big brown
                        eye full of concern. “Tyson?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My brother broke into a toothy grin. “Yay! Your brain works!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/2-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">I wasn’t so sure. My body felt weightless and cold. My voice sounded wrong. I
                        could hear Tyson,
                        but it was more like I was hearing vibrations inside my skull, not the regular sounds. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I sat up, and a gossamer sheet floated away. I was on a bed made of silky woven
                        kelp, in a room
                        paneled with abalone shell. Glowing pearls the size of basketballs floated around the ceiling,
                        providing light.
                        I was under water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Now, being the son of Poseidon and all, I was okay with this. I can breathe
                        underwater just
                        fine, and my clothes don’t even get wet unless I want them to. But it was still a bit of a shock
                        when a
                        hammerhead shark drifted through the bedroom window, regarded me, and then swam calmly out the
                        opposite side of
                        the room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Where—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Daddy’s palace,” Tyson said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Under different circumstances, I would’ve been excited. I’d never visited
                        Poseidon’s realm, and
                        I’d been dreaming about it for years. But my head hurt. My shirt was still speckled with burn
                        marks from the
                        explosion. My arm and leg wounds had healed—just being in the ocean can do that for me, given
                        enough time—but I
                        still felt like I’d been trampled by a Laistrygonian soccer team in cleats. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“How long—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We found you last night,” Tyson said, “sinking through the water.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Went ka-boom,” Tyson confirmed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Beckendorf was on board. Did you find…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Tyson’s face darkened. “No sign of him. I am sorry, brother.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stared out the window into deep blue water. Beckendorf was supposed to go to
                        college in the
                        fall. He had a girlfriend, lots of friends, his whole life ahead of him. He couldn’t be <i
                            class="calibre5">gone</i>. Maybe he’d made it off the ship like I had. Maybe he’d jumped
                        over the side…and
                        what? He couldn’t have survived a hundred-foot fall into the water like I could. He couldn’t
                        have put enough
                        distance between himself and the explosion. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I knew in my gut he was dead. He’d sacrificed himself to take out the <i
                            class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>, and I had abandoned him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I thought about my dream: the Titans discussing the explosion as if it didn’t
                        matter, Nico di
                        Angelo warning me that I would never beat Kronos without following his plan—a dangerous idea I’d
                        been avoiding
                        for more than a year. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A distant blast shook the room. Green light blazed outside, turning the whole
                        sea as bright as
                        noon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What was that?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Tyson looked worried. “Daddy will explain. Come, he is blowing up monsters.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">The palace might have been the most amazing place I’d ever seen if it hadn’t
                        been in the
                        process of getting destroyed. We swam to the end of a long hallway and shot upward on a geyser.
                        As we rose over
                        the rooftops I caught my breath— well, if you can catch your breath underwater. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The palace was as big as the city on Mount Olympus, with wide courtyards,
                        gardens, and columned
                        pavilions. The gardens were sculpted with coral colonies and glowing sea plants. Twenty or
                        thirty buildings were
                        made of abalone, white but gleaming with rainbow colors. Fish and octopi darted in and out of
                        the windows. The
                        paths were lined with glowing pearls like Christmas lights. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/2-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">The main courtyard was filled with warriors—mermen with fish tails from the
                        waist down and
                        human bodies from the waist up, except their skin was blue, which I’d never known before. Some
                        were tending the
                        wounded. Some were sharpening spears and swords. One passed us, swimming in a hurry. His eyes
                        were bright green,
                        like that stuff they put in glo-sticks, and his teeth were shark teeth. They don’t show you
                        stuff like that in
                        <i class="calibre5">The Little Mermaid</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Outside the main courtyard stood large fortifications— towers, walls, and
                        antisiege weapons—but
                        most of these had been smashed to ruins. Others were blazing with a strange green light that I
                        knew well—Greek
                        fire, which can burn even underwater. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beyond this, the sea floor stretched into gloom. I could see battles
                        raging—flashes of energy,
                        explosions, the glint of armies clashing. A regular human would’ve found it too dark to see.
                        Heck, a regular
                        human would’ve been crushed by the pressure and frozen by the cold. Even my heat-sensitive eyes
                        couldn’t make
                        out exactly what was going on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">At the edge of the palace complex, a temple with a red coral roof exploded,
                        sending fire and
                        debris streaming in slow motion across the farthest gardens. Out of the darkness above, an
                        enormous form
                        appeared—a squid larger than any skyscraper. It was surrounded by a glittering cloud of dust—at
                        least I thought
                        it was dust until I realized it was a swarm of mermen trying to attack the monster. The squid
                        descended on the
                        palace, swatted its tentacles, smashing whole columns of warriors. Then a brilliant arc of blue
                        light shot from
                        the rooftop of one of the tallest buildings. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/2-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">The light hit the giant squid, and the monster dissolved like food coloring in
                        water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Daddy,” Tyson said, pointing to where the light had come from. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“<i class="calibre5">He </i>did that?” I suddenly felt more hopeful. My dad had
                        unbelievable
                        powers. He was the god of the sea. He could deal with this attack, right? Maybe he’d let me
                        help. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Have you been in the fight?” I asked Tyson in awe. “Like bashing heads with
                        your awesome
                        Cyclops strength and stuff?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Tyson pouted, and immediately I knew I’d asked a bad question. “I have
                        been…fixing weapons,” he
                        mumbled. “Come. Let’s go find Daddy.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">I know this might sound weird to people with, like, regular parents, but I’d
                        only seen my dad
                        four or five times in my life, and never for more than a few minutes. The Greek gods don’t
                        exactly show up for
                        their kids’ basketball games. Still, I thought I would recognize Poseidon on sight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The roof of the temple was a big open deck that had been set up as a command
                        center. A mosaic
                        on the floor showed an exact map of the palace grounds and the surrounding ocean, but the mosaic
                        moved. Colored
                        stone tiles representing different armies and sea monsters shifted around as the forces changed
                        position.
                        Buildings that collapsed in real life also collapsed in the picture. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Standing around the mosaic, grimly studying the battle, was a strange
                        assortment of warriors,
                        but none of them looked like my dad. I was searching for a big guy with a good tan and a black
                        beard, wearing
                        Bermuda shorts and a Hawaiian shirt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There was nobody like that. One guy was a merman with two fishtails instead of
                        one. His skin
                        was green, his armor studded with pearls. His black hair was tied in a ponytail, and he looked
                        young—though it’s
                        hard to tell with non-humans. They could be a thousand years old or three. Standing next to him
                        was an old man
                        with a flowing white beard and gray hair. His battle armor seemed to weigh him down. He had
                        green eyes and smile
                        wrinkles around his eyes, but he wasn’t smiling now. He was studying the map and leaning on a
                        large metal staff.
                        To his right stood a beautiful woman in green armor with long black hair and strange little
                        horns like crab
                        claws. And there was a dolphin—just a regular dolphin, but it was staring at the map intently.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Delphin,” the old man said. “Send Palaemon and his legion of sharks to the
                        western front. We
                        have to neutralize those leviathans.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The dolphin spoke in a chattering voice, but I could understand it in my mind:
                        <i class="calibre5">Yes, lord! </i>It sped away.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I looked in dismay at Tyson, then back at the old man. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It didn’t seem possible, but…“Dad?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The old man looked up. I recognized the twinkle in his eyes, but his face…he
                        looked like he’d
                        aged forty years. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Hello, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What—what happened to you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Tyson nudged me. He was shaking his head so hard I was afraid it would fall
                        off, but Poseidon
                        didn’t look offended. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It’s all right, Tyson,” he said. “Percy, excuse my appearance. The war has
                        been hard on me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“But you’re immortal,” I said quietly. “You can look…any way you want.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I reflect the state of my realm,” he said. “And right now that state is quite
                        grim. Percy, I
                        should introduce you—I’m afraid you just missed my lieutenant Delphin, God of the Dolphins. This
                        is my, er,
                        wife, Amphitrite. My dear—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The lady in green armor stared at me coldly, then crossed her arms and said,
                        “Excuse me, my
                        lord. I am needed in the battle.” </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">She swam away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I felt pretty awkward, but I guess I couldn’t blame her. I’d never thought
                        about it much, but
                        my dad had an immortal wife. All his romances with mortals, including with my mom…well,
                        Amphitrite probably
                        didn’t like that much. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Poseidon cleared his throat. “Yes, well…and this is my son Triton. Er, my <i
                            class="calibre5">other </i>son.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Your son and heir,” the green dude corrected. His double fishtails swished
                        back and forth. He
                        smiled at me, but there was no friendliness in his eyes. “Hello, Perseus Jackson. Come to help
                        at last?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/2-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">He acted like I was late or lazy. If you can blush underwater, I probably did.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Tell me what to do,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Triton smiled like that was a cute suggestion—like I was a slightly amusing dog
                        that had barked
                        for him or something. He turned to Poseidon. “I will see to the front line, Father. Don’t worry.
                        <i class="calibre5">I </i>will not fail.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He nodded politely to Tyson. How come I didn’t get that much respect? Then he
                        shot off into the
                        water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Poseidon sighed. He raised his staff, and it changed into his regular weapon—a
                        huge
                        three-pointed trident. The tips glowed with blue light, and the water around it boiled with
                        energy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’m sorry about that,” he told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A huge sea serpent appeared from above us and spiraled down toward the roof. It
                        was bright
                        orange with a fanged mouth big enough to swallow a gymnasium. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hardly looking up, Poseidon pointed his trident at the beast and zapped it with
                        blue energy. <i class="calibre5">Ka-boom! </i>The monster burst into a million goldfish, which
                        all swam off in terror. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“My family is anxious,” Poseidon continued as if nothing had happened. “The
                        battle against
                        Oceanus is going poorly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He pointed to the edge of the mosaic. With the butt of his trident he tapped
                        the image of a
                        merman larger than the rest, with the horns of a bull. He appeared to be riding a chariot pulled
                        by crawfish,
                        and instead of a sword he wielded a live serpent. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/2-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oceanus,” I said, trying to remember. “The Titan of the sea?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Poseidon nodded. “He was neutral in the first war of gods and Titans. But
                        Kronos has convinced
                        him to fight. This is…well, it’s not a good sign. Oceanus would not commit unless he was sure he
                        could pick the
                        winning side.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“He looks stupid,” I said, trying to sound upbeat. “I mean, who fights with a
                        snake?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Daddy will tie it in knots,” Tyson said firmly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Poseidon smiled, but he looked weary. “I appreciate your faith. We have been at
                        war almost a
                        year now. My powers are taxed. And still he finds new forces to throw at me— sea monsters so
                        ancient I had
                        forgotten about them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I heard an explosion in the distance. About half a mile away, a mountain of
                        coral disintegrated
                        under the weight of two giant creatures. I could dimly make out their shapes. One was a lobster.
                        The other was a
                        giant humanoid like a Cyclops, but he was surrounded by a flurry of limbs. At first I thought he
                        wearing a bunch
                        of giant octopi. Then I realized they were his own arms—a hundred flailing, fighting arms. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/2-9.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Briares!” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was happy to see him, but he looked like he was fighting for his life. He was
                        the last of his
                        kind—a Hundred-Handed One, cousin of the Cyclopes. We’d saved him from Kronos’s prison last
                        summer, and I knew
                        he’d come to help Poseidon, but I hadn’t heard of him since. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“He fights well,” Poseidon said. “I wish we had a whole army like him, but he
                        is the only one.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I watched as Briares bellowed in rage and picked up the lobster, which thrashed
                        and snapped its
                        pincers. He threw it off the coral mountain, and the lobster disappeared into the darkness.
                        Briares swam after
                        it, his hundred arms spinning like the blades of a motorboat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy, we may not have much time,” my dad said. “Tell me of your mission. Did
                        you see Kronos?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I told him everything, though my voice choked up when I explained about
                        Beckendorf. I looked
                        down at the courtyards below and saw hundreds of wounded mermen lying on makeshift cots. I saw
                        rows of coral
                        mounds that must’ve been hastily made graves. I realized Beckendorf wasn’t the first death. He
                        was only one of
                        hundreds, maybe thousands. I’d never felt so angry and helpless. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Poseidon stroked his beard. “Percy, Beckendorf chose a heroic death. You bear
                        no blame for
                        that. Kronos’s army will be in disarray. Many were destroyed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“But we didn’t kill him, did we?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">As I said it, I knew it was a naive hope. We might blow up his ship and
                        disintegrate his
                        monsters, but a Titan lord wouldn’t be so easy to kill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No,” Poseidon admitted. “But you’ve bought our side some time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“There were demigods on that ship,” I said, thinking of the kid I’d seen in the
                        stairwell.
                        Somehow I’d allowed myself to concentrate on the monsters and Kronos. I’d convinced myself that
                        destroying their
                        ship was all right because they were evil, they were sailing to attack my city, and besides they
                        couldn’t really
                        be permanently killed. Monsters just vaporized and re-formed eventually. But demigods…</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Poseidon put his hand on my shoulder. “Percy, there were only a few demigod
                        warriors aboard
                        that ship, and they all chose to battle for Kronos. Perhaps some heeded your warning and
                        escaped. If they did
                        not…they chose their path.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“They were brainwashed!” I said. “Now they’re dead and Kronos is still alive.
                        That’s supposed
                        to make me feel better?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glared at the mosaic—little tile explosions destroying tile monsters. It
                        seemed so easy when
                        it was just a picture. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Tyson put his arm around me. If anybody else had tried that, I would’ve pushed
                        him away, but
                        Tyson was too big and stubborn. He hugged me whether I wanted it or not. “Not your fault,
                        brother. Kronos does
                        not explode good. Next time we will use a big stick.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy,” my father said. “Beckendorf’s sacrifice wasn’t in vain. You have
                        scattered the
                        invasion force. New York will be safe for a time, which frees the other Olympians to deal with
                        the bigger
                        threat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The bigger threat?” I thought about what the golden Titan had said in my
                        dream: <i class="calibre5">The gods have answered the challenge. Soon they will be destroyed.
                        </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A shadow passed over my father’s face. “You’ve had enough sorrow for one day.
                        Ask Chiron when
                        you return to camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Return to camp? But you’re in trouble here. I want to help!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You can’t, Percy. Your job is elsewhere.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I couldn’t believe I was hearing this. I looked at Tyson for backup. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My brother chewed his lip. “Daddy…Percy can fight with a sword. He is good.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I know that,” Poseidon said gently. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Dad, I can help,” I said. “I know I can. You’re not going to hold out here
                        much longer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A fireball launched into the sky from behind the enemy lines. I thought
                        Poseidon would deflect
                        it or something, but it landed on the outer corner of the yard and exploded, sending mermen
                        tumbling through the
                        water. Poseidon winced as if he’d just been stabbed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Return to camp,” he insisted. “And tell Chiron it is time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“For what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You must hear the prophecy. The <i class="calibre5">entire </i>prophecy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t need to ask him which prophecy. I’d been hearing about the “Great
                        Prophecy” for years,
                        but nobody would ever tell me the whole thing. All I knew was that I was supposed to make a
                        decision that would
                        decide the fate of the world—but no pressure. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What if <i class="calibre5">this </i>is the decision?” I said. “Staying here
                        to fight, or
                        leaving? What if I leave and you…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I couldn’t say <i class="calibre5">die</i>. Gods weren’t supposed to die, but
                        I’d seen it
                        happen. Even if they didn’t die, they could be reduced to nearly nothing, exiled, imprisoned in
                        the depths of
                        Tartarus like Kronos had been. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy, you must go,” Poseidon insisted. “I don’t know what your final decision
                        will be, but
                        your fight lies in the world above. If nothing else, you must warn your friends at camp. Kronos
                        knew your plans.
                        You have a spy. We will hold here. We have no choice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Tyson gripped my hand desperately. “I will miss you, brother!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Watching us, our father seemed to age another ten years. “Tyson, you have work
                        to do as well,
                        my son. They need you in the armory.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Tyson pouted some more. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I will go,” he sniffled. He hugged me so hard he almost cracked my ribs.
                        “Percy, be careful!
                        Do not let monsters kill you dead!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I tried to nod confidently, but it was too much for the big guy. He sobbed and
                        swam away toward
                        the armory, where his cousins were fixing spears and swords. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You should let him fight,” I told my father. “He hates being stuck in the
                        armory. Can’t you
                        tell?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Poseidon shook his head. “It is bad enough I must send you into danger. Tyson
                        is too young. I
                        must protect him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You should trust him,” I said. “Not try to protect him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Poseidon’s eyes flared. I thought I’d gone too far, but then he looked down at
                        the mosaic and
                        his shoulders sagged. On the tiles, the mermaid guy in the crawfish chariot was coming closer to
                        the palace.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oceanus approaches,” my father said. “I must meet him in battle.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I’d never been scared for a god before, but I didn’t see how my dad could face
                        this Titan and
                        win. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I will hold,” Poseidon promised. “I will not give up my domain. Just tell me,
                        Percy, do you
                        still have the birthday gift I gave you last summer?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nodded and pulled out my camp necklace. It had a bead for every summer I’d
                        been at Camp
                        Half-Blood, but since last year I’d also kept a sand dollar on the cord. My father had given it
                        to me for my
                        fifteenth birthday. He’d told me I would know when to “spend it,” but so far I hadn’t figured
                        out what he meant.
                        All I knew was that it didn’t fit the vending machines in the school cafeteria. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/2-10.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“The time is coming,” he promised. “With luck, I will see you for your birthday
                        next week, and
                        we will have a proper celebration.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He smiled, and for a moment I saw the old light in his eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then the entire sea grew dark in front of us, like an inky storm was rolling
                        in. Thunder
                        crackled, which should’ve been impossible underwater. A huge icy presence was approaching. I
                        sensed a wave of
                        fear roll through the armies below us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I must assume my true godly form,” Poseidon said. “Go—and good luck, my son.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wanted to encourage him, to hug him or something, but knew better than to
                        stick around. When
                        a god assumes his true form, the power is so great that any mortal looking on him will
                        disintegrate. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Good-bye, Father,” I managed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then I turned away. I willed the ocean currents to aid me. Water swirled around
                        me, and I shot
                        toward the surface at speeds that would’ve caused any normal human to pop like a balloon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I looked back, all I could see were flashes of green and blue as my father
                        fought the
                        Titan, and the sea itself was torn apart by the two armies. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">If you want to be popular at Camp Half-Blood, don’t come back from a mission
                        with bad news.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Word of my arrival spread as soon as I walked out of the ocean. Our beach is on
                        the North Shore
                        of Long Island, and it’s enchanted so most people can’t even see it. People don’t just <i
                            class="calibre5">appear </i>on the beach unless they’re demigods or gods or really, really
                        lost pizza
                        delivery guys. (It’s happened—but that’s another story.) </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Anyway, that afternoon the lookout on duty was Connor Stoll from the Hermes
                        cabin. When he
                        spotted me, he got so excited he fell out of his tree. Then he blew the conch horn to signal the
                        camp and ran to
                        greet me. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/3-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Connor had a crooked smile that matched his crooked sense of humor. He’s a
                        pretty nice guy, but
                        you should always keep one hand on your wallet when he’s around, and do not, under any
                        circumstances, give him
                        access to shaving cream unless you want to find your sleeping bag full of it. He’s got curly
                        brown hair and is a
                        little shorter than his brother, Travis, which is the only way I can tell them apart. They are
                        both so unlike my
                        old enemy Luke it’s hard to believe they’re all sons of Hermes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy!” he yelled. “What happened? Where’s Beckendorf?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then he saw my expression, and his smile melted. “Oh, no. Poor Silena. Holy
                        Zeus, when she
                        finds out…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Together we climbed the sand dunes. A few hundred yards away, people were
                        already streaming
                        toward us, smiling and excited. <i class="calibre5">Percy’s back</i>, they were probably
                        thinking. <i class="calibre5">He’s saved the day! Maybe he brought souvenirs! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stopped at the dining pavilion and waited for them. No sense rushing down
                        there to tell them
                        what a loser I was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I gazed across the valley and tried to remember how Camp Half-Blood looked the
                        first time I
                        ever saw it. That seemed like a bajillion years ago. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">From the dining pavilion, you could see pretty much everything. Hills ringed
                        the valley. On the
                        tallest, Half-Blood Hill, Thalia’s pine tree stood with the Golden Fleece hanging from its
                        branches, magically
                        protecting the camp from its enemies. The guard dragon Peleus was so big now I could see him
                        from here—curled
                        around the tree trunk, sending up smoke signals as he snored. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/3-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">To my right spread the woods. To my left, the canoe lake glittered and the
                        climbing wall glowed
                        from the lava pouring down its side. Twelve cabins—one for each Olympian god—made a horseshoe
                        pattern around the
                        commons area. Farther south were the strawberry fields, the armory, and the four-story Big House
                        with its sky
                        blue paint job and its bronze eagle weathervane. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">In some ways, the camp hadn’t changed. But you couldn’t see the war by looking
                        at the buildings
                        or the fields. You could see it in the faces of the demigods and satyrs and naiads coming up the
                        hill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">There weren’t as many at camp as four summers ago. Some had left and never come
                        back. Some had
                        died fighting. Others—we tried not to talk about them—had gone over to the enemy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The ones who were still here were battle-hardened and weary. There was little
                        laughter at camp
                        these days. Even the Hermes cabin didn’t play so many pranks. It’s hard to enjoy practical jokes
                        when your whole
                        life feels like one. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron galloped into the pavilion first, which was easy for him since he’s a
                        white stallion
                        from the waist down. His beard had grown wilder over the summer. He wore a green T-shirt that
                        said <small>MY OTHER CAR
                            IS A CENTAUR</small> and a bow slung over his back. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/3-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy!” he said. “Thank the gods. But where…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth ran in right behind him, and I’ll admit my heart did a little relay
                        race in my chest
                        when I saw her. It’s not that she tried to look good. We’d been doing so many combat missions
                        lately, she hardly
                        brushed her curly blond hair anymore, and she didn’t care what clothes she was wearing—usually
                        the same old
                        orange camp T-shirt and jeans, and once in a while her bronze armor. Her eyes were stormy gray.
                        Most of the time
                        we couldn’t get through a conversation without trying to strangle each other. Still, just seeing
                        her made me
                        feel fuzzy in the head. Last summer, before Luke had turned into Kronos and everything went
                        sour, there had been
                        a few times when I thought maybe…well, we might get past the strangle-each-other phase. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What happened?” She grabbed my arm. “Is Luke—” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/3-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“The ship blew up,” I said. “He wasn’t destroyed. I don’t know where—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Silena Beauregard pushed through the crowd. Her hair wasn’t combed and she
                        wasn’t even wearing
                        makeup, which wasn’t like her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Where’s Charlie?” she demanded, looking around like he might be hiding. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glanced at Chiron helplessly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The old centaur cleared his throat. “Silena, my dear, let’s talk about this at
                        the Big House—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No,” she muttered. “No. <i class="calibre5">No</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She started to cry, and the rest of us stood around, too stunned to speak. We’d
                        already lost so
                        many people over the summer, but this was the worst. With Beckendorf gone, it felt like someone
                        had stolen the
                        anchor for the entire camp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Finally Clarisse from the Ares cabin came forward. She put her arm around
                        Silena. They had one
                        of the strangest friendships ever—a daughter of the war god and a daughter of the love
                        goddess—but ever since
                        Silena had given Clarisse advice last summer about her first boyfriend, Clarisse had decided she
                        was Silena’s
                        personal bodyguard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Clarisse was dressed in her bloodred combat armor, her brown hair tucked into a
                        bandana. She
                        was as big and beefy as a rugby player, with a permanent scowl on her face, but she spoke gently
                        to Silena. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Come on, girl,” she said. “Let’s get to the Big House. I’ll make you some hot
                        chocolate.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/3-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Everyone turned and wandered off in twos and threes, heading back to the
                        cabins. Nobody was
                        excited to see me now. Nobody wanted to hear about the blown-up ship. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Only Annabeth and Chiron stayed behind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth wiped a tear from her cheek. “I’m glad you’re not dead, Seaweed
                        Brain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Thanks,” I said. “Me too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron put a hand on my shoulder. “I’m sure you did everything you could,
                        Percy. Will you tell
                        us what happened?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t want to go through it again, but I told them the story, including the
                        dream of the
                        Titans. I left out the detail about Nico. Nico had made me promise not to tell anybody about his
                        plan until I
                        made up my mind, and the plan was so scary I didn’t mind keeping it a secret. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron gazed down at the valley. “We must call a war council immediately, to
                        discuss this spy,
                        and other matters.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Poseidon mentioned another threat,” I said. “Something even bigger than the <i
                            class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>. I thought it might be that challenge the Titan had
                        mentioned in my
                        dream.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron and Annabeth exchanged looks, like they knew something I didn’t. I hated
                        when they did
                        that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We will discuss that also,” Chiron promised. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“One more thing.” I took a deep breath. “When I talked to my father, he said to
                        tell you it’s
                        time. I need to know the full prophecy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron’s shoulders sagged, but he didn’t look surprised. “I’ve dreaded this
                        day. Very well.
                        Annabeth, we will show Percy the truth—all of it. Let’s go to the attic.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I’d been to the Big House attic three times before, which was three times more
                        than I wanted
                        to. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A ladder led up from the top of the staircase. I wondered how Chiron was going
                        to get up there,
                        being half horse and all, but he didn’t try. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You know where it is,” he told Annabeth. “Bring it down, please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth nodded. “Come on, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The sun was setting outside, so the attic was even darker and creepier than
                        usual. Old hero
                        trophies were stacked everywhere—dented shields, pickled heads in jars from various monsters, a
                        pair of fuzzy
                        dice on a bronze plaque that read: <small>STOLEN FROM CHRYSAOR’S HONDA CIVIC, BY GUS, SON OF
                            HERMES,
                            1988</small>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I picked up a curved bronze sword so badly bent it looked like the letter <i
                            class="calibre5">M</i>. I could still see green stains on the metal from the magical poison
                        that used to
                        cover it. The tag was dated last summer. It read: <i class="calibre5">Scimitar of Kampê,
                            destroyed in the Battle
                            of the Labyrinth</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You remember Briares throwing those boulders?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth gave me a grudging smile. “And Grover causing a Panic?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We locked eyes. I thought of a different time last summer, under Mount St.
                        Helens, when
                        Annabeth thought I was going to die, and she kissed me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She cleared her throat and looked away. “Prophecy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Right.” I put down the scimitar. “Prophecy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We walked over to the window. On a three-legged stool sat the Oracle—a
                        shriveled female mummy
                        in a tie-dyed dress. Tufts of black hair clung to her skull. Glassy eyes stared out of her
                        leathery face. Just
                        looking at her made my skin crawl. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/3-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">If you wanted to leave camp during the summer, it used to be you had to come up
                        here to get a
                        quest. This summer, that rule had been tossed. Campers left all the time on combat missions. We
                        had no choice if
                        we wanted to stop Kronos. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Still, I remembered too well the strange green mist—the spirit of the
                        Oracle—that lived inside
                        the mummy. She looked lifeless now, but whenever she spoke a prophecy, she moved. Sometimes fog
                        gushed out of
                        her mouth and created strange shapes. Once, she’d even left the attic and taken a little zombie
                        stroll into the
                        woods to deliver a message. I wasn’t sure what she’d do for the “Great Prophecy.” I half
                        expected her to start
                        tap dancing or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But she just sat there like she was dead—which she was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I never understood this,” I whispered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Why it’s a mummy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy, she didn’t used to be a mummy. For thousands of years the spirit of the
                        Oracle lived
                        inside a beautiful maiden. The spirit would be passed on from generation to generation. Chiron
                        told me <i class="calibre5">she </i>was like that fifty years ago.” Annabeth pointed at the
                        mummy. “But she was the
                        last.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What happened?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth stared to say something, then apparently changed her mind. “Let’s just
                        do our job and
                        get out of here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I looked nervously at the Oracle’s withered face. “So what now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth approached the mummy and held out her palms. “O Oracle, the time is at
                        hand. I ask for
                        the Great Prophecy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I braced myself, but the mummy didn’t move. Instead, Annabeth approached and
                        unclasped one of
                        its necklaces. I’d never paid too much attention to its jewelry before. I figured it was just
                        hippie love beads
                        and stuff. But when Annabeth turned toward me, she was holding a leather pouch—like a Native
                        American medicine
                        pouch on a cord braided with feathers. She opened the bag and took out a roll of parchment no
                        bigger than her
                        pinky. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/3-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“No way,” I said. “You mean all these years, I’ve been asking about this stupid
                        prophecy, and
                        it’s been right there around her neck?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The time wasn’t right,” Annabeth said. “Believe me, Percy, I read this when I
                        was ten years
                        old, and I still have nightmares about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Great,” I said. “Can I read it now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Downstairs at the war council,” Annabeth said. “Not in front of…you know.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I looked at the glassy eyes of the Oracle, and I decided not to argue. We
                        headed downstairs to
                        join the others. I didn’t know it then, but it would be the last time I ever visited the attic.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The senior counselors had gathered around the Ping-Pong table. Don’t ask me
                        why, but the rec
                        room had become the camp’s informal headquarters for war councils. When Annabeth, Chiron, and I
                        came in, though,
                        it looked more like a shouting match. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Clarisse was still in full battle gear. Her electric spear was strapped to her
                        back. (Actually,
                        her <i class="calibre5">second </i>electric spear, since I’d broken the first one. She called
                        the spear
                        “Maimer.” Behind her back, everybody else called it “Lamer.”) She had her boar-shaped helmet
                        under one arm and a
                        knife at her belt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She was in the midst of yelling at Michael Yew, the new head counselor for
                        Apollo, which looked
                        kind of funny since Clarisse was a foot taller. Michael had taken over the Apollo cabin after
                        Lee Fletcher died
                        in battle last summer. Michael stood four-foot-six with another two feet of attitude. He
                        reminded me of a
                        ferret, with a pointy nose and scrunched-up features—either because he scowled so much or
                        because he spent too
                        much time looking down the shaft of an arrow. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/3-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“It’s <i class="calibre5">our </i>loot!” he yelled, standing on his tiptoes so
                        he could get in
                        Clarisse’s face. “If you don’t like it, you can kiss my quiver!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Around the table, people were trying not to laugh—the Stoll brothers, Pollux
                        from the Dionysus
                        cabin, Katie Gardner from Demeter. Even Jake Mason, the hastily appointed new counselor from
                        Hephaestus, managed
                        a faint smile. Only Silena Beauregard didn’t pay any attention. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She sat beside Clarisse and stared vacantly at the Ping-Pong net. Her eyes were
                        red and puffy.
                        A cup of hot chocolate sat untouched in front of her. It seemed unfair that she had to be here.
                        I couldn’t
                        believe Clarisse and Michael standing over her, arguing about something as stupid as loot, when
                        she’d just lost
                        Beckendorf. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“STOP IT!” I yelled. “What are you guys doing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Clarisse glowered at me. “Tell
                        Michael not to
                        be a selfish jerk.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, that’s perfect, coming from you,” Michael said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The only reason I’m here
                        is to support
                        Silena!” Clarisse shouted. “Otherwise I’d be back in my cabin.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What are you talking about?” I demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Pollux cleared his throat. “Clarisse
                        has refused to
                        speak to any of us, until her, um, issue is resolved. She hasn’t spoken for three days.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It’s been wonderful,” Travis Stoll said wistfully. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What issue?” I asked.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Clarisse turned to
                        Chiron. “You’re in charge, right? Does my cabin get what we want or not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron shuffled his hooves. “My dear, as I’ve already explained, Michael is
                        correct. Apollo’s
                        cabin has the best claim. Besides, we have more important matters—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Sure,” Clarisse snapped. “Always more important matters than what Ares needs.
                        We’re just
                        supposed to show up and fight when you need us, and not complain!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“That would be nice,” Connor Stoll muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Clarisse gripped her knife. “Maybe
                        I should ask
                        Mr. D—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“As you know,” Chiron interrupted, his tone slightly angry now, “our director,
                        Dionysus, is
                        busy with the war. He can’t be bothered with this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I see,” Clarisse said. “And the senior counselors? Are <i class="calibre5">any
                        </i>of you
                        going to side with me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nobody was smiling now. None of them met Clarisse’s eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Fine.” Clarisse turned to Silena. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to get into this
                        when you’ve just
                        lost…Anyway, I apologize. To <i class="calibre5">you</i>. Nobody else.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Silena didn’t seem to register her words. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Clarisse threw her knife on the Ping-Pong table. “All of you can fight this war
                        without Ares.
                        Until I get satisfaction, no one in my cabin is lifting a finger to help. Have fun dying.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/3-9.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">The counselors were all too stunned to say anything as Clarisse stormed out of
                        the room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Finally Michael Yew said, “Good riddance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Are you kidding?” Katie Gardner protested. “This is a disaster!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“She can’t be serious,” Travis said. “Can she?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron sighed. “Her pride has been wounded. She’ll calm down eventually.” But
                        he didn’t sound
                        convinced. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wanted to ask what the heck Clarisse was so mad about, but I looked at
                        Annabeth and she
                        mouthed the words <i class="calibre5">I’ll tell you later</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Now,” Chiron continued, “if you please, counselors. Percy has brought
                        something I think you
                        should hear. Percy—the Great Prophecy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth handed me the parchment. It felt dry and old, and my fingers fumbled
                        with the string.
                        I uncurled the paper, trying not to rip it, and began to read: </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“A half-blood of the eldest dogs…” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Er, Percy?” Annabeth interrupted. “That’s <i class="calibre5">gods</i>. Not <i
                            class="calibre5">dogs</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, right,” I said. Being dyslexic is one mark of a demigod, but sometimes I
                        really hate it.
                        The more nervous I am, the worse my reading gets. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“A half-blood of the
                            eldest gods… </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Shall

                    <p class="calibre15">I hesitated, staring at the next lines. A cold feeling started in my fingers as
                        if the paper
                        was freezing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“And see the world in endless sleep, </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">The hero’s soul, cursed blade shall reap.” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Suddenly Riptide seemed heavier in my pocket. A cursed blade? Chiron once told
                        me Riptide had
                        brought many people sorrow. Was it possible my own sword could get me killed? And how could the
                        world to fall
                        into endless sleep, unless that meant death? </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy,” Chiron urged. “Read the rest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My mouth felt like it was full of sand, but I spoke the last two lines. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“A single choice shall…shall end his days. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Olympus to per—pursue—” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“Preserve,” </i>Annabeth said gently. “It means <i
                            class="calibre5">to
                            save</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I know what it means,” I grumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“Olympus to preserve or
                            raze.” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The room was silent. Finally Connor Stoll said, “Raise is good, isn’t it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Not <i class="calibre5">raise</i>,” Silena said. Her voice was hollow, but I
                        was startled to
                        hear her speak at all. “R-a-z-e means <i class="calibre5">destroy</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Obliterate,” Annabeth said. “Annihilate. Turn to rubble.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Got it.” My heart felt like lead. “Thanks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Everybody was looking at me—with concern, or pity, or maybe a little fear. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron closed his eyes as if he were saying a prayer. In horse form, his head
                        almost brushed
                        the lights in the rec room. “You see now, Percy, why we thought it best not to tell you the
                        whole prophecy.
                        You’ve had enough on your shoulders—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Without realizing I was going to die in the end anyway?” I said. “Yeah, I get
                        it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron gazed at me sadly. The guy was three thousand years old. He’d seen
                        hundreds of heroes
                        die. He might not like it, but he was used to it. He probably knew better than to try to
                        reassure me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy,” Annabeth said. “You know prophecies always have double meanings. It
                        might not
                        literally mean you die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Sure,” I said. <i class="calibre5">“A single choice shall end his days.
                        </i>That has tons of
                        meanings, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Maybe we can stop it,” Jake Mason offered. <i class="calibre5">“The hero’s
                            soul, cursed blade
                            shall reap. </i>Maybe we could find this cursed blade and destroy it. Sounds like Kronos’s
                        scythe, right?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hadn’t thought about that, but it didn’t matter if the cursed blade was
                        Riptide or Kronos’s
                        scythe. Either way, I doubted we could stop the prophecy. A blade was supposed to reap my soul.
                        As general rule,
                        I preferred not to have my soul reaped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Perhaps we should let Percy think about these lines,” Chiron said. “He needs
                        time—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No.” I folded up the prophecy and shoved it into my pocket. I felt defiant and
                        angry, though I
                        wasn’t sure who I was angry with. “I don’t need time. If I die, I die. I can’t worry about that,
                        right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth’s hands were shaking a little. She wouldn’t meet my eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Let’s move on,” I said. “We’ve got other problems. We’ve got a spy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Michael Yew scowled. “A spy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I told them what had happened on the <i class="calibre5">Princess
                            Andromeda</i>—how Kronos had
                        known we were coming, how he’d shown me the silver scythe pendant he’d used to communicate with
                        someone at camp.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Silena started to cry again, and Annabeth put an arm around her shoulders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Well,” Connor Stoll said uncomfortably, “we’ve suspected there might a spy for
                        years, right?
                        Somebody kept passing information to Luke—like the location of the Golden Fleece a couple of
                        years ago. It must
                        be somebody who knew him well.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Maybe subconsciously, he glanced at Annabeth. She’d known Luke better than
                        anyone, of course,
                        but Connor looked away quickly. “Um, I mean, it could be anybody.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Yes.” Katie Gardner frowned at the Stoll brothers. She’d disliked them ever
                        since they’d
                        decorated the grass roof of the Demeter cabin with chocolate Easter bunnies. “Like one of Luke’s
                        siblings.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Travis and Connor both started arguing with her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Stop!” Silena banged the table so hard her hot chocolate spilled. “Charlie’s
                        dead and…and
                        you’re all arguing like little kids!” She put her head down and began to sob. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Hot chocolate trickled off the Ping-Pong table. Everybody looked ashamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“She’s right,” Pollux said at last. “Accusing each other doesn’t help. We need
                        to keep our eyes
                        open for a silver necklace with a scythe charm. If Kronos had one, the spy probably does too.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Michael Yew grunted. “We need to find this spy before we plan our next
                        operation. Blowing up
                        the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda </i>won’t stop Kronos forever.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No indeed,” Chiron said. “In fact his next assault is already on the way.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I scowled. “You mean the ‘bigger threat’ Poseidon mentioned?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He and Annabeth looked at each other like, <i class="calibre5">It’s time</i>.
                        Did I mention I
                        hate it when they do that? </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy,” Chiron said, “we didn’t want to tell you until you returned to camp.
                        You needed a
                        break with your…mortal friends.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth blushed. It dawned on me that she knew I’d been hanging out with
                        Rachel, and I felt
                        guilty. Then I felt angry that I felt guilty. I was allowed to have friends outside camp, right?
                        It wasn’t like…
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Tell me what’s happened,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron picked up a bronze goblet from the snack table. He tossed water onto the
                        hot plate where
                        we usually melted nacho cheese. Steam billowed up, making a rainbow in the fluorescent lights.
                        Chiron fished a
                        golden drachma out of his pouch, tossed it through the mist, and muttered, “O Iris, Goddess of
                        the Rainbow, show
                        us the threat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The mist shimmered. I saw the familiar image of a smoldering volcano—Mount St.
                        Helens. As I
                        watched, the side of the mountain exploded. Fire, ash, and lava rolled out. A newscaster’s voice
                        was saying <i class="calibre5">“—even larger than last year’s eruption, and geologists warn that
                            the mountain may not be
                            done.” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I knew all about last year’s eruption. I’d caused it. But this explosion was
                        much worse. The
                        mountain tore itself apart, collapsing inward, and an enormous form rose out of the smoke and
                        lava like it was
                        emerging from a manhole. I hoped the Mist would keep the humans from seeing it clearly, because
                        what I saw
                        would’ve caused panic and riots across the entire United States. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The giant was bigger than anything I’d ever encountered. Even my demigod eyes
                        couldn’t make out
                        its exact form through the ash and fire, but it was vaguely humanoid and so huge it could’ve
                        used the Chrysler
                        Building as a baseball bat. The mountain shook with a horrible rumbling, as if the monster were
                        laughing. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/3-12.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“It’s him,” I said. “Typhon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was seriously hoping Chiron would say something good, like <i
                            class="calibre5">No, that’s our
                            huge friend Leroy! He’s going to help us! </i>But no such luck. He simply nodded. “The most
                        horrible monster
                        of all, the biggest single threat the gods ever faced. He has been freed from under the mountain
                        at last. But
                        this scene is from two days ago. <i class="calibre5">Here </i>is what is happening today.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron waved his hand and the image changed. I saw a bank of storm clouds
                        rolling across the
                        Midwest plains. Lightning flickered. Lines of tornadoes destroyed everything in their
                        path—ripping up houses and
                        trailers, tossing cars around like Matchbox toys. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“Monumental floods,” </i>an announcer was saying. <i
                            class="calibre5">“Five
                            states declared disaster areas as the freak storm system sweeps east, continuing its path of
                            destruction.”
                        </i>The cameras zoomed in on a column of storm bearing down on some Midwest city. I couldn’t
                        tell which one.
                        Inside the storm I could see the giant—just small glimpses of his true form: a smoky arm, a dark
                        clawed hand the
                        size of a city block. His angry roar rolled across the plains like a nuclear blast. Other
                        smaller forms darted
                        through the clouds, circling the monster. I saw flashes of light, and I realized the giant was
                        trying to swat
                        them. I squinted and thought I saw a golden chariot flying into the blackness. Then some kind of
                        huge bird—a
                        monstrous owl—dived in to attack the giant. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Are those…the gods?” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Yes, Percy,” Chiron said. “They have been fighting him for days now, trying to
                        slow him down.
                        But Typhon is marching forward—toward New York. Toward Olympus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I let that sink in. “How long until he gets here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Unless the gods can stop him? Perhaps five days. Most of the Olympians are
                        there…except your
                        father, who has a war of his own to fight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“But then who’s guarding Olympus?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Connor Stoll shook his head. “If Typhon gets to New York, it won’t matter who’s
                        guarding
                        Olympus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I thought about Kronos’s words on the ship: <i class="calibre5">I would love to
                            see the terror
                            in your eyes when you realize how I will destroy Olympus. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Was this what he was talking about: an attack by Typhon? It was sure terrifying
                        enough. But
                        Kronos was always fooling us, misdirecting our attention. This seemed too obvious for him. And
                        in my dream, the
                        golden Titan had talked about several more challenges to come, as if Typhon were only the first.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It’s a trick,” I said. “We have to warn the gods. Something else is going to
                        happen.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Chiron looked at me gravely. “Something worse than Typhon? I hope not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We have to defend Olympus,” I insisted. “Kronos has another attack planned.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“He did,” Travis Stoll reminded me. “But you sunk his ship.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Everyone was looking at me. They wanted some good news. They wanted to believe
                        that at least
                        I’d given them a little bit of hope. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glanced at Annabeth. I could tell we were thinking the same thing: What if
                        the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda </i>was a ploy? What if Kronos <i
                            class="calibre5">let </i>us blow up
                        that ship so we’d lower our guard? </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But I wasn’t going to say that in front of Silena. Her boyfriend had sacrificed
                        himself for
                        that mission. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Maybe you’re right,” I said, though I didn’t believe it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I tried to imagine how things could get much worse. The gods were in the
                        Midwest fighting a
                        huge monster that had almost defeated them once before. Poseidon was under siege and losing a
                        war against the
                        sea Titan Oceanus. Kronos was still out there somewhere. Olympus was virtually undefended. The
                        demigods of Camp
                        Half-Blood were on our own with a spy in our midst. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Oh, and according to the ancient prophecy, I was going to die when I turned
                        sixteen—which
                        happened to be in five days, the exact same time Typhon was supposed to hit New York. Almost
                        forgot that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Well,” Chiron said, “I think that’s enough for one night.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He waved his hand and the steam dissipated. The stormy battle of Typhon and the
                        gods
                        disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“That’s an understatement,” I muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">And the war council adjourned. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">I dreamed Rachel Elizabeth Dare was throwing darts at my picture. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She was standing in her room…Okay, back up. I have to explain that Rachel
                        doesn’t have a room.
                        She has the top floor of her family’s mansion, which is a renovated brownstone in Brooklyn. Her
                        “room” is a huge
                        loft with industrial lighting and floor-to-ceiling windows. It’s about twice as big as my mom’s
                        apartment. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Some alt rock was blaring from her paint-covered Bose docking system. As far as
                        I could tell,
                        Rachel’s only rule about music was that no two songs on her iPod could sound the same, and they
                        all had to be
                        strange. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She wore a kimono, and her hair was frizzy, like she’d been sleeping. Her bed
                        was messed up.
                        Sheets hung over a bunch of artist’s easels. Dirty clothes and old energy bar wrappers were
                        strewn around the
                        floor, but when you’ve got a room that big, the mess doesn’t look so bad. Out the windows you
                        could see the
                        entire nighttime skyline of Manhattan. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/4-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">The picture she was attacking was a painting of me standing over the giant
                        Antaeus. Rachel had
                        painted it a couple of months ago. My expression in the picture was fierce—disturbing, even—so
                        it was hard to
                        tell if I was the good guy or the bad guy, but Rachel said I’d looked just like that after the
                        battle. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/4-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“<i class="calibre5">Demigods</i>,” Rachel muttered as she threw another dart
                        at the canvas.
                        “And their <i class="calibre5">stupid </i>quests.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Most of the darts bounced off, but a few stuck. One hung off my chin like a
                        goatee. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Someone pounded on her bedroom door. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Rachel!” a man shouted. “What in the world are you doing? Turn off that—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Rachel scooped up her remote control and shut off the music. “Come in!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her dad walked in, scowling and blinking from the light. He had rust-colored
                        hair a little
                        darker than Rachel’s. It was smushed on one side like he’d lost a fight with his pillow. His
                        blue silk pajamas
                        had “WD” monogrammed on the pocket. Seriously, who has monogrammed pajamas? </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/4-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“What is going on?” he demanded. “It’s three in the morning.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Couldn’t sleep,” Rachel said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">On the painting, a dart fell off my face. Rachel hid the rest behind her back,
                        but Mr. Dare
                        noticed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So…I take it your friend isn’t coming to St. Thomas?” That’s what Mr. Dare
                        called me. Never <i class="calibre5">Percy</i>. Just <i class="calibre5">your friend</i>. Or <i
                            class="calibre5">young man
                        </i>if he was talking to me, which he rarely did. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Rachel knit her eyebrows. “I don’t know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We leave in the morning,” her dad said. “If he hasn’t made up his mind yet—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“He’s probably not coming,” Rachel said miserably. “Happy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mr. Dare put his hands behind his back. He paced the room with a stern
                        expression. I imagined
                        he did that in the boardroom of his land development company and made his employees nervous.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Are you still having bad dreams?” he asked. “Headaches?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Rachel threw her darts on the floor. “I should never have told you about that.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’m your father,” he said. “I’m worried about you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Worried about the family’s reputation,” Rachel muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her father didn’t react—maybe because he’d heard that comment before, or maybe
                        because it was
                        true. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We could call Dr. Arkwright,” he suggested. “He helped you get through the
                        death of your
                        hamster.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I was six then,” she said. “And no, Dad, I don’t need a therapist. I just…”
                        She shook her head
                        helplessly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her father stopped in front of the windows. He gazed at the New York skyline as
                        if he owned
                        it—which wasn’t true. He only owned part of it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It will be good for you to get away,” he decided. “You’ve had some unhealthy
                        influences.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’m not going to Clarion Ladies Academy,” Rachel said. “And my friends are
                        none of your
                        business.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mr. Dare smiled, but it wasn’t a warm smile. It was more like, <i
                            class="calibre5">Someday
                            you’ll realize how silly you sound</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Try to get some sleep,” he urged. “We’ll be at the beach by tomorrow night. It
                        will be fun.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Fun,” Rachel repeated. “Lots of fun.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her father exited the room. He left the door open behind him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Rachel stared at the portrait of me. Then she walked to the easel next to it,
                        which was covered
                        in a sheet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I hope they’re dreams,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She uncovered the easel. On it was a hastily sketched charcoal, but Rachel was
                        a good artist.
                        The picture was definitely Luke as a young boy. He was about nine years old, with a wide grin
                        and no scar on his
                        face. I had no idea how Rachel could’ve known what he looked like back then, but the portrait
                        was so good I had
                        a feeling she wasn’t guessing. From what I knew about Luke’s life (which wasn’t much), the
                        picture showed him
                        just before he’d found out he was a half-blood and had run away from home. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/4-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Rachel stared at the portrait. Then she uncovered the next easel. This picture
                        was even more
                        disturbing. It showed the Empire State Building with lightning all around it. In the distance a
                        dark storm was
                        brewing, with a huge hand coming out of the clouds. At the base of the building a crowd had
                        gathered…but it
                        wasn’t a normal crowd of tourists and pedestrians. I saw spears, javelins, and banners—the
                        trappings of an army.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/4-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy,” Rachel muttered, as if she knew I was listening, “what is going on?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The dream faded, and the last thing I remember was wishing I could answer her
                        question. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">The next morning, I wanted to call her, but there were no phones at camp.
                        Dionysus and Chiron
                        didn’t need a landline. They just called Olympus with an Iris-message whenever they needed
                        something. And when
                        demigods use cell phones, the signals agitate every monster within a hundred miles. It’s like
                        sending up a
                        flare: <i class="calibre5">Here I am! Please rearrange my face! </i>Even within the safe borders
                        of camp, that’s
                        not the kind of advertising we wanted to do. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Most demigods (except for Annabeth and a few others) don’t even own cell
                        phones. And I
                        definitely couldn’t tell Annabeth, “Hey, let me borrow your phone so I can call Rachel!” To make
                        the call, I
                        would’ve had to leave camp and walk several miles to the nearest convenience store. Even if
                        Chiron let me go, by
                        the time I got there, Rachel would’ve been on the plane to Saint Thomas. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I ate a depressing breakfast by myself at the Poseidon table. I kept staring at
                        the fissure in
                        the marble floor where two years ago Nico had banished a bunch of bloodthirsty skeletons to the
                        Underworld. The
                        memory didn’t exactly improve my appetite. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">After breakfast, Annabeth and I walked down to inspect the cabins. Actually, it
                        was Annabeth’s
                        turn for inspection. My morning chore was to sort through reports for Chiron. But since we both
                        hated our jobs,
                        we decided to do them together so it wouldn’t be so heinous. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We started at the Poseidon cabin, which was basically just me. I’d made my bunk
                        bed that
                        morning (well, sort of) and straightened the Minotaur horn on the wall, so I gave myself a four
                        out of five.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth made a face. “You’re being generous.” She used the end of her pencil
                        to pick up an old
                        pair of running shorts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I snatched them away. “Hey, give me a break. I don’t have Tyson cleaning up
                        after me this
                        summer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Three out of five,” Annabeth said. I knew better than to argue, so we moved
                        along. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I tried to skim through Chiron’s stack of reports as we walked. There were
                        messages from
                        demigods, nature spirits, and satyrs all around the country, writing about the latest monster
                        activity. They
                        were pretty depressing, and my ADHD brain did <i class="calibre5">not </i>like concentrating on
                        depressing
                        stuff. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Little battles were raging everywhere. Camp recruitment was down to zero.
                        Satyrs were having
                        trouble finding new demigods and bringing them to Half-Blood Hill because so many monsters were
                        roaming the
                        country. Our friend Thalia, who led the Hunters of Artemis, hadn’t been heard from in months,
                        and if Artemis
                        knew what had happened to them, she wasn’t sharing information. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We visited the Aphrodite cabin, which of course got a five out of five. The
                        beds were perfectly
                        made. The clothes in everyone’s footlockers were color coordinated. Fresh flowers bloomed on the
                        windowsills. I
                        wanted to dock a point because the whole place reeked of designer perfume, but Annabeth ignored
                        me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Great job as usual, Silena,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Silena nodded listlessly. The wall behind her bed was decorated with pictures
                        of Beckendorf.
                        She sat on her bunk with a box of chocolates on her lap, and I remembered that her dad owned a
                        chocolate store
                        in the Village, which was how he’d caught the attention of Aphrodite. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/4-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“You want a bonbon?” Silena asked. “My dad sent them. He thought—he thought
                        they might cheer me
                        up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Are they any good?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She shook her head. “They taste like cardboard.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t have anything against cardboard, so I tried one. Annabeth passed. We
                        promised to see
                        Silena later and kept going. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">As we crossed the commons area, a fight broke out between the Ares and Apollo
                        cabins. Some
                        Apollo campers armed with firebombs flew over the Ares cabin in a chariot pulled by two pegasi.
                        I’d never seen
                        the chariot before, but it looked like a pretty sweet ride. Soon, the roof of the Ares cabin was
                        burning, and
                        naiads from the canoe lake rushed over to blow water on it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then the Ares campers called down a curse, and all the Apollo kids’ arrows
                        turned to rubber.
                        The Apollo kids kept shooting at the Ares kids, but the arrows bounced off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Two archers ran by, chased by an angry Ares kid who was yelling in poetry:
                        “Curse me, eh? I’ll
                        make you pay! / I don’t want to rhyme all day!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth sighed. “Not that again. Last time Apollo cursed a cabin, it took a
                        week for the
                        rhyming couplets to wear off.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shuddered. Apollo was god of poetry as well as archery, and I’d heard him
                        recite in person.
                        I’d almost rather get shot by an arrow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What are they fighting about anyway?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth ignored me while she scribbled on her inspection scroll, giving both
                        cabins a one out
                        of five. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I found myself staring at her, which was stupid since I’d seen her a billion
                        times. She and I
                        were about the same height this summer, which was a relief. Still, she seemed so much more
                        mature. It was kind
                        of intimidating. I mean, sure, she’d always been cute, but she was starting to be seriously
                        beautiful. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/4-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Finally she said, “That flying chariot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You asked what they were fighting about.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh. Oh, right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“They captured it in a raid in Philadelphia last week. Some of Luke’s demigods
                        were there with
                        that flying chariot. The Apollo cabin seized it during the battle, but the Ares cabin led the
                        raid. So they’ve
                        been fighting about who gets it ever since.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We ducked as Michael Yew’s chariot dive-bombed an Ares camper. The Ares camper
                        tried to stab
                        him and cuss him out in rhyming couplets. He was pretty creative about rhyming those cuss words.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We’re fighting for our lives,” I said, “and they’re bickering about some
                        stupid chariot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“They’ll get over it,” Annabeth said. “Clarisse will come to her senses.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wasn’t so sure. That didn’t sound like the Clarisse I knew. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I scanned more reports and we inspected a few more cabins. Demeter got a four.
                        Hephaestus got a
                        three and probably should’ve gotten lower, but with Beckendorf being gone and all, we cut them
                        some slack.
                        Hermes got a two, which was no surprise. All campers who didn’t know their godly parentage were
                        shoved into the
                        Hermes cabin, and since the gods were kind of forgetful, that cabin was always overcrowded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Finally we got to Athena’s cabin, which was orderly and clean as usual. Books
                        were straightened
                        on the shelves. The armor was polished. Battle maps and blueprints decorated the walls. Only
                        Annabeth’s bunk was
                        messy. It was covered in papers, and her silver laptop was still running. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“Vlacas,” </i>Annabeth muttered, which was basically
                        calling herself an
                        idiot in Greek. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her second-in-command, Malcolm, suppressed a smile. “Yeah, um…we cleaned
                        everything else.
                        Didn’t know if it was safe to move your notes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">That was probably smart. Annabeth had a bronze knife that she reserved just for
                        monsters and
                        people who messed with her stuff. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Malcolm grinned at me. “We’ll wait outside while you finish inspection.” The
                        Athena campers
                        filed out the door while Annabeth cleaned up her bunk. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/4-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">I shuffled uneasily and pretended to go through some more reports. Technically,
                        even on
                        inspection, it was against camp rules for two campers to be…like, <i class="calibre5">alone
                        </i>in a cabin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">That rule had come up a lot when Silena and Beckendorf started dating. And I
                        know some of you
                        might be thinking, Aren’t all demigods related on the godly side, and doesn’t that make dating
                        gross? But the
                        thing is, the godly side of your family doesn’t count, genetically speaking, since gods don’t
                        have DNA. A
                        demigod would never think about dating someone who had the same godly parent. Like two kids from
                        Athena cabin?
                        No way. But a daughter of Aphrodite and a son of Hephaestus? They’re not related. So it’s no
                        problem. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Anyway, for some strange reason I was thinking about this as I watched Annabeth
                        straighten up.
                        She closed her laptop, which had been given to her as a gift from the inventor Daedalus last
                        summer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I cleared my throat. “So…get any good info from that thing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Too much,” she said. “Daedalus had so many ideas, I could spend fifty years
                        just trying to
                        figure them all out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Yeah,” I muttered. “That would be fun.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She shuffled her papers—mostly drawings of buildings and a bunch of handwritten
                        notes. I knew
                        she wanted to be an architect someday, but I’d learned the hard way not to ask what she was
                        working on. She’d
                        start talking about angles and load-bearing joints until my eyes glazed over. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You know…” She brushed her hair behind her ear, like she does when she’s
                        nervous. “This whole
                        thing with Beckendorf and Silena. It kind of makes you think. About…what’s important. About
                        losing people who
                        are important.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nodded. My brain started seizing on little random details, like the fact that
                        she was still
                        wearing those silver owl earrings from her dad, who was this brainiac military history professor
                        in San
                        Francisco. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Um, yeah,” I stammered. “Like…is everything cool with your family?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Okay, really stupid question, but hey, I was nervous. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth looked disappointed, but she nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“My dad wanted to take me to Greece this summer,” she said wistfully. “I’ve
                        always wanted to
                        see—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The Parthenon,” I remembered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She managed a smile. “Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“That’s okay. There’ll be other summers, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">As soon as I said it, I realized it was a boneheaded comment. I was facing the
                        <i class="calibre5">end of my days</i>. Within a week, Olympus might fall. If the Age of the
                        Gods really did
                        end, the world as we knew it would dissolve into chaos. Demigods would be hunted to extinction.
                        There would be
                        no more summers for us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth stared at her inspection scroll. “Three out five,” she muttered, “for
                        a sloppy head
                        counselor. Come on. Let’s finish your reports and get back to Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">On the way to the Big House, we read the last report, which was handwritten on
                        a maple leaf
                        from a satyr in Canada. If possible, the note made me feel even worse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“‘Dear Grover,’” I read aloud. “‘Woods outside Toronto attacked by giant evil
                        badger. Tried to
                        do as you suggested and summon power of Pan. No effect. Many naiads’ trees destroyed. Retreating
                        to Ottawa.
                        Please advise. Where are you? —Gleeson Hedge, protector.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth grimaced. “You haven’t heard <i class="calibre5">anything </i>from
                        him? Even with your
                        empathy link?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shook my head dejectedly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Ever since last summer when the god Pan had died, our friend Grover had been
                        drifting farther
                        and farther away. The Council of Cloven Elders treated him like an outcast, but Grover still
                        traveled all over
                        the East Coast, trying to spread the word about Pan and convince nature spirits to protect their
                        own little bits
                        of the wild. He’d only come back to camp a few times to see his girlfriend, Juniper. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Last I’d heard he was in Central Park organizing the dryads, but nobody had
                        seen or heard from
                        him in two months. We’d tried to send Iris-messages. They never got through. I had an empathy
                        link with Grover,
                        so I hoped I would know if anything bad happened to him. Grover had told me one time that if he
                        died, the
                        empathy link might kill me too. But I wasn’t sure if that was still true or not. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wondered if he was still in Manhattan. Then I thought about my dream of
                        Rachel’s sketch—dark
                        clouds closing on the city, an army gathered around the Empire State Building. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Annabeth.” I stopped her by the tetherball court. I knew I was asking for
                        trouble, but I
                        didn’t know who else to trust. Plus, I’d always depended on Annabeth for advice. “Listen, I had
                        this dream
                        about, um, Rachel…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I told her the whole thing, even the weird picture of Luke as a child. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For a while she didn’t say anything. Then she rolled up her inspection scroll
                        so tight she
                        ripped it. “What do you want me to say?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’m not sure. You’re the best strategist I know. If you were Kronos planning
                        this war, what
                        would you do next?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’d use Typhon as a distraction. Then I’d hit Olympus directly, while the gods
                        were in the
                        West.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Just like in Rachel’s picture.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy,” she said, her voice tight, “Rachel is just a mortal.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“But what if her dream is true? Those other Titans— they said Olympus would be
                        destroyed in a
                        matter of days. They said they had plenty of other challenges. And what’s with that picture of
                        Luke as a kid—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We’ll just have to be ready.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“How?” I said. “Look at our camp. We can’t even stop fighting each other. And
                        I’m supposed to
                        get my stupid soul reaped.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She threw down her scroll. “I knew we shouldn’t have shown you the prophecy.”
                        Her voice was
                        angry and hurt. “All it did was scare you. You run away from things when you’re scared.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stared at her, completely stunned. “<i class="calibre5">Me</i>? Run away?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She got right in my face. “Yes, you. You’re a coward, Percy Jackson!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We were nose to nose. Her eyes were red, and I suddenly realized that when she
                        called me a
                        coward, maybe she wasn’t talking about the prophecy. </p>

                    <p class="calibre15">“If you don’t like our chances,” she said, “maybe you should go on that
                        vacation with Rachel.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Annabeth—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“If you don’t like our company.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“That’s not fair!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She pushed past me and stormed toward the strawberry fields. She hit the
                        tetherball as she
                        passed and sent it spinning angrily around the pole. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">I’d like to say my day got better from there. Of course it didn’t. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">That afternoon we had an assembly at the campfire to burn Beckendorf’s burial
                        shroud and say
                        our good-byes. Even the Ares and Apollo cabins called a temporary truce to attend. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Beckendorf’s shroud was made out of metal links, like chain mail. I didn’t see
                        how it would
                        burn, but the Fates must’ve been helping out. The metal melted in the fire and turned to golden
                        smoke, which
                        rose into the sky. The campfire flames always reflected the campers’ moods, and today they
                        burned black. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hoped Beckendorf’s spirit would end up in Elysium. Maybe he’d even choose to
                        be reborn and
                        try for Elysium in three different lifetimes so he could reach the Isles of the Blest, which was
                        like the
                        Underworld’s ultimate party headquarters. If anyone deserved it, Beckendorf did. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth left without a word to me. Most of the other campers drifted off to
                        their afternoon
                        activities. I just stood there staring at the dying fire. Silena sat nearby crying, while
                        Clarisse and her
                        boyfriend, Chris Rodriguez, tried to comfort her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Finally I got up the nerve to walk over. “Hey, Silena, I’m really sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She sniffled. Clarisse glared at me, but she always glares at everyone. Chris
                        would barely look
                        at me. He’d been one of Luke’s men until Clarisse rescued him from the Labyrinth last summer,
                        and I guess he
                        still felt guilty about it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I cleared my throat. “Silena, you know Beckendorf carried your picture. He
                        looked at it right
                        before we went into battle. You meant a lot to him. You made the last year the best of his
                        life.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Silena sobbed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Good work, Percy,” Clarisse muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No, it’s all right,” Silena said. “Thank…thank you, Percy. I should go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You want company?” Clarisse asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Silena shook her head and ran off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“She’s stronger than she looks,” Clarisse muttered, almost to herself. “She’ll
                        survive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You could help with that,” I suggested. “You could honor Beckendorf’s memory
                        by fighting with
                        us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Clarisse went for her knife, but it wasn’t there anymore. She’d thrown it on
                        the Ping-Pong
                        table in the Big House. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Not my problem,” she growled. “My cabin doesn’t get honor, I don’t fight.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I noticed she wasn’t speaking in rhymes. Maybe she hadn’t been around when her
                        cabinmates got
                        cursed, or maybe she had a way of breaking the spell. With a chill, I wondered if Clarisse could
                        be Kronos’s spy
                        at camp. Was that why she was keeping her cabin out of the fight? But as much as I disliked
                        Clarisse, spying for
                        the Titans didn’t seem like her style. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“All right,” I told her. “I didn’t want to bring this up, but you owe me one.
                        You’d be rotting
                        in a Cyclops’s cave in the Sea of Monsters if it wasn’t for me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She clenched her jaw. “Any other favor, Percy. Not this. The Ares cabin has
                        been dissed too
                        many times. And don’t think I don’t know what people say about me behind my back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wanted to say, <i class="calibre5">Well, it’s true</i>. But I bit my tongue.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So, what—you’re just going to let Kronos crush us?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“If you want my help so bad, tell Apollo to give us the chariot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You’re such a big baby.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She charged me, but Chris got between us. “Whoa, guys,” he said. “Clarisse, you
                        know, maybe
                        he’s got a point.” </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">She sneered at him. “Not you too!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She trudged off with Chris at her heels. “Hey, wait! I just meant—Clarisse,
                        wait!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I watched the last sparks from Beckendorf’s fire curl into the afternoon sky.
                        Then I headed
                        toward the sword-fighting arena. I needed a break, and I wanted to see an old friend. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">Mrs. O’Leary saw me before I saw her, which was a pretty good trick considering
                        she’s the size
                        of a garbage truck. I walked into the arena, and a wall of darkness slammed into me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“WOOF!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The next thing I knew I was flat on the ground with a huge paw on my chest and
                        an oversized
                        Brillo pad tongue licking my face. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/5-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Ow!” I said. “Hey, girl. Good to see you too. Ow!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It took a few minutes for Mrs. O’Leary to calm down and get off me. By then I
                        was pretty much
                        drenched in dog drool. She wanted to play fetch, so I picked up a bronze shield and tossed it
                        across the arena.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">By the way, Mrs. O’Leary is the world’s only friendly hellhound. I kind of
                        inherited her when
                        her previous owner died. She lived at camp, but Beckendorf…well, Beckendorf <i
                            class="calibre5">used to </i>take
                        care of her whenever I was gone. He had smelted Mrs. O’Leary’s favorite bronze chewing bone.
                        He’d forged her
                        collar with the little smiley face and a crossbones name tag. Next to me, Beckendorf had been
                        her best friend.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Thinking about that made me sad all over again, but I threw the shield a few
                        more times because
                        Mrs. O’Leary insisted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Soon she started barking—a sound slightly louder than an artillery gun—like she
                        needed to go
                        for a walk. The other campers didn’t think it was funny when she went to the bathroom in the
                        arena. It had
                        caused more than one unfortunate slip-and-slide accident. So I opened the gates of the arena,
                        and she bounded
                        straight toward the woods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I jogged after her, not too concerned that she was getting ahead. Nothing in
                        the woods could
                        threaten Mrs. O’Leary. Even the dragons and giant scorpions ran away when she came close. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When I finally tracked her down, she wasn’t using the facilities. She was in a
                        familiar
                        clearing where the Council of Cloven Elders had once put Grover on trial. The place didn’t look
                        so good. The
                        grass had turned yellow. The three topiary thrones had lost all their leaves. But that’s not
                        what surprised me.
                        In the middle of the glade stood the weirdest trio I’d ever seen: Juniper the tree nymph, Nico
                        di Angelo, and a
                        very old, very fat satyr. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/5-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico was the only one who didn’t seem freaked out by Mrs. O’Leary’s appearance.
                        He looked
                        pretty much like I’d seen him in my dream—an aviator’s jacket, black jeans, and a T-shirt with
                        dancing skeletons
                        on it, like one of those Day of the Dead pictures. His Stygian iron sword hung at his side. He
                        was only twelve,
                        but he looked much older and sadder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He nodded when he saw me, then went back to scratching Mrs. O’Leary’s ears. She
                        sniffed his
                        legs like he was the most interesting thing since rib-eye steaks. Being the son of Hades, he’d
                        probably been
                        traveling in all sorts of hellhound-friendly places. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The old satyr didn’t look nearly so happy. “Will someone—what is this <i
                            class="calibre5">underworld </i>creature doing in my forest!” He waved his arms and trotted
                        on his hooves as
                        if the grass were hot. “You there, Percy Jackson! Is this your beast?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Sorry, Leneus,” I said. “That’s your name, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The satyr rolled his eyes. His fur was dust-bunny gray, and a spiderweb grew
                        between his horns.
                        His belly would’ve made him an invincible bumper car. “Well, of course I’m Leneus. Don’t tell me
                        you’ve
                        forgotten a member of the Council so quickly. Now, call off your beast!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“WOOF!” </i>Mrs. O’Leary said happily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The old satyr gulped. “Make it go away! Juniper, I will not help you under
                        these
                        circumstances!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Juniper turned toward me. She was pretty in a dryad-y way, with her purple
                        gossamer dress and
                        her elfish face, but her eyes were green-tinted with chlorophyll from crying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy,” she sniffled. “I was just asking about Grover. I <i
                            class="calibre5">know
                        </i>something’s happened. He wouldn’t stay gone this long if he wasn’t in trouble. I was hoping
                        that Leneus—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I told you!” the satyr protested. “You are a better off without that traitor.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Juniper stamped her foot. “He is not a traitor! He’s the bravest satyr ever,
                        and I want to know
                        where he is!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“WOOF!” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Leneus’s knees started knocking. “I…I won’t answer questions with this
                        hellhound sniffing my
                        tail!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico looked like he was trying to not crack up. “I’ll walk the dog,” he
                        volunteered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He whistled, and Mrs. O’Leary bounded after him to the far end of the grove.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Leneus huffed indignantly and brushed the twigs off his shirt. “Now, as I was
                        trying to
                        explain, young lady, your boyfriend has not sent <i class="calibre5">any </i>reports since we
                        voted him into
                        exile.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You <i class="calibre5">tried </i>to vote him into exile,” I corrected.
                        “Chiron and Dionysus
                        stopped you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Bah! They are <i class="calibre5">honorary </i>Council members. It wasn’t a
                        proper vote.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’ll tell Dionysus you said that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Leneus paled. “I only meant…Now see here, Jackson. This is none of your
                        business.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Grover’s my friend,” I said. “He wasn’t lying to you about Pan’s death. I saw
                        it myself. You
                        were just too scared to accept the truth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Leneus’s lips quivered. “No! Grover’s a liar and good riddance. We’re better
                        off without him.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I pointed at the withered thrones. “If things are going so well, where are your
                        friends? Looks
                        like your Council hasn’t been meeting lately.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Maron and Silenus…I…I’m sure they’ll be back,” he said, but I could hear the
                        panic in his
                        voice. “They’re just taking some time off to think. It’s been a very unsettling year.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It’s going to get a lot more unsettling,” I promised. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Leneus, we <i class="calibre5">need </i>Grover. There’s got to be a way you
                        can find him with
                        your magic.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The old satyr’s eye twitched. “I’m telling you, I’ve heard nothing. Perhaps
                        he’s dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Juniper choked back a sob. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“He’s not dead,” I said. “I can feel that much.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Empathy links,” Leneus said disdainfully. “Very unreliable.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So ask around,” I insisted. “Find him. There’s a war coming. Grover was
                        preparing the nature
                        spirits.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Without my permission! And it’s not <i class="calibre5">our </i>war.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I grabbed him by the shirt, which seriously wasn’t like me, but the stupid old
                        goat was making
                        me mad. “Listen, Leneus. When Kronos attacks, he’s going to have <i class="calibre5">packs
                        </i>of hellhounds.
                        He’s going to destroy everything in his path— mortals, gods, demigods. Do you think he’ll let
                        the satyrs go
                        free? You’re supposed to be a leader. So LEAD. Get out there and see what’s happening. Find
                        Grover and bring
                        Juniper some news. Now, GO!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/5-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t push him very hard, but he was kind of top-heavy. He fell on his furry
                        rump, then
                        scrambled to his hooves and ran away with his belly jiggling. “Grover will never be accepted! He
                        will die an
                        outcast!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When he’d disappeared into the bushes, Juniper wiped her eyes. “I’m sorry,
                        Percy. I didn’t mean
                        to get you involved. Leneus is still a lord of the Wild. You don’t want to make an enemy of
                        him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No problem,” I said. “I’ve got worse enemies than overweight satyrs.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico walked back to us. “Good job, Percy. Judging from the trail of goat
                        pellets, I’d say you
                        shook him up pretty well.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was afraid I knew why Nico was here, but I tried for a smile. “Welcome back.
                        Did you come by
                        just to see Juniper?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He blushed. “Um, no. That was an accident. I kind of…dropped into the middle of
                        their
                        conversation.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“He scared us to death!” Juniper said. “Right out of the shadows. But, Nico,
                        you <i class="calibre5">are </i>the son of Hades and all. Are you sure you haven’t heard
                        anything about Grover?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico shifted his weight. “Juniper, like I tried to tell you…even if Grover
                        died, he would
                        reincarnate into something else in nature. I can’t sense things like that, only mortal souls.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“But if you <i class="calibre5">do </i>hear anything?” she pleaded, putting her
                        hand on his
                        arm. “Anything at all?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico’s cheeks got even brighter red. “Uh, you bet. I’ll keep my ears open.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We’ll find him, Juniper,” I promised. “Grover’s alive, I’m sure. There must be
                        a simple reason
                        why he hasn’t contacted us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She nodded glumly. “I hate not being able to leave the forest. He could be
                        anywhere, and I’m
                        stuck here waiting. Oh, if that silly goat has gotten himself hurt—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mrs. O’Leary bounded back over and took an interest in Juniper’s dress. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/5-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Juniper yelped. “Oh, no you don’t! I know about dogs and trees. I’m gone!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She went <i class="calibre5">poof </i>into green mist. Mrs. O’Leary looked
                        disappointed, but
                        she lumbered off to find another target, leaving Nico and me alone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico tapped his sword on the ground. A tiny mound of animal bones erupted from
                        the dirt. They
                        knit themselves together into a skeletal field mouse and scampered off. “I was sorry to hear
                        about Beckendorf.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A lump formed in my throat. “How did you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I talked to his ghost.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh…right.” I’d never get used to the fact that this twelve-year-old kid spent
                        more time
                        talking with the dead than the living. “Did he say anything?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“He doesn’t blame you. He figured you’d be beating yourself up, and he said you
                        shouldn’t.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Is he going to try for rebirth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico shook his head. “He’s staying in Elysium. Said he’s waiting for someone.
                        Not sure what he
                        meant, but he seems okay with death.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It wasn’t much comfort, but it was something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I had a vision you were on Mount Tam,” I told Nico. “Was that—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Real,” he said. “I didn’t mean to be spying on the Titans, but I was in the
                        neighborhood.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Doing what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico tugged at his sword belt. “Following a lead on…you know, my family.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nodded. I knew his past was a painful subject. Until two years ago, he and
                        his sister Bianca
                        had been frozen in time at a place called the Lotus Hotel and Casino. They’d been there for like
                        seventy years.
                        Eventually a mysterious lawyer rescued them and checked them into a boarding school, but Nico
                        had no memories of
                        his life before the casino. He didn’t know anything about his mother. He didn’t know who the
                        lawyer was, or why
                        they’d been frozen in time or allowed to go free. After Bianca died and left Nico alone, he’d
                        been obsessed with
                        finding answers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So how did it go?” I asked. “Any luck?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No,” he murmured. “But I may have a new lead soon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What’s the lead?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico chewed his lip. “That’s not important right now. You know why I’m here.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A feeling of dread started to build in my chest. Ever since Nico first proposed
                        his plan for
                        beating Kronos last summer, I’d had nightmares about it. He would show up occasionally and press
                        me for an
                        answer, but I kept putting him off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Nico, I don’t know,” I said. “It seems pretty extreme.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You’ve got Typhon coming in, what…a week? Most of the other Titans are
                        unleashed now and on
                        Kronos’s side. Maybe it’s time to think extreme.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I looked back toward the camp. Even from this distance I could hear the Ares
                        and Apollo campers
                        fighting again, yelling curses and spouting bad poetry. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“They’re no match for the Titan army,” Nico said. “You know that. This comes
                        down to you and
                        Luke. And there’s only one way you can beat Luke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I remembered the fight on the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>. I’d
                        been hopelessly
                        outmatched. Kronos had almost killed me with a single cut to my arm, and I couldn’t even wound
                        him. Riptide had
                        glanced right off his skin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We can give you the same power,” Nico urged. “You heard the Great Prophecy.
                        Unless you want to
                        have your soul reaped by a cursed blade…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wondered how Nico had heard the prophecy— probably from some ghost. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You can’t prevent a prophecy,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“But you can fight it.” Nico had a strange, hungry light in his eyes. “You can
                        become
                        invincible.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Maybe we should wait. Try to fight without—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No!” Nico snarled. “It has to be now!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/5-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">I stared at him. I hadn’t seen his temper flare like that in a long time. “Um,
                        you sure you’re
                        okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He took a deep breath. “Percy, all I mean…when the fighting starts, we won’t be
                        able to make
                        the journey. This is our last chance. I’m sorry if I’m being too pushy, but two years ago my
                        sister gave her
                        life to protect you. I want you to honor that. Do whatever it takes to stay alive and defeat
                        Kronos.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t like the idea. Then I thought about Annabeth calling me a coward, and
                        I got angry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico had a point. If Kronos attacked New York, the campers would be no match
                        for his forces. I
                        had to do something. Nico’s way was dangerous—maybe even deadly. But it might give me a fighting
                        edge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“All right,” I decided. “What do we do first?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His cold creepy smile made me sorry I’d agreed. “First we’ll need to retrace
                        Luke’s steps. We
                        need to know more about his past, his childhood.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shuddered, thinking about Rachel’s picture from my dream—a smiling
                        nine-year-old Luke. “Why
                        do we need to know about that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’ll explain when we get there,” Nico said. “I’ve already tracked down his
                        mother. She lives
                        in Connecticut.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stared at him. I’d never thought much about Luke’s mortal parent. I’d met his
                        dad, Hermes,
                        but his mom…</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Luke ran away when he was really young,” I said. “I didn’t think his mom was
                        alive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, she’s alive.” The way he said it made me wonder what was wrong with her.
                        What kind of
                        horrible person could she be? </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Okay…” I said. “So how do we get to Connecticut? I can call Blackjack—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No.” Nico scowled. “Pegasi don’t like me, and the feeling is mutual. But
                        there’s no need for
                        flying.” He whistled, and Mrs. O’Leary came loping out of the woods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Your friend here can help.” Nico patted her head. “You haven’t tried shadow
                        travel yet?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Shadow travel?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico whispered in Mrs. O’Leary’s ear. She tilted her head, suddenly alert. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Hop on board,” Nico told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I’d never considered riding a dog before, but Mrs. O’Leary was certainly big
                        enough. I climbed
                        onto her back and held her collar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“This will make her very tired,” Nico warned, “so you can’t do it often. And it
                        works best at
                        night. But all shadows are part of the same substance. There is only one darkness, and creatures
                        of the
                        Underworld can use it as a road, or a door.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I don’t understand,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No,” Nico said. “It took me a long time to learn. But Mrs. O’Leary knows. Tell
                        her where to
                        go. Tell her Westport, the home of May Castellan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You’re not coming?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Don’t worry,” he said. “I’ll meet you there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was a little nervous, but I leaned down to Mrs. O’Leary’s ear. “Okay, girl.
                        Uh, can you take
                        me to Westport, Connecticut? May Castellan’s place?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mrs. O’Leary sniffed the air. She looked into the gloom of the forest. Then she
                        bounded
                        forward, straight into an oak tree. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Just before we hit, we passed into shadows as cold as the dark side of the
                        moon. </p>

                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <small>
                        <p class="calibre15"> a) The dark </p>

                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="calibre15">In other words, I thought it was awesome. One minute I couldn’t see anything. I
                        could only feel
                        Mrs. O’Leary’s fur and my fingers wrapped around the bronze links of her dog collar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The next minute the shadows melted into a new scene. We were on a cliff in the
                        woods of
                        Connecticut. At least, it looked like Connecticut from the few times I’d been there: lots of
                        trees, low stone
                        walls, big houses. Down one side of the cliff, a highway cut through a ravine. Down the other
                        side was someone’s
                        backyard. The property was huge—more wilderness than lawn. The house was a two-story white
                        Colonial. Despite the
                        fact that it was right on the other side of the hill from a highway, it felt like it was in the
                        middle of
                        nowhere. I could see a light glowing in the kitchen window. A rusty old swing set stood under an
                        apple tree.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/6-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">I couldn’t imagine living in a house like this, with an actual yard and
                        everything. I’d lived
                        in a tiny apartment or a school dorm my whole life. If this was Luke’s home, I wondered why he’d
                        ever wanted to
                        leave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mrs. O’Leary staggered. I remembered what Nico had said about shadow travel
                        draining her, so I
                        slipped off her back. She let out a huge toothy yawn that would’ve scared a T. rex, then turned
                        in a circle and
                        flopped down so hard the ground shook. Nico appeared right next to me, as if the shadows had
                        darkened and
                        created him. He stumbled, but I caught his arm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’m okay,” he managed, rubbing his eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“How did you do that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Practice. A few times running into walls. A few accidental trips to China.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mrs. O’Leary started snoring. If it hadn’t been for the roar of traffic behind
                        us, I’m sure she
                        would’ve woken up the whole neighborhood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Are you going to take a nap too?” I asked Nico. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He shook his head. “The first time I shadow traveled, I passed out for a week.
                        Now it just
                        makes me a little drowsy, but I can’t do it more than once or twice a night. Mrs. O’Leary won’t
                        be going
                        anywhere for a while.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So we’ve got some quality time in Connecticut.” I gazed at the white Colonial
                        house. “What
                        now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We ring the doorbell,” Nico said. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">If I were Luke’s mom, I would not have opened my door at night for two strange
                        kids. But I
                        wasn’t <i class="calibre5">anything </i>like Luke’s mom. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I knew that even before we reached the front door. The sidewalk was lined with
                        those little
                        stuffed beanbag animals you see in gift shops. There were miniature lions, pigs, dragons,
                        hydras, even a teeny
                        Minotaur in a little Minotaur diaper. Judging from their sad shape, the beanbag creatures had
                        been sitting out
                        here a long time—since the snow melted last spring at least. One of the hydras had a tree
                        sapling sprouting
                        between its necks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The front porch was infested with wind chimes. Shiny bits of glass and metal
                        clinked in the
                        breeze. Brass ribbons tinkled like water and made me realize I needed to use the bathroom. I
                        didn’t know how Ms.
                        Castellan could stand all the noise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The front door was painted turquoise. The name CASTELLAN was written in
                        English, and below in
                        Greek: Διοικητής Φρουρίου.</p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/6-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico looked at me. “Ready?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He’d barely tapped the door when it swung open. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Luke!” the old lady cried happily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She looked like someone who enjoyed sticking her fingers in electrical sockets.
                        Her white hair
                        stuck out in tufts all over her head. Her pink housedress was covered in scorch marks and smears
                        of ash. When
                        she smiled, her face looked unnaturally stretched, and the high-voltage light in her eyes made
                        me wonder if she
                        was blind. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/6-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, my dear boy!” She hugged Nico. I was trying to figure out why she thought
                        Nico was Luke
                        (they looked absolutely nothing alike), when she smiled at me and said, “Luke!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She forgot all about Nico and gave me a hug. She smelled like burned cookies.
                        She was as thin
                        as a scarecrow, but that didn’t stop her from almost crushing me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Come in!” she insisted. “I have your lunch ready!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She ushered us inside. The living room was even weirder than the front lawn.
                        Mirrors and
                        candles filled every available space. I couldn’t look anywhere without seeing my own reflection.
                        Above the
                        mantel, a little bronze Hermes flew around the second hand of a ticking clock. I tried to
                        imagine the god of
                        messengers ever falling in love with this old woman, but the idea was too bizarre. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then I noticed the framed picture on the mantel, and I froze. It was exactly
                        like Rachel’s
                        sketch—Luke around nine years old, with blond hair and a big smile and two missing teeth. The
                        lack of a scar on
                        his face made him look like a different person—carefree and happy. How could Rachel have known
                        about that
                        picture? </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/6-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“This way, my dear!” Ms. Castellan steered me toward the back of the house.
                        “Oh, I told them
                        you would come back. I knew it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She sat us down at the kitchen table. Stacked on the counter were hundreds—I
                        mean hundreds—of
                        Tupperware boxes with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches inside. The ones on the bottom were
                        green and fuzzy,
                        like they’d been there for a long time. The smell reminded me of my sixth grade locker—and
                        that’s not a good
                        thing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">On top of the oven was a stack of cookie sheets. Each one had a dozen burned
                        cookies on it. In
                        the sink was a mountain of empty plastic Kool-Aid pitchers. A beanbag Medusa sat by the faucet
                        like she was
                        guarding the mess. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Ms. Castellan started humming as she got out peanut butter and jelly and
                        started making a new
                        sandwich. Something was burning in the oven. I got the feeling more cookies were on the way.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Above the sink, taped all around the window, were dozens of little pictures cut
                        from magazines
                        and newspaper ads—pictures of Hermes from the FTD Flowers logo and Quickie Cleaners, pictures of
                        the caduceus
                        from medical ads. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My heart sank. I wanted to get out of that room, but Ms. Castellan kept smiling
                        at me as she
                        made the sandwich, like she was making sure I didn’t bolt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico coughed. “Um, Ms. Castellan?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Mm?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We need to ask you about your son.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, yes! They told me he would never come back. But I knew better.” She patted
                        my cheek
                        affectionately, giving me peanut butter racing stripes. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/6-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“When did you last see him?” Nico asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her eyes lost focus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“He was so young when he left,” she said wistfully. “Third grade. That’s too
                        young to run away!
                        He said he’d be back for lunch. And I waited. He likes peanut butter sandwiches and cookies and
                        Kool-Aid. He’ll
                        be back for lunch very soon….” Then she looked at me and smiled. “Why, Luke, there you are! You
                        look so
                        handsome. You have your father’s eyes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She turned toward the pictures of Hermes above the sink. “Now there’s a good
                        man. Yes, indeed.
                        He comes to visit me, you know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The clock kept ticking in the other room. I wiped the peanut butter off my face
                        and looked at
                        Nico pleadingly, like <i class="calibre5">Can we get out of here now? </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Ma’am,” Nico said. “What, uh…what happened to your eyes?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her gaze seemed fractured—like she was trying to focus on him through a
                        kaleidoscope. “Why,
                        Luke, you know the story. It was right before you were born, wasn’t it? I’d always been special,
                        able to see
                        through the…whatever-they-call-it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The Mist?” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Yes, dear.” She nodded encouragingly. “And they offered me an important job.
                        That’s how
                        special I was!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glanced at Nico, but he looked as confused as I was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What sort of job?” I asked. “What happened?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Ms. Castellan frowned. Her knife hovered over the sandwich bread. “Dear me, it
                        didn’t work out,
                        did it? Your father warned me not to try. He said it was too dangerous. But I had to. It was my
                        destiny! And
                        now…I still can’t get the images out of my head. They make everything seem so fuzzy. Would you
                        like some
                        cookies?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She pulled a tray out of the oven and dumped a dozen lumps of chocolate chip
                        charcoal on the
                        table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Luke was so kind,” Mrs. Castellan murmured. “He left to protect me, you know.
                        He said if he
                        went away, the monsters wouldn’t threaten me. But I told him the monsters are no threat! They
                        sit outside on the
                        sidewalk all day, and they never come in.” She picked up the little stuffed Medusa from the
                        windowsill. “Do
                        they, Mrs. Medusa? No, no threat at all.” She beamed at me. “I’m so glad you came home. I knew
                        you weren’t
                        ashamed of me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shifted in my seat. I imagined being Luke sitting at this table, eight or
                        nine years old, and
                        just beginning to realize that my mother wasn’t all there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Ms. Castellan,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Mom,” she corrected. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Um, yeah. Have you seen Luke since he left home?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Well, of course!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t know if she was imagining that or not. For all I knew, every time the
                        mailman came to
                        the door he was Luke. But Nico sat forward expectantly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“When?” he asked. “When did Luke visit you last?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Well, it was…Oh goodness…” A shadow passed across her face. “The last time, he
                        looked so
                        different. A scar. A terrible scar, and his voice so full of pain…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“His eyes,” I said. “Were they gold?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Gold?” She blinked. “No. How silly. Luke has blue eyes. Beautiful blue eyes!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So Luke really had been here, and this had happened before last summer—before
                        he’d turned into
                        Kronos. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Ms. Castellan?” Nico put his hand on the old woman’s arm. “This is very
                        important. Did he ask
                        you for anything?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She frowned as if trying to remember. “My—my blessing. Isn’t that sweet?” She
                        looked at us
                        uncertainly. “He was going to a river, and he said he needed my blessing. I gave it to him. Of
                        course I did.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico looked at me triumphantly. “Thank you, ma’am. That’s all the information
                        we—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mrs. Castellan gasped. She doubled over, and her cookie tray clattered to the
                        floor. Nico and I
                        jumped to our feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Ms. Castellan?” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“AHHHH.” </i>She straightened. I scrambled away and almost
                        fell over the
                        kitchen table, because her eyes—her eyes were glowing green. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“My child,” </i>she rasped in a much deeper voice. <i
                            class="calibre5">“Must pro</i><i class="calibre5">tect him! Hermes, help! Not my child! Not
                            his fate—no!”
                        </i></p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">She grabbed Nico by the shoulders and began to shake him as if to make him
                        understand. <i class="calibre5">“Not his fate!” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico made a strangled scream and pushed her away. He gripped the hilt of his
                        sword. “Percy, we
                        need to get out—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Suddenly Ms. Castellan collapsed. I lurched forward and caught her before she
                        could hit the
                        edge of the table. I managed to get her into a chair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Ms. C?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She muttered something incomprehensible and shook her head. “Goodness. I…I
                        dropped the cookies.
                        How silly of me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She blinked, and her eyes were back to normal—or at least, what they had been
                        before. The green
                        glow was gone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Are you okay?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Well, of course, dear. I’m fine. Why do you ask?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glanced at Nico, who mouthed the word <i class="calibre5">Leave. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Ms. C., you were telling us something,” I said. “Something about your son.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Was I?” she said dreamily. “Yes, his blue eyes. We were talking about his blue
                        eyes. Such a
                        handsome boy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We have to go,” Nico said urgently. “We’ll tell Luke…uh, we’ll tell him you
                        said hello.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“But you can’t leave!” Ms. Castellan got shakily to her feet, and I backed
                        away. I felt silly
                        being scared of a frail old woman, but the way her voice had changed, the way she’d grabbed
                        Nico…</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Hermes will be here soon,” she promised. “He’ll want to see his boy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Maybe next time,” I said. “Thank you for—” I looked down at the burned cookies
                        scattered on
                        the floor. “Thanks for everything.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">She tried to stop us, to offer us Kool-Aid, but I had to get out of that house.
                        On the front
                        porch, she grabbed my wrist and I almost jumped out of my skin. “Luke, at least be safe. Promise
                        me you’ll be
                        safe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I will…Mom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">That made her smile. She released my wrist, and as she closed the front door I
                        could hear her
                        talking to the candles: “You hear that? He will be safe. I told you he would be!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">As the door shut, Nico and I ran. The little beanbag animals on the sidewalk
                        seemed to grin at
                        us as we passed. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Back at the cliff, Mrs. O’Leary had found a friend. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A cozy campfire crackled in a ring of stones. A girl about eight years old was
                        sitting
                        cross-legged next to Mrs. O’Leary, scratching the hellhound’s ears. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The girl had mousy brown hair and a simple brown dress. She wore a scarf over
                        her head so she
                        looked like a pioneer kid—like the ghost of <i class="calibre5">Little House on the Prairie
                        </i>or something.
                        She poked the fire with a stick, and it seemed to glow more richly red than a normal fire. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/6-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Hello,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My first thought was: monster. When you’re a demigod and you find a sweet
                        little girl alone in
                        the woods—that’s typically a good time to draw your sword and attack. Plus, the encounter with
                        Ms. Castellan had
                        rattled me pretty bad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But Nico bowed to the little girl. “Hello again, Lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She studied me with eyes as red as the firelight. I decided it was safest to
                        bow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Sit, Percy Jackson,” she said. “Would you like some dinner?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">After staring at moldy peanut butter sandwiches and burned cookies, I didn’t
                        have much of an
                        appetite, but the girl waved her hand and a picnic appeared at the edge of the fire. There were
                        plates of roast
                        beef, baked potatoes, buttered carrots, fresh bread, and a whole bunch of other foods I hadn’t
                        had in a long
                        time. My stomach started to rumble. It was the kind of home-cooked meal people are supposed to
                        have but never
                        do. The girl made a five-foot-long dog biscuit appear for Mrs. O’Leary, who happily began
                        tearing it to shreds.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I sat next to Nico. We picked up our food, and I was about to dig in when I
                        thought better of
                        it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I scraped part of my meal into the flames, the way we do at camp. “For the
                        gods,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The little girl smiled. “Thank you. As tender of the flame, I get a share of
                        every sacrifice,
                        you know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I recognize you now,” I said. “The first time I came to camp, you were sitting
                        by the fire, in
                        the middle of the commons area.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You did not stop to talk,” the girl recalled sadly. “Alas, most never do. Nico
                        talked to me.
                        He was the first in many years. Everyone rushes about. No time for visiting family.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You’re Hestia,” I said. “Goddess of the Hearth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Okay…so she looked eight years old. I didn’t ask. I’d learned that gods could
                        look any way they
                        pleased. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“My lady,” Nico asked, “why aren’t you with the other Olympians, fighting
                        Typhon?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’m not much for fighting.” Her red eyes flickered. I realized they weren’t
                        just reflecting
                        the flames. They were filled with flames—but not like Ares’s eyes. Hestia’s eyes were warm and
                        cozy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Besides,” she said, “someone has to keep the home fires burning while the
                        other gods are
                        away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So you’re guarding Mount Olympus?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“‘Guard’ may be too strong a word. But if you ever need a warm place to sit and
                        a home-cooked
                        meal, you are welcome to visit. Now eat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My plate was empty before I knew it. Nico scarfed his down just as fast. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“That was great,” I said. “Thank you, Hestia.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She nodded. “Did you have a good visit with May Castellan?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">For a moment I’d almost forgotten the old lady with her bright eyes and her
                        maniacal smile, the
                        way she’d suddenly seemed possessed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What’s wrong with her, exactly?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“She was born with a gift,” Hestia said. “She could see through the Mist.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Like my mother,” I said. And I was also thinking, <i class="calibre5">Like
                            Rachel</i>. “But
                        the glowing eyes thing—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Some bear the curse of sight better than others,” the goddess said sadly. “For
                        a while, May
                        Castellan had many talents. She attracted the attention of Hermes himself. They had a beautiful
                        baby boy. For a
                        brief time, she was happy. And then she went too far.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I remembered what Mrs. Castellan had said: <i class="calibre5">They offered me
                            an important
                            job…It didn’t work out. </i>I wondered what kind of job left you like that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“One minute she was all happy,” I said. “And then she was freaking out about
                        her son’s fate,
                        like she knew he’d turned into Kronos. What happened to…to divide her like that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The goddess’s face darkened. “That is a story I do not like to tell. But May
                        Castellan saw too
                        much. If you are to understand your enemy Luke, you must understand his family.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I thought about the sad little pictures of Hermes taped above May Castellan’s
                        sink. I wondered
                        if Ms. Castellan had been so crazy when Luke was little. That green-eyed fit could’ve seriously
                        scared a
                        nine-year-old kid. And if Hermes never visited, if he’d left Luke alone with his mom all those
                        years…</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No wonder Luke ran away,” I said. “I mean, it wasn’t right to leave his mom
                        like that, but
                        still—he was just a kid. Hermes shouldn’t have abandoned them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hestia scratched behind Mrs. O’Leary’s ears. The hellhound wagged her tail and
                        accidentally
                        knocked over a tree. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It’s easy to judge others,” Hestia warned. “But will you follow Luke’s path?
                        Seek the same
                        powers?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico set down his plate. “We have no choice, my lady. It’s the only way Percy
                        stands a chance.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Mmm.” Hestia opened her hand and the fire roared. Flames shot thirty feet into
                        the air. Heat
                        slapped me in the face. Then the fire died back down to normal. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/6-9.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">“Not all powers are spectacular.” Hestia looked at me. “Sometimes the hardest
                        power to master
                        is the power of yielding. Do you believe me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Uh-huh,” I said. Anything to keep her from messing with her flame powers
                        again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The goddess smiled. “You are a good hero, Percy Jackson. Not too proud. I like
                        that. But you
                        have much to learn. When Dionysus was made a god, I gave up my throne for him. It was the only
                        way to avoid a
                        civil war among the gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It unbalanced the Council,” I remembered. “Suddenly there were seven guys and
                        five girls.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hestia shrugged. “It was the best solution, not a perfect one. Now I tend the
                        fire. I fade
                        slowly into the background. No one will ever write epic poems about the deeds of Hestia. Most
                        demigods don’t
                        even stop to talk to me. But that is no matter. I keep the peace. I yield when necessary. Can
                        you do this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I don’t know what you mean.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She studied me. “Perhaps not yet. But soon. Will you continue your quest?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Is that why you’re here—to warn me against going?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hestia shook her head. “I am here because when all else fails, when all the
                        other mighty gods
                        have gone off to war, I am all that’s left. Home. Hearth. I am the last Olympian. You must
                        remember me when you
                        face your final decision.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t like the way she said <i class="calibre5">final</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I looked at Nico, then back at Hestia’s warm glowing eyes. “I have to continue,
                        my lady. I have
                        to stop Luke…I mean Kronos.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hestia nodded. “Very well. I cannot be of much assistance, beyond what I have
                        already told you.
                        But since you sacrificed to me, I can return you to your own hearth. I will see you again,
                        Percy, on Olympus.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her tone was ominous, as though our next meeting would not be happy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The goddess waved her hand, and everything faded. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Suddenly I was home. Nico and I were sitting on the couch in my mom’s apartment
                        on the Upper
                        East Side. That was the good news. The bad news was that the rest of the living room was
                        occupied by Mrs.
                        O’Leary. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-5-scenes/6-10.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">I heard a muffled yell from the bedroom. Paul’s voice said, “Who put this wall
                        of fur in the
                        doorway?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy?” my mom called out. “Are you here? Are you all right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’m here!” I shouted back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“WOOF!” </i>Mrs. O’Leary tried to turn in a circle to find
                        my mom, knocking
                        all the pictures off the walls. She’s only met my mom once before (long story), but she loves
                        her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It took a few minutes, but we finally got things worked out. After destroying
                        most of the
                        furniture in the living room and probably making our neighbors really mad, we got my parents out
                        of the bedroom
                        and into the kitchen, where we sat around the kitchen table. Mrs. O’Leary still took up the
                        entire living room,
                        but she’d settled her head in the kitchen doorway so she could see us, which made her happy. My
                        mom tossed her a
                        ten-pound family-size tube of ground beef, which disappeared down her gullet. Paul poured
                        lemonade for the rest
                        of us while I explained about our visit to Connecticut. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So it’s true.” Paul stared at me like he’d never seen me before. He was
                        wearing his white
                        bathrobe, now covered in hellhound fur, and his salt-and-pepper hair was sticking up in every
                        direction. “All
                        the talk about monsters, and being a demigod…it’s really true.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I nodded. Last fall I’d explained to Paul who I was. My mom had backed me up.
                        But until this
                        moment, I don’t think he really believed us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Sorry about Mrs. O’Leary,” I said, “destroying the living room and all.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Paul laughed like he was delighted. “Are you kidding? This is awesome! I mean,
                        when I saw the
                        hoofprints on the Prius, I thought maybe. But this!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He patted Mrs. O’Leary’s snout. The living room shook—<i class="calibre5">BOOM,
                            BOOM,
                            BOOM</i>—which either meant a SWAT team was breaking down the door or Mrs. O’Leary was
                        wagging her tail.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre15">I couldn’t help but smile. Paul was a pretty cool guy, even if he was my
                        English teacher as
                        well as my stepdad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Thanks for not freaking out,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, I’m freaking out,” he promised, his eyes wide. “I just think it’s
                        awesome!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Yeah, well,” I said, “you may not be so excited when you hear what’s
                        happening.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I told Paul and my mom about Typhon, and the gods, and the battle that was sure
                        to come. Then I
                        told them Nico’s plan. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My mom laced her fingers around her lemonade glass. She was wearing her old
                        blue flannel
                        bathrobe, and her hair was tied back. Recently she’d started writing a novel, like she’d wanted
                        to do for years,
                        and I could tell she’d been working on it late into the night, because the circles under her
                        eyes were darker
                        than usual. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Behind her at the kitchen window, silvery moon lace glowed in the flower box.
                        I’d brought the
                        magical plant back from Calypso’s island last summer, and it bloomed like crazy under my
                        mother’s care. The
                        scent always calmed me down, but it also made me sad because it reminded me of lost friends.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My mom took a deep breath, like she was thinking how to tell me no. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy, it’s dangerous,” she said. “Even for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Mom, I know. I could die. Nico explained that. But if we don’t try—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We’ll all die,” Nico said. He hadn’t touched his lemonade. “Ms. Jackson, we
                        don’t stand a
                        chance against an invasion. And there <i class="calibre5">will </i>be an invasion.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“An invasion of New York?” Paul said. “Is that even possible? How could we not
                        see the…the
                        monsters?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He said the word like he still couldn’t believe this was real. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I don’t know,” I admitted. “I don’t see how Kronos could just march into
                        Manhattan, but the
                        Mist is strong. Typhon is trampling across the country right now, and mortals think he’s a storm
                        system.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Ms. Jackson,” Nico said, “Percy needs your blessing. The process <i
                            class="calibre5">has
                        </i>to start that way. I wasn’t sure until we met Luke’s mom, but now I’m positive. This has
                        only been done
                        successfully twice before. Both times, the mother had to give her blessing. She had to be
                        willing to let her son
                        take the risk.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You want me to bless this?” She shook her head. “It’s crazy. Percy, please—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Mom, I can’t do it without you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“And if you survive this…this <i class="calibre5">process</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Then I go to war,” I said. “Me against Kronos. And only one of us will
                        survive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t tell her the whole prophecy—about the soul reaping and the end of my
                        days. She didn’t
                        need to know that I was probably doomed. I could only hope I’d stop Kronos and save the rest of
                        the world before
                        I died. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You’re my son,” she said miserably. “I can’t just…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I could tell I’d have to push her harder if I wanted her to agree, but I didn’t
                        want to. I
                        remembered poor Ms. Castellan in her kitchen, waiting for her son to come home. And I realized
                        how lucky I was.
                        My mom had always been there for me, always tried to make things normal for me, even with the
                        gods and monsters
                        and stuff. She put up with me going off on adventures, but now I was asking her blessing to do
                        something that
                        would probably get me killed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I locked eyes with Paul, and some kind of understanding passed between us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Sally.” He put his hand over my mother’s hands. “I can’t claim to know what
                        you and Percy have
                        been going through all these years. But it sounds to me…it sounds like Percy is doing something
                        noble. I wish I
                        had that much courage.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I got a lump in my throat. I didn’t get compliments like that too much. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My mom stared at her lemonade. She looked like she was trying not to cry. I
                        thought about what
                        Hestia had said, about how hard it was to yield, and I figured maybe my mom was finding that
                        out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy,” she said, “I give you my blessing.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t feel any different. No magic glow lit the kitchen or anything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glanced at Nico. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He looked more anxious than ever, but he nodded. “It’s time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy,” my mom said. “One last thing. If you…if you survive this fight with
                        Kronos, send me a
                        sign.” She rummaged through her purse and handed me her cell phone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Mom,” I said, “you know demigods and phones—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I know,” she said. “But just in case. If you’re not able to call…maybe a sign
                        that I could see
                        from anywhere in Manhattan. To let me know you’re okay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Like Theseus,” Paul suggested. “He was supposed to raise white sails when he
                        came home to
                        Athens.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Except he forgot,” Nico muttered. “And his father jumped off the palace roof
                        in despair. But
                        other than that, it was a great idea.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What about a flag or a flare?” my mom said. “From Olympus—the Empire State
                        Building.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Something blue,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We’d had a running joke for years about blue food. It was my favorite color,
                        and my mom went
                        out of her way to humor me. Every year my birthday cake, my Easter basket, my Christmas candy
                        canes always had
                        to be blue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Yes,” my mom agreed. “I’ll watch for a blue signal. And I’ll try to avoid
                        jumping off palace
                        roofs.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She gave me one last hug. I tried not to feel like I was saying good-bye. I
                        shook hands with
                        Paul. Then Nico and I walked to the kitchen doorway and looked at Mrs. O’Leary. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Sorry, girl,” I said. “Shadow travel time again.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She whimpered and crossed her paws over her snout. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Where now?” I asked Nico. “Los Angeles?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No need,” he said. “There’s a closer entrance to the Underworld.” </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">We emerged in Central Park just north of the Pond. Mrs. O’Leary looked pretty
                        tired as she
                        limped over to a cluster of boulders. She started sniffing around, and I was afraid she might
                        mark her
                        territory, but Nico said, “It’s okay. She just smells the way home.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I frowned. “Through the rocks?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The Underworld has two major entrances,” Nico said. “You know the one in L.A.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Charon’s ferry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico nodded. “Most souls go that way, but there’s a smaller path, harder to
                        find. The Door of
                        Orpheus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The dude with the harp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Dude with the lyre,” Nico corrected. “But yeah, him. He used his music to
                        charm the earth and
                        open a new path into the Underworld. He sang his way right into Hades’s palace and almost got
                        away with his
                        wife’s soul.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I remembered the story. Orpheus wasn’t supposed to look behind him when he was
                        leading his wife
                        back to the world, but of course he did. It was one of those typical “and-so-they-died/the-end”
                        stories that
                        always made us demigods feel warm and fuzzy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So this is the Door of Orpheus.” I tried to be impressed, but it still looked
                        like a pile of
                        rocks to me. “How does it open?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We need music,” Nico said. “How’s your singing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Um, no. Can’t you just, like, tell it to open? You’re the son of Hades and
                        all.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It’s not so easy. We need music.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was pretty sure if I tried to sing, all I would cause was an avalanche. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I have a better idea.” I turned and called, “GROVER!” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">We waited for a long time. Mrs. O’Leary curled up and took a nap. I could hear
                        the crickets in
                        the woods and an owl hooting. Traffic hummed along Central Park West. Horse hooves clopped down
                        a nearby path,
                        maybe a mounted police patrol. I was sure they’d love to find two kids hanging out in the park
                        at one in the
                        morning. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“It’s no good,” Nico said at last. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But I had a feeling. My empathy link was really tingling for the first time in
                        months, which
                        either meant a whole lot of people had suddenly switched on the Nature Channel, or Grover was
                        close. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shut my eyes and concentrated. <i class="calibre5">Grover. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I knew he was somewhere in the park. Why couldn’t I sense his emotions? All I
                        got was a faint
                        hum in the base of my skull. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Grover</i>, I thought more insistently. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Hmm-hmmmm</i>, something said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">An image came into my head. I saw a giant elm tree deep in the woods, well off
                        the main paths.
                        Gnarled roots laced the ground, making a kind of bed. Lying in it with his arms crossed and his
                        eyes closed was
                        a satyr. At first I couldn’t be sure it was Grover. He was covered in twigs and leaves, like
                        he’d been sleeping
                        there a long time. The roots seemed to be shaping themselves around him, slowly pulling him into
                        the earth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Grover</i>, I said. <i class="calibre5">Wake up</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Unnnh—zzzzz. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Dude, you’re covered in dirt. Wake up! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">Sleepy</i>, his mind murmured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">FOOD</i>, I suggested. <i class="calibre5">PANCAKES! </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His eyes shot open. A blur of thoughts filled my head like he was suddenly on
                        fast-forward. The
                        image shattered, and I almost fell over. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What happened?” Nico asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I got through. He’s…yeah. He’s on his way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">A minute later, the tree next to us shivered. Grover fell out of the branches,
                        right on his
                        head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Grover!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“Woof!” </i>Mrs. O’Leary looked up, probably wondering if
                        we were going to
                        play fetch with the satyr. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Blah-haa-haa!” Grover bleated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You okay, man?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, I’m fine.” He rubbed his head. His horns had grown so much they poked an
                        inch above his
                        curly hair. “I was at the other end of the park. The dryads had this great idea of passing me
                        through the trees
                        to get me here. They don’t understand <i class="calibre5">height </i>very well.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He grinned and got to his feet—well, his <i class="calibre5">hooves</i>,
                        actually. Since last
                        summer, Grover had stopped trying to disguise himself as human. He never wore a cap or fake feet
                        anymore. He
                        didn’t even wear jeans, since he had furry goat legs from the waist down. His T-shirt had a
                        picture from that
                        book <i class="calibre5">Where the Wild Things Are</i>. It was covered with dirt and tree sap.
                        His goatee looked
                        fuller, almost manly (or goatly?), and he was as tall as me now. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Good to see you, G-man,” I said. “You remember Nico.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Grover nodded at Nico, then he gave me a big hug. He smelled like fresh-mown
                        lawns. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Perrrrcy!” he bleated. “I missed you! I miss camp. They don’t serve very good
                        enchiladas in
                        the wilderness.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I was worried,” I said. “Where’ve you been the last two months?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The last two—” Grover’s smile faded. “The last <i class="calibre5">two
                            months</i>? What are
                        you talking about?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We haven’t heard from you,” I said. “Juniper’s worried. We sent Iris-messages,
                        but—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Hold on.” He looked up at the stars like he was trying to calculate his
                        position. “What month
                        is this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“August.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The color drained from his face. “That’s impossible. It’s June. I just lay down
                        to take a nap
                        and…” He grabbed my arms. “I remember now! He knocked me out. Percy, we have to stop him!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Whoa,” I said. “Slow down. Tell me what happened.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He took a deep breath. “I was…I was walking in the woods up by Harlem Meer. And
                        I felt this
                        tremble in the ground, like something powerful was near.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You can sense stuff like that?” Nico asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Grover nodded. “Since Pan’s death, I can feel when something is wrong in
                        nature. It’s like my
                        ears and eyes are sharper when I’m in the Wild. Anyway, I started following the scent. This man
                        in a long black
                        coat was walking through the park, and I noticed he didn’t cast a shadow. Middle of a sunny day,
                        and he cast no
                        shadow. He kind of shimmered as he moved.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Like a mirage?” Nico asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Yes,” Grover said. “And whenever he passed humans—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“The humans would pass out,” Nico said. “Curl up and go to sleep.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“That’s right! Then after he was gone, they’d get up and go about their
                        business like nothing
                        happened.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stared at Nico. “You know this guy in black?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Afraid so,” Nico said. “Grover, what happened?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I followed the guy. He kept looking up at the buildings around the park like
                        he was making
                        estimates or something. This lady jogger ran by, and she curled up on the sidewalk and started
                        snoring. The guy
                        in black put his hand on her forehead like he was checking her temperature. Then he kept
                        walking. By this time,
                        I knew he was a monster or something even worse. I followed him into this grove, to the base of
                        a big elm tree.
                        I was about to summon some dryads to help me capture him when he turned and…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Grover swallowed. “Percy, his face. I couldn’t make out his face because it
                        kept shifting. Just
                        looking at him made me sleepy. I said, ‘What are you doing?’ He said, ‘Just having a look
                        around. You should
                        always scout a battlefield before the battle.’ I said something really smart like, ‘This forest
                        is under my
                        protection. You won’t start any battles here!’ And he laughed. He said, ‘You’re lucky I’m saving
                        my energy for
                        the main event, little satyr. I’ll just grant you a short nap. Pleasant dreams.’ And that’s the
                        last thing I
                        remember.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico exhaled. “Grover, you met Morpheus, the God of Dreams. You’re lucky you <i
                            class="calibre5">ever </i>woke up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Two months,” Grover moaned. “He put me to sleep for two months!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I tried to wrap my mind around what this meant. Now it made sense why we hadn’t
                        been able to
                        contact Grover all this time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Why didn’t the nymphs try to wake you?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Grover shrugged. “Most nymphs aren’t good with time. Two months for a
                        tree—that’s nothing. They
                        probably didn’t think anything was wrong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We’ve got to figure out what Morpheus was doing in the park,” I said. “I don’t
                        like this ‘main
                        event’ thing he mentioned.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“He’s working for Kronos,” Nico said. “We know that already. A lot of the minor
                        gods are. This
                        just proves there’s going to be an invasion. Percy, we have to get on with our plan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Wait,” Grover said. “What plan?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We told him, and Grover started tugging at his leg fur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You’re not serious,” he said. “Not the Underworld again.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’m not asking you to come, man,” I promised. “I know you just woke up. But we
                        need some music
                        to open the door. Can you do it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Grover took out his reed pipes. “I guess I could try. I know a few Nirvana
                        tunes that can split
                        rocks. But, Percy, are you sure you want to do this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Please, man,” I said. “It would mean a lot. For old times’ sake?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He whimpered. “As I recall, in the old times we almost died a lot. But okay,
                        here goes
                        nothing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He put his pipes to his lips and played a shrill, lively tune. The boulders
                        trembled. A few
                        more stanzas, and they cracked open, revealing a triangular crevice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I peered inside. Steps led down into the darkness. The air smelled of mildew
                        and death. It
                        brought back bad memories of my trip through the Labyrinth last year, but this tunnel felt even
                        more dangerous.
                        It led straight to the land of Hades, and that was almost always a one-way trip. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I turned to Grover. “Thanks…I think.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Perrrrcy, is Kronos really going to invade?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I wish I could tell you better, but yeah. He will.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I thought Grover might chew up his reed pipes in anxiety, but he straightened
                        up and brushed
                        off his T-shirt. I couldn’t help thinking how different he looked from fat old Leneus. “I’ve got
                        to rally the
                        nature spirits, then. Maybe we can help. I’ll see if we can find this Morpheus!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Better tell Juniper you’re okay, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">His eyes widened. “Juniper! Oh, she’s going to kill me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He started to run off, then scrambled back and gave me another hug. “Be careful
                        down there!
                        Come back alive!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Once he was gone, Nico and I roused Mrs. O’Leary from her nap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">When she smelled the tunnel, she got excited and led the way down the steps. It
                        was a pretty
                        tight fit. I hoped she wouldn’t get stuck. I couldn’t imagine how much Drano we’d need to
                        un-stick a hellhound
                        wedged halfway down a tunnel to the Underworld. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Ready?” Nico asked me. “It’ll be fine. Don’t worry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He sounded like he was trying to convince himself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glanced up at the stars, wondering if I would ever see them again. Then we
                        plunged into
                        darkness. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">The stairs went on forever—narrow, steep, and slippery. It was completely dark
                        except for the
                        light of my sword. I tried to go slow, but Mrs. O’Leary had other ideas. She bounded ahead,
                        barking happily. The
                        sound echoed through the tunnel like cannon shots, and I figured we would not be catching
                        anybody by surprise
                        once we reached the bottom. Nico lagged behind, which I thought was strange. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You okay?” I asked him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Fine.” What was that expression on his face…doubt? “Just keep moving,” he
                        said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t have much choice. I followed Mrs. O’Leary into the depths. After
                        another hour, I
                        started to hear the roar of a river. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We emerged at the base of a cliff, on a plain of black volcanic sand. To our
                        right, the River
                        Styx gushed from the rocks and roared off in a cascade of rapids. To our left, far away in the
                        gloom, fires
                        burned on the ramparts of Erebus, the great black walls of Hades’s kingdom. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I shuddered. I’d first been here when I was twelve, and only Annabeth and
                        Grover’s company had
                        given me the courage to keep going. Nico wasn’t going to be quite as helpful with the “courage”
                        thing. He looked
                        pale and worried himself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Only Mrs. O’Leary acted happy. She ran along the beach, picked up a random
                        human leg bone, and
                        romped back toward me. She dropped the bone at my feet and waited for me to throw it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Um, maybe later, girl.” I stared at the dark waters, trying to get up my
                        nerve. “So, Nico…how
                        do we do this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We have to go inside the gates first,” he said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“But the river’s right here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I have to get something,” he said. “It’s the only way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He marched off without waiting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I frowned. Nico hadn’t mentioned anything about going inside the gates. But now
                        that we were
                        here, I didn’t know what else to do. Reluctantly, I followed him down the beach toward the big
                        black gates. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Lines of the dead stood outside waiting to get in. It must’ve been a heavy day
                        for funerals,
                        because even the EZ-DEATH line was backed up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“Woof!” </i>Mrs. O’Leary said. Before I could stop her she
                        bounded toward
                        the security checkpoint. Cerberus, the guard dog of Hades, appeared out of the gloom—a
                        three-headed rottweiler
                        so big he made Mrs. O’Leary look like a toy poodle. Cerberus was half transparent, so he’s
                        really hard to see
                        until he’s close enough to kill you, but he acted like he didn’t care about us. He was too busy
                        saying hello to
                        Mrs. O’Leary. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Mrs. O’Leary, no!” I shouted at her. “Don’t sniff…Oh, man.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico smiled. Then he looked at me and his expression turned all serious again,
                        like he’d
                        remembered something unpleasant. “Come on. They won’t give us any trouble in the line. You’re
                        with me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I didn’t like it, but we slipped through the security ghouls and into the
                        Fields of Asphodel. I
                        had to whistle for Mrs. O’Leary three times before she left Cerberus alone and ran after us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We hiked over black fields of grass dotted with black poplar trees. If I really
                        died in a few
                        days like the prophecy said, I might end up here forever, but I tried not to think about that.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico trudged ahead, bringing us closer and closer to the palace of Hades. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Hey,” I said, “we’re inside the gates already. Where are we—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mrs. O’Leary growled. A shadow appeared overhead— something dark, cold, and
                        stinking of death.
                        It swooped down and landed in the top of a poplar tree. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Unfortunately, I recognized her. She had a shriveled face, a horrible blue knit
                        hat, and a
                        crumpled velvet dress. Leathery bat wings sprang from her back. Her feet had sharp talons, and
                        in her
                        brass-clawed hands she held a flaming whip and a paisley handbag. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Mrs. Dodds,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She bared her fangs. “Welcome back, honey.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Her two sisters—the other Furies—swooped down and settled next to her in the
                        branches of the
                        poplar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You know Alecto?” Nico asked me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“If you mean the hag in the middle, yeah,” I said. “She was my math teacher.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico nodded, like this didn’t surprise him. He looked up at the Furies and took
                        a deep breath.
                        “I’ve done what my father asked. Take us to the palace.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I tensed. “Wait a second, Nico. What do you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’m afraid this is my new lead, Percy. My father promised me information about
                        my family, but
                        he wants to see you before we try the river. I’m sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You <i class="calibre5">tricked </i>me?” I was so mad I couldn’t think. I
                        lunged at him, but
                        the Furies were fast. Two of them swooped down and plucked me up by the arms. My sword fell out
                        of my hand, and
                        before I knew it, I was dangling sixty feet in the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, don’t struggle, honey,” my old math teacher cackled in my ear. “I’d hate
                        to drop you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Mrs. O’Leary barked angrily and jumped, trying to reach me, but we were too
                        high. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Tell Mrs. O’Leary to behave,” Nico warned. He was hovering near me in the
                        clutches of the
                        third Fury. “I don’t want her to get hurt, Percy. My father is waiting. He just wants to talk.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wanted to tell Mrs. O’Leary to attack Nico, but it wouldn’t have done any
                        good, and Nico was
                        right about one thing: my dog could get hurt if she tried to pick a fight with the Furies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I gritted my teeth. “Mrs. O’Leary, down! It’s okay, girl.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She whimpered and turned in circles, looking up at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“All right, traitor,” I growled at Nico. “You’ve got your prize. Take me to the
                        stupid palace.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre15">Alecto dropped me like a sack of turnips in the middle of the palace garden.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">It was beautiful in a creepy way. Skeletal white trees grew from marble basins.
                        Flower beds
                        overflowed with golden plants and gemstones. A pair of thrones, one bone and one silver, sat on
                        the balcony with
                        a view of the Fields of Asphodel. It would’ve been a nice place to spend a Saturday morning
                        except for the
                        sulfurous smell and the cries of tortured souls in the distance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Skeletal warriors guarded the only exit. They wore tattered U.S. Army desert
                        combat fatigues
                        and carried M16s. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The third Fury deposited Nico next to me. Then all three of them settled on the
                        top of the
                        skeletal throne. I resisted the urge to strangle Nico. They’d only stop me. I’d have to wait for
                        my revenge.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I stared at the empty thrones, waiting for something to happen. Then the air
                        shimmered. Three
                        figures appeared— Hades and Persephone on their thrones, and an older woman standing between
                        them. They seemed
                        to be in the middle of an argument. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“—told you he was a bum!” the older woman said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Mother!” Persephone replied. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“We have visitors!” Hades barked. “Please!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hades, one of my least favorite gods, smoothed his black robes, which were
                        filled with the
                        terrified faces of the damned. He had pale skin and the intense eyes of a madman. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Percy Jackson,” he said with satisfaction. “At last.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Queen Persephone studied me curiously. I’d seen her once before in the winter,
                        but now in the
                        summer she looked like a totally different goddess. She had lustrous black hair and warm brown
                        eyes. Her dress
                        shimmered with colors. Flower patterns in the fabric changed and bloomed—roses, tulips,
                        honeysuckle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The woman standing between them was obviously Persephone’s mother. She had the
                        same hair and
                        eyes, but looked older and sterner. Her dress was golden, the color of a wheat field. Her hair
                        was woven with
                        dried grasses so it reminded me of a wicker basket. I figured if somebody lit a match next to
                        her, she’d be in
                        serious trouble. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Hmmph,” the older woman said. “Demigods. Just what we need.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Next to me, Nico knelt. I wished I had my sword so I could cut his stupid head
                        off.
                        Unfortunately, Riptide was still out in the fields somewhere. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Father,” Nico said. “I have done as you asked.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Took you long enough,” Hades grumbled. “Your sister would’ve done a better
                        job.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico lowered his head. If I hadn’t been so mad at the little creep, I might’ve
                        felt sorry for
                        him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I glared up at the god of the dead. “What do you want, Hades?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“To talk, of course.” The god twisted his mouth in a cruel smile. “Didn’t Nico
                        tell you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“So this whole quest was a lie. Nico brought me down here to get me killed.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, no,” Hades said. “I’m afraid Nico was quite sincere about wanting to help
                        you. The boy is
                        as honest as he is dense. I simply convinced him to take a small detour and bring you here
                        first.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Father,” Nico said, “you promised that Percy would not be harmed. You said if
                        I brought him,
                        you would tell me about my past—about my mother.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Queen Persephone sighed dramatically. “Can we <i class="calibre5">please
                        </i>not talk about <i class="calibre5">that woman </i>in my presence?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’m sorry, my dove,” Hades said. “I had to promise the boy something.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The older lady harrumphed. “I warned you, daughter. This scoundrel Hades is no
                        good. You
                        could’ve married the god of doctors or the god of lawyers, but <i class="calibre5">noooo</i>.
                        You had to eat the
                        pomegranate.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Mother—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“And get stuck in the Underworld!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Mother, please—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“And here it is August, and do you come home like you’re supposed to? Do you
                        ever think about
                        your poor lonely mother?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“DEMETER!” Hades shouted. “That is enough. You are a guest in my house.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Oh, a house is it?” she said. “You call this dump a house? Make my daughter
                        live in this dark,
                        damp—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I told you,” Hades said, grinding his teeth, “there’s a <i
                            class="calibre5">war </i>in the
                        world above. You and Persephone are better off here with me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Excuse me,” I broke in. “But if you’re going to kill me, could you just get on
                        with it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">All three gods looked at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Well, this one has an attitude,” Demeter observed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Indeed,” Hades agreed. “I’d love to kill him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Father!” Nico said. “You promised!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Husband, we talked about this,” Persephone chided. “You can’t go around
                        incinerating every
                        hero. Besides, he’s brave. I like that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hades rolled his eyes. “You liked that Orpheus fellow too. Look how well that
                        turned out. Let
                        me kill him, just a little bit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Father, you promised!” Nico said. “You said you only wanted to talk to him.
                        You said if I
                        brought him, you’d explain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hades glowered, smoothing the folds of his robes. “And so I shall. Your
                        mother—what can I tell
                        you? She was a wonderful woman.” He glanced uncomfortably at Persephone. “Forgive me, my dear. I
                        mean for a
                        mortal, of course. Her name was Maria di Angelo. She was from Venice, but her father was a
                        diplomat in
                        Washington, D.C. That’s where I met her. When you and your sister were young, it was a bad time
                        to be children
                        of Hades. World War II was brewing. A few of my, ah, <i class="calibre5">other </i>children were
                        leading the
                        losing side. I thought it best to put you two out of harm’s way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“That’s why you hid us in the Lotus Casino?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hades shrugged. “You didn’t age. You didn’t realize time was passing. I waited
                        for the right
                        time to bring you out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“But what happened to our mother? Why don’t I remember her?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Not important,” Hades snapped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“<i class="calibre5">What? </i>Of course it’s important. And you had other
                        children—why were we
                        the only ones who were sent away? And who was the lawyer who got us out?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hades grit his teeth. “You would do well to listen more and talk less, boy. As
                        for the lawyer…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hades snapped his fingers. On top of his throne, the Fury Alecto began to
                        change until she was
                        a middle-aged man in a pinstriped suit with a briefcase. She—he—looked strange crouching at
                        Hades’s shoulder.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You!” Nico said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The Fury cackled. “I do lawyers and teachers very well!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Nico was trembling. “But why did you free us from the casino?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You know why,” Hades said. “This idiot son of Poseidon cannot be allowed to be
                        the child of
                        the prophecy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I plucked a ruby off the nearest plant and threw it at Hades. It sank
                        harmlessly into his robe.
                        “You should be helping Olympus!” I said. “All the other gods are fighting Typhon, and you’re
                        just sitting here—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Waiting things out,” Hades finished. “Yes, that’s correct. When’s the last
                        time Olympus ever
                        helped me, half-blood? When’s the last time a child of <i class="calibre5">mine </i>was ever
                        welcomed as a hero?
                        Bah! Why should I rush out and help them? I’ll stay here with my forces intact.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“And when Kronos comes after you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Let him try. He’ll be weakened. And my son here, Nico—” Hades looked at him
                        with distaste.
                        “Well, he’s not much now, I’ll grant you. It would’ve been better if Bianca had lived. But give
                        him four more
                        years of training. We can hold out that long, surely. Nico will turn sixteen, as the prophecy
                        says, and then <i class="calibre5">he </i>will make the decision that will save the world. And I
                        will be king of the gods.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“You’re crazy,” I said. “Kronos will crush you, right after he finishes
                        pulverizing Olympus.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hades spread his hands. “Well, you’ll get a chance to find out, half-blood.
                        Because you’ll be
                        waiting out this war in my dungeons.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No!” Nico said. “Father, that wasn’t our agreement. And you haven’t told me
                        everything!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I’ve told you all you need to know,” Hades said. “As for our agreement, I
                        spoke with Jackson.
                        I did not harm him. You got your information. If you had wanted a better deal, you should’ve
                        made me swear on
                        the Styx. Now go to your room!” He waved his hand and Nico vanished. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“That boy needs to eat more,” Demeter grumbled. “He’s too skinny. He needs more
                        cereal.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Persephone rolled her eyes. “Mother, enough with the cereal. My lord Hades, are
                        you sure we
                        can’t let this little hero go? He’s awfully brave.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“No, my dear. I’ve spared his life. That’s enough.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I was sure she was going to stand up for me. The brave, beautiful Persephone
                        was going to get
                        me out of this. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She shrugged indifferently. “Fine. What’s for breakfast? I’m starving.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Cereal,” Demeter said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><i class="calibre5">“Mother!” </i>The two women disappeared in a swirl of
                        flowers and wheat.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Don’t feel too bad, Percy Jackson,” Hades said. “My ghosts keep me well
                        informed of Kronos’s
                        plans. I can assure you that you had no chance to stop him in time. By tonight, it will be too
                        late for your
                        precious Mount Olympus. The trap will be sprung.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“What trap?” I demanded. “If you know about it, do something! At least let me
                        tell the other
                        gods!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Hades smiled. “You are spirited. I’ll give you credit for that. Have fun in my
                        dungeon. We’ll
                        check on you again in—oh, fifty or sixty years.” </p>
