                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">My nightmare started like this. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was standing on a deserted street in some little beach town. It was the
                        middle of the night.
                        A storm was blowing. Wind and rain ripped at the palm trees along the sidewalk. Pink and yellow
                        stucco buildings
                        lined the street, their windows boarded up. A block away, past a line of hibiscus bushes, the
                        ocean churned.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Florida</i>, I thought. Though I wasn’t sure how I knew
                        that. I’d never
                        been to Florida. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I heard hooves clattering against the pavement. I turned and saw my friend
                        Grover running
                        for his life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Yeah, I said <i class="calibre5">hooves</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover is a satyr. From the waist up, he looks like a typical gangly teenager
                        with a peach-fuzz
                        goatee and a bad case of acne. He walks with a strange limp, but unless you happen to catch him
                        without his
                        pants on (which I don’t recommend), you’d never know there was anything unhuman about him. Baggy
                        jeans and fake
                        feet hide the fact that he’s got furry hindquarters and hooves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover had been my best friend in sixth grade. He’d gone on this adventure with
                        me and a girl
                        named Annabeth to save the world, but I hadn’t seen him since last July, when he set off alone
                        on a dangerous
                        quest—a quest no satyr had ever returned from. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Anyway, in my dream, Grover was hauling goat tail, holding his human shoes in
                        his hands the way
                        he does when he needs to move fast. He clopped past the little tourist shops and surfboard
                        rental places. The
                        wind bent the palm trees almost to the ground. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover was terrified of something behind him. He must’ve just come from the
                        beach. Wet sand was
                        caked in his fur. He’d escaped from somewhere. He was trying to get away from... something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A bone-rattling growl cut through the storm. Behind Grover, at the far end of
                        the block, a
                        shadowy figure loomed. It swatted aside a street lamp, which burst in a shower of sparks. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/1-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover stumbled, whimpering in fear. He muttered to himself, <i
                            class="calibre5">Have to get
                            away. Have to warn them! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t see what was chasing him, but I could hear it muttering and cursing.
                        The ground
                        shook as it got closer. Grover dashed around a street corner and faltered. He’d run into a
                        dead-end courtyard
                        full of shops. No time to back up. The nearest door had been blown open by the storm. The sign
                        above the
                        darkened display window read: <small class="calibre4">ST. AUGUSTINE BRIDAL BOUTIQUE</small>.</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover dashed inside. He dove behind a rack of wedding dresses. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The monster’s shadow passed in front of the shop. I could smell the thing—a
                        sickening
                        combination of wet sheep wool and rotten meat and that weird sour body odor only monsters have,
                        like a skunk
                        that’s been living off Mexican food. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover trembled behind the wedding dresses. The monster’s shadow passed on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Silence except for the rain. Grover took a deep breath. Maybe the thing was
                        gone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then lightning flashed. The entire front of the store exploded, and a monstrous
                        voice bellowed:
                        “MIIIIINE!” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I sat bolt upright, shivering in my bed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was no storm. No monster. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Morning sunlight filtered through my bedroom window. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought I saw a shadow flicker across the glass—a humanlike shape. But then
                        there was a knock
                        on my bedroom door—my mom called: “Percy, you’re going to be late”—and the shadow at the window
                        disappeared.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It must’ve been my imagination. A fifth-story window with a rickety old fire
                        escape... there
                        couldn’t have been anyone out there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come on, dear,” my mother called again. “Last day of school. You should be
                        excited! You’ve
                        almost made it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Coming,” I managed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I felt under my pillow. My fingers closed reassuringly around the ballpoint pen
                        I always slept
                        with. I brought it out, studied the Ancient Greek writing engraved on the side: <i
                            class="calibre5">Anaklusmos</i>. Riptide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought about uncapping it, but something held me back. I hadn’t used Riptide
                        for so long....
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Besides, my mom had made me promise not to use deadly weapons in the apartment
                        after I’d swung
                        a javelin the wrong way and taken out her china cabinet. I put Anaklusmos on my nightstand and
                        dragged myself
                        out of bed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I got dressed as quickly as I could. I tried not to think about my nightmare or
                        monsters or the
                        shadow at my window. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Have to get away. Have to warn them!</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">What had Grover meant? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I made a three-fingered claw over my heart and pushed outward—an ancient
                        gesture Grover had
                        once taught me for warding off evil. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The dream couldn’t have been real. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Last day of school. My mom was right, I should have been excited. For the first
                        time in my
                        life, I’d almost made it an entire year without getting expelled. No weird accidents. No fights
                        in the
                        classroom. No teachers turning into monsters and trying to kill me with poisoned cafeteria food
                        or exploding
                        homework. Tomorrow, I’d be on my way to my favorite place in the world—Camp Half-Blood. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/1-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Only one more day to go. Surely even I couldn’t mess that up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As usual, I didn’t have a clue how wrong I was. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">My mom made blue waffles and blue eggs for breakfast. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She’s funny that way, celebrating special occasions with blue food. I think
                        it’s her way of
                        saying anything is possible. Percy can pass seventh grade. Waffles can be blue. Little miracles
                        like that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I ate at the kitchen table while my mom washed dishes. She was dressed in her
                        work uniform—a
                        starry blue skirt and a red-and-white striped blouse she wore to sell candy at Sweet on America.
                        Her long brown
                        hair was pulled back in a ponytail. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The waffles tasted great, but I guess I wasn’t digging in like I usually did.
                        My mom looked
                        over and frowned. “Percy, are you all right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah... fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But she could always tell when something was bothering me. She dried her hands
                        and sat down
                        across from me. “School, or...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She didn’t need to finish. I knew what she was asking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I think Grover’s in trouble,” I said, and I told her about my dream. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pursed her lips. We didn’t talk much about the <i class="calibre5">other
                        </i>part of my
                        life. We tried to live as normally as possible, but my mom knew all about Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I wouldn’t be too worried, dear,” she said. “Grover is a big satyr now. If
                        there were a
                        problem, I’m sure we would’ve heard from... from camp....” Her shoulders tensed as she said the
                        word
                        <i class="calibre5">camp</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What is it?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nothing,” she said. “I’ll tell you what. This afternoon we’ll celebrate the
                        end of school.
                        I’ll take you and Tyson to Rockefeller Center—to that skateboard shop you like.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Oh, man, that was tempting. We were always struggling with money. Between my
                        mom’s night
                        classes and my private school tuition, we could never afford to do special stuff like shop for a
                        skateboard. But
                        something in her voice bothered me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait a minute,” I said. “I thought we were packing me up for camp tonight.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She twisted her dishrag. “Ah, dear, about that... I got a message from Chiron
                        last
                        night.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My heart sank. Chiron was the activities director at Camp Half-Blood. He
                        wouldn’t contact us
                        unless something serious was going on. “What did he say?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He thinks... it might not be safe for you to come to camp just yet. We might
                        have
                        to postpone.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Postpone</i><i class="calibre5">? </i>Mom, how could it
                        not be <i class="calibre5">safe</i>? I’m a half-blood! It’s like the only safe place on earth
                        for me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Usually, dear. But with the problems they’re having—”</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">What </i>problems?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy... I’m very, very sorry. I was hoping to talk to you about it this
                        afternoon. I can’t
                        explain it all now. I’m not even sure Chiron can. Everything happened so suddenly.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">My mind was reeling. How could I <i class="calibre5">not </i>go to camp? I
                        wanted to ask a
                        million questions, but just then the kitchen clock chimed the half-hour. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mom looked almost relieved. “Seven-thirty, dear. You should go. Tyson will
                        be waiting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, we’ll talk this afternoon. Go on to school.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That was the last thing I wanted to do, but my mom had this fragile look in her
                        eyes—a kind of
                        warning, like if I pushed her too hard she’d start to cry. Besides, she was right about my
                        friend Tyson. I had
                        to meet him at the subway station on time or he’d get upset. He was scared of traveling
                        underground alone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I gathered up my stuff, but I stopped in the doorway. “Mom, this problem at
                        camp. Does it... could
                        it have anything to do with my dream about Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She wouldn’t meet my eyes. “We’ll talk this afternoon, dear. I’ll explain... as
                        much as I can.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Reluctantly, I told her good-bye. I jogged downstairs to catch the Number Two
                        train. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know it at the time, but my mom and I would never get to have our
                        afternoon talk. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In fact, I wouldn’t be seeing home for a long, long time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As I stepped outside, I glanced at the brownstone building across the street.
                        Just for a second
                        I saw a dark shape in the morning sunlight—a human silhouette against the brick wall, a shadow
                        that belonged to
                        no one. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then it rippled and vanished. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">My day started normal. Or as normal as it ever gets at Meriwether College Prep.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">See, it’s this “progressive” school in downtown Manhattan, which means we sit
                        on beanbag chairs
                        instead of at desks, and we don’t get grades, and the teachers wear jeans and rock concert
                        T-shirts to work.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That’s all cool with me. I mean, I’m ADHD and dyslexic, like most half-bloods,
                        so I’d never
                        done that great in regular schools even before they kicked me out. The only bad thing about
                        Meriwether was that
                        the teachers always looked on the bright side of things, and the kids weren’t always... well,
                        bright. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Take my first class today: English. The whole middle school had read this book
                        called <i class="calibre5">Lord of the Flies</i>, where all these kids get marooned on an island
                        and go psycho. So for
                        our final exam, our teachers sent us into the break yard to spend an hour with no adult
                        supervision to see what
                        would happen. What happened was a massive wedgie contest between the seventh and eighth graders,
                        two pebble
                        fights, and a full-tackle basketball game. The school bully, Matt Sloan, led most of those
                        activities. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Sloan wasn’t big or strong, but he acted like he was. He had eyes like a pit
                        bull, and shaggy
                        black hair, and he always dressed in expensive but sloppy clothes, like he wanted everybody to
                        see how little he
                        cared about his family’s money. One of his front teeth was chipped from the time he’d taken his
                        daddy’s Porsche
                        for a joyride and run into a <small class="calibre4">PLEASE SLOW DOWN FOR CHILDREN</small> sign.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Anyway, Sloan was giving everybody wedgies until he made the mistake of trying
                        it on my friend
                        Tyson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson was the only homeless kid at Meriwether College Prep. As near as my mom
                        and I could
                        figure, he’d been abandoned by his parents when he was very young, probably because he was
                        so... different. He was
                        six-foot-three and built like the Abominable Snowman, but he cried a lot and was scared of just
                        about
                        everything, including his own reflection. His face was kind of misshapen and brutal-looking. I
                        couldn’t tell you
                        what color his eyes were, because I could never make myself look higher than his crooked teeth.
                        His voice was
                        deep, but he talked funny, like a much younger kid—I guess because he’d never gone to school
                        before coming to
                        Meriwether. He wore tattered jeans, grimy size-twenty sneakers, and a plaid flannel shirt with
                        holes in it. He
                        smelled like a New York City alleyway, because that’s where he lived, in a cardboard
                        refrigerator box off 72nd
                        Street. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Meriwether Prep had adopted him as a community service project so all the
                        students could feel
                        good about themselves. Unfortunately, most of them couldn’t stand Tyson. Once they discovered he
                        was a big
                        softie, despite his massive strength and his scary looks, they made themselves feel good by
                        picking on him. I
                        was pretty much his only friend, which meant he was <i class="calibre5">my </i>only friend. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mom had complained to the school a million times that they weren’t doing
                        enough to help him.
                        She’d called social services, but nothing ever seemed to happen. The social workers claimed
                        Tyson didn’t exist.
                        They swore up and down that they’d visited the alley we described and couldn’t find him, though
                        how you miss a
                        giant kid living in a refrigerator box, I don’t know. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Anyway, Matt Sloan snuck up behind him and tried to give him a wedgie, and
                        Tyson panicked. He
                        swatted Sloan away a little too hard. Sloan flew fifteen feet and got tangled in the little
                        kids’ tire swing.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“You freak!” Sloan yelled. “Why don’t you go back to your cardboard box!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson started sobbing. He sat down on the jungle gym so hard he bent the bar,
                        and buried his
                        head in his hands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Take it back, Sloan!” I shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Sloan just sneered at me. “Why do you even bother, Jackson? You might have <i
                            class="calibre5">friends </i>if you weren’t always sticking up for that freak.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I balled my fists. I hoped my face wasn’t as red as it felt. “He’s <i
                            class="calibre5">not
                        </i>a freak. He’s just...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to think of the right thing to say, but Sloan wasn’t listening. He and
                        his big ugly
                        friends were too busy laughing. I wondered if it were my imagination, or if Sloan had more goons
                        hanging around
                        him than usual. I was used to seeing him with two or three, but today he had like, half a dozen
                        more, and I was
                        pretty sure I’d never seen them before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Just wait till PE, Jackson,” Sloan called. “You are <i class="calibre5">so
                        </i>dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When first period ended, our English teacher, Mr. de Milo, came outside to
                        inspect the carnage.
                        He pronounced that we’d understood <i class="calibre5">Lord of the Flies </i>perfectly. We all
                        passed his
                        course, and we should never, never grow up to be violent people. Matt Sloan nodded earnestly,
                        then gave me a
                        chip-toothed grin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I had to promise to buy Tyson an extra peanut butter sandwich at lunch to get
                        him to stop
                        sobbing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I... I am a freak?” he asked me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” I promised, gritting my teeth. “Matt Sloan is the freak.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson sniffled. “You are a good friend. Miss you next year if... if I can’t...”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His voice trembled. I realized he didn’t know if he’d be invited back next year
                        for the
                        community service project. I wondered if the headmaster had even bothered talking to him about
                        it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t worry, big guy,” I managed. “Everything’s going to be fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Tyson gave me such a grateful look I felt like a big liar. How could I promise
                        a kid like him
                        that <i class="calibre5">anything </i>would be fine? </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Our next exam was science. Mrs. Tesla told us that we had to mix chemicals
                        until we succeeded
                        in making something explode. Tyson was my lab partner. His hands were way too big for the tiny
                        vials we were
                        supposed to use. He accidentally knocked a tray of chemicals off the counter and made an orange
                        mushroom cloud
                        in the trash can. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">After Mrs. Tesla evacuated the lab and called the hazardous waste removal
                        squad, she praised
                        Tyson and me for being natural chemists. We were the first ones who’d ever aced her exam in
                        under thirty
                        seconds. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was glad the morning went fast, because it kept me from thinking too much
                        about my problems.
                        I couldn’t stand the idea that something might be wrong at camp. Even worse, I couldn’t shake
                        the memory of my
                        bad dream. I had a terrible feeling that Grover was in danger. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In social studies, while we were drawing latitude/longitude maps, I opened my
                        notebook and
                        stared at the photo inside—my friend Annabeth on vacation in Washington, D.C. She was wearing
                        jeans and a denim
                        jacket over her orange Camp Half-Blood T-shirt. Her blond hair was pulled back in a bandanna.
                        She was standing
                        in front of the Lincoln Memorial with her arms crossed, looking extremely pleased with herself,
                        like she’d
                        personally designed the place. See, Annabeth wants to be an architect when she grows up, so
                        she’s always
                        visiting famous monuments and stuff. She’s weird that way. She’d e-mailed me the picture after
                        spring break, and
                        every once in a while I’d look at it just to remind myself she was real and Camp Half-Blood
                        hadn’t just been my
                        imagination. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/2-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I wished Annabeth were here. She’d know what to make of my dream. I’d never
                        admit it to her,
                        but she was smarter than me, even if she was annoying sometimes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was about to close my notebook when Matt Sloan reached over and ripped the
                        photo out of the
                        rings. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” I protested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Sloan checked out the picture and his eyes got wide. “No way, Jackson. Who is
                        that? She is <i class="calibre5">not </i>your—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Give it back!” My ears felt hot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Sloan handed the photo to his ugly buddies, who snickered and started ripping
                        it up to make
                        spit wads. They were new kids who must’ve been visiting, because they were all wearing those
                        stupid <small class="calibre4">HI! MY NAME IS</small><i class="calibre5">: </i>tags from the
                        admissions office. They
                        must’ve had a weird sense of humor, too, because they’d all filled in strange names like: <small
                            class="calibre4">MARROW SUCKER, SKULL EATER,</small> and <small class="calibre4">JOE
                            BOB</small>. No human
                        beings had names like that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“These guys are moving here next year,” Sloan bragged, like that was supposed
                        to scare me. “I
                        bet they can <i class="calibre5">pay </i>the tuition, too, unlike your retard friend.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He’s <i class="calibre5">not </i>retarded.” I had to try really, really hard
                        not to punch
                        Sloan in the face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re such a loser, Jackson. Good thing I’m gonna put you out of your misery
                        next period.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His huge buddies chewed up my photo. I wanted to pulverize them, but I was
                        under strict orders
                        from Chiron never to take my anger out on regular mortals, no matter how obnoxious they were. I
                        had to save my
                        fighting for monsters. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Still, part of me thought, if Sloan only knew who I really was... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The bell rang. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As Tyson and I were leaving class, a girl’s voice whispered, “Percy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked around the locker area, but nobody was paying me any attention. Like
                        any girl at
                        Meriwether would ever be caught dead calling my name. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I had time to consider whether or not I’d been imagining things, a crowd
                        of kids rushed
                        for the gym, carrying Tyson and me along with them. It was time for PE. Our coach had promised
                        us a free-for-all
                        dodgeball game, and Matt Sloan had promised to kill me. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The gym uniform at Meriwether is sky blue shorts and tie-dyed T-shirts.
                        Fortunately, we did
                        most of our athletic stuff inside, so we didn’t have to jog through Tribeca looking like a bunch
                        of boot-camp
                        hippie children. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I changed as quickly as I could in the locker room because I didn’t want to
                        deal with Sloan. I
                        was about to leave when Tyson called, “Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He hadn’t changed yet. He was standing by the weight room door, clutching his
                        gym clothes.
                        “Will you... uh...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh. Yeah.” I tried not to sound aggravated about it. “Yeah, sure, man.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson ducked inside the weight room. I stood guard outside the door while he
                        changed. I felt
                        kind of awkward doing this, but he asked me to most days. I think it’s because he’s completely
                        hairy and he’s
                        got weird scars on his back that I’ve never had the courage to ask him about. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Anyway, I’d learned the hard way that if people teased Tyson while he was
                        dressing out, he’d
                        get upset and start ripping the doors off lockers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When we got into the gym, Coach Nunley was sitting at his little desk reading
                        <i class="calibre5">Sports Illustrated</i>. Nunley was about a million years old, with bifocals
                        and no teeth
                        and a greasy wave of gray hair. He reminded me of the Oracle at Camp Half-Blood—which was a
                        shriveled-up
                        mummy—except Coach Nunley moved a lot less and he never billowed green smoke. Well, at least not
                        that I’d
                        observed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Matt Sloan said, “Coach, can I be captain?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Eh?” Coach Nunley looked up from his magazine. “Yeah,” he mumbled. “Mm-hmm.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Sloan grinned and took charge of the picking. He made me the other team’s
                        captain, but it
                        didn’t matter who I picked, because all the jocks and the popular kids moved over to Sloan’s
                        side. So did the
                        big group of visitors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">On my side I had Tyson, Corey Bailer the computer geek, Raj Mandali the
                        calculus whiz, and a
                        half dozen other kids who always got harassed by Sloan and his gang. Normally I would’ve been
                        okay with just
                        Tyson—he was worth half a team all by himself—but the visitors on Sloan’s team were almost as
                        tall and
                        strong-looking as Tyson, and there were six of them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Matt Sloan spilled a cage full of balls in the middle of the gym. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Scared,” Tyson mumbled. “Smell funny.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at him. “What smells funny?” Because I didn’t figure he was talking
                        about himself.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Them.” Tyson pointed at Sloan’s new friends. “Smell funny.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The visitors were cracking their knuckles, eyeing us like it was slaughter
                        time. I couldn’t
                        help wondering where they were from. Someplace where they fed kids raw meat and beat them with
                        sticks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Sloan blew the coach’s whistle and the game began. Sloan’s team ran for the
                        center line. On my
                        side, Raj Mandali yelled something in Urdu, probably “I have to go potty!” and ran for the exit.
                        Corey Bailer
                        tried to crawl behind the wall mat and hide. The rest of my team did their best to cower in fear
                        and not look
                        like targets. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson,” I said. “Let’s g—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A ball slammed into my gut. I sat down hard in the middle of the gym floor. The
                        other team
                        exploded in laughter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My eyesight was fuzzy. I felt like I’d just gotten the Heimlich maneuver from a
                        gorilla. I
                        couldn’t believe anybody could throw that hard. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/2-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson yelled, “Percy, duck!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I rolled as another dodgeball whistled past my ear at the speed of sound. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Whooom!</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It hit the wall mat, and Corey Bailer yelped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” I yelled at Sloan’s team. “You could kill somebody!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The visitor named Joe Bob grinned at me evilly. Somehow, he looked a lot bigger
                        now... even taller
                        than Tyson. His biceps bulged beneath his T-shirt. “I hope so, Perseus Jackson! I hope so!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The way he said my name sent a chill down my back. Nobody called me Perseus
                        except those who
                        knew my true identity. Friends... and enemies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">What had Tyson said? <i class="calibre5">They smell funny</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Monsters. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">All around Matt Sloan, the visitors were growing in size. They were no longer
                        kids. They were
                        eight-foot-tall giants with wild eyes, pointy teeth, and hairy arms tattooed with snakes and
                        hula women and
                        Valentine hearts. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/2-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Matt Sloan dropped his ball. “Whoa! You’re not from Detroit! Who...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The other kids on his team started screaming and backing toward the exit, but
                        the giant named
                        Marrow Sucker threw a ball with deadly accuracy. It streaked past Raj Mandali just as he was
                        about to leave and
                        hit the door, slamming it shut like magic. Raj and some of the other kids banged on it
                        desperately but it
                        wouldn’t budge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Let them go!” I yelled at the giants. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The one called Joe Bob growled at me. He had a tattoo on his biceps that said:
                        <i class="calibre5">JB luvs Babycakes</i>. “And lose our tasty morsels? No, Son of the Sea God.
                        We
                        Laistrygonians aren’t just playing for your death. We want lunch!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He waved his hand and a new batch of dodgeballs appeared on the center line—but
                        these balls
                        weren’t made of red rubber. They were bronze, the size of cannon balls, perforated like wiffle
                        balls with fire
                        bubbling out the holes. They must’ve been searing hot, but the giants picked them up with their
                        bare hands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Coach!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nunley looked up sleepily, but if he saw anything abnormal about the dodgeball
                        game, he didn’t
                        let on. That’s the problem with mortals. A magical force called the Mist obscures the true
                        appearance of
                        monsters and gods from their vision, so mortals tend to see only what they can understand. Maybe
                        the coach saw a
                        few eighth graders pounding the younger kids like usual. Maybe the other kids saw Matt Sloan’s
                        thugs getting
                        ready to toss Molotov cocktails around. (It wouldn’t have been the first time.) At any rate, I
                        was pretty sure
                        nobody else realized we were dealing with genuine man-eating bloodthirsty monsters. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah. Mm-hmm,” Coach muttered. “Play nice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And he went back to his magazine. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The giant named Skull Eater threw his ball. I dove aside as the fiery bronze
                        comet sailed past
                        my shoulder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Corey!” I screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson pulled him out from behind the exercise mat just as the ball exploded
                        against it,
                        blasting the mat to smoking shreds. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Run!” I told my teammates. “The other exit!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They ran for the locker room, but with another wave of Joe Bob’s hand, that
                        door also slammed
                        shut. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No one leaves unless you’re out!” Joe Bob roared. “And you’re not out until we
                        eat you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He launched his own fireball. My teammates scattered as it blasted a crater in
                        the gym floor.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I reached for Riptide, which I always kept in my pocket, but then I realized I
                        was wearing gym
                        shorts. I <i class="calibre5">had </i>no pockets. Riptide was tucked in my jeans inside my gym
                        locker. And the
                        locker room door was sealed. I was completely defenseless. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Another fireball came streaking toward me. Tyson pushed me out of the way, but
                        the explosion
                        still blew me head over heels. I found myself sprawled on the gym floor, dazed from smoke, my
                        tie-dyed T-shirt
                        peppered with sizzling holes. Just across the center line, two hungry giants were glaring down
                        at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Flesh!” they bellowed. “Hero flesh for lunch!” They both took aim. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy needs help!” Tyson yelled, and he jumped in front of me just as they
                        threw their balls.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” I screamed, but it was too late. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Both balls slammed into him... but no... he’d caught them. Somehow Tyson, who
                        was so
                        clumsy he
                        knocked over lab equipment and broke playground structures on a regular basis, had caught two
                        fiery metal balls
                        speeding toward him at a zillion miles an hour. He sent them hurtling back toward their
                        surprised owners, who
                        screamed, “BAAAAAD!” as the bronze spheres exploded against their chests. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The giants disintegrated in twin columns of flame—a sure sign they were
                        monsters, all right.
                        Monsters don’t die. They just dissipate into smoke and dust, which saves heroes a lot of trouble
                        cleaning up
                        after a fight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“My brothers!” Joe Bob the Cannibal wailed. He flexed his muscles and his <i
                            class="calibre5">Babycakes </i>tattoo rippled. “You will pay for their destruction!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” I said. “Look out!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Another comet hurtled toward us. Tyson just had time to swat it aside. It flew
                        straight over
                        Coach Nunley’s head and landed in the bleachers with a huge <small
                            class="calibre4">KA-BOOM!</small> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Kids were running around screaming, trying to avoid the sizzling craters in the
                        floor. Others
                        were banging on the door, calling for help. Sloan himself stood petrified in the middle of the
                        court, watching
                        in disbelief as balls of death flew around him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Coach Nunley still wasn’t seeing anything. He tapped his hearing aid like the
                        explosions were
                        giving him interference, but he kept his eyes on his magazine. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Surely the whole school could hear the noise. The headmaster, the police,
                        somebody would come
                        help us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Victory will be ours!” roared Joe Bob the Cannibal. “We will feast on your
                        bones!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to tell him he was taking the dodgeball game way too seriously, but
                        before I could, he
                        hefted another ball. The other three giants followed his lead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I knew we were dead. Tyson couldn’t deflect all those balls at once. His hands
                        <i class="calibre5">had </i>to be seriously burned from blocking the first volley. Without my
                        sword...
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I had a crazy idea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I ran toward the locker room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Move!” I told my teammates. “Away from the door.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Explosions behind me. Tyson had batted two of the balls back toward their
                        owners and blasted
                        them to ashes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That left two giants still standing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A third ball hurtled straight at me. I forced myself to wait—one Mississippi,
                        two
                        Mississippi—then dove aside as the fiery sphere demolished the locker room door. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Now, I figured that the built-up gas in most boys’ locker rooms was enough to
                        cause an
                        explosion, so I wasn’t surprised when the flaming dodgeball ignited a huge <i
                            class="calibre5">WHOOOOOOOM!</i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The wall blew apart. Locker doors, socks, athletic supporters, and other
                        various nasty personal
                        belongings rained all over the gym. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/2-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned just in time to see Tyson punch Skull Eater in the face. The giant
                        crumpled. But the
                        last giant, Joe Bob, had wisely held on to his own ball, waiting for an opportunity. He threw
                        just as Tyson was
                        turning to face him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The ball caught Tyson square in the chest. He slid the length of the court and
                        slammed into the
                        back wall, which cracked and partially crumbled on top of him, making a hole right onto Church
                        Street. I didn’t
                        see how Tyson could still be alive, but he only looked dazed. The bronze ball was smoking at his
                        feet. Tyson
                        tried to pick it up, but he fell back, stunned, into a pile of cinder blocks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well!” Joe Bob gloated. “I’m the last one standing! I’ll have enough meat to
                        bring Babycakes a
                        doggie bag!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He picked up another ball and aimed it at Tyson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stop!” I yelled. “It’s me you want!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The giant grinned. “You wish to die first, young hero?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I had to do something. Riptide had to be around here somewhere. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I spotted my jeans in a smoking heap of clothes right by the giant’s feet.
                        If I could only
                        get there.... I knew it was hopeless, but I charged. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The giant laughed. “My lunch approaches.” He raised his arm to throw. I braced
                        myself to die.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Suddenly the giant’s body went rigid. His expression changed from gloating to
                        surprise. Right
                        where his belly button should’ve been, his T-shirt ripped open and he grew something like a
                        horn—no, not a
                        horn—the glowing tip of a blade. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The ball dropped out of his hand. The monster stared down at the knife that had
                        just run him
                        through from behind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He muttered, “Ow,” and burst into a cloud of green flame, which I figured was
                        going to make
                        Babycakes pretty upset. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Standing in the smoke was my friend Annabeth. Her face was grimy and scratched.
                        She had a
                        ragged backpack slung over her shoulder, her baseball cap tucked in her pocket, a bronze knife
                        in her hand, and
                        a wild look in her storm-gray eyes, like she’d just been chased a thousand miles by ghosts. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/2-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Matt Sloan, who’d been standing there dumbfounded the whole time, finally came
                        to his senses.
                        He blinked at Annabeth, as if he dimly recognized her from my notebook picture. “That’s the
                        girl... That’s the
                        girl—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth punched him in the nose and knocked him flat. “And <i
                            class="calibre5">you</i>,” she
                        told him, “lay off my friend.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The gym was in flames. Kids were still running around screaming. I heard sirens
                        wailing and a
                        garbled voice over the intercom. Through the glass windows of the exit doors, I could see the
                        headmaster, Mr.
                        Bonsai, wrestling with the lock, a crowd of teachers piling up behind him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth...” I stammered. “How did you... how long have you...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Pretty much all morning.” She sheathed her bronze knife. “I’ve been trying to
                        find a good time
                        to talk to you, but you were never alone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The shadow I saw this morning—that was—” My face felt hot. “Oh my gods, you
                        were looking in my
                        bedroom window?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There’s no time to explain!” she snapped, though she looked a little red-faced
                        herself. “I
                        just didn’t want to—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There!” a woman screamed. The doors burst open and the adults came pouring in.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Meet me outside,” Annabeth told me. “And him.” She pointed to Tyson, who was
                        still sitting
                        dazed against the wall. Annabeth gave him a look of distaste that I didn’t quite understand.
                        “You’d better bring
                        him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">What?</i>” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No time!” she said. “Hurry!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She put on her Yankees baseball cap, which was a magic gift from her mom, and
                        instantly
                        vanished. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That left me standing alone in the middle of the burning gymnasium when the
                        headmaster came
                        charging in with half the faculty and a couple of police officers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy Jackson?” Mr. Bonsai said. “What... how...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Over by the broken wall, Tyson groaned and stood up from the pile of cinder
                        blocks. “Head
                        hurts.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Matt Sloan was coming around, too. He focused on me with a look of terror.
                        “Percy did it, Mr.
                        Bonsai! He set the whole building on fire. Coach Nunley will tell you! He saw it all!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Coach Nunley had been dutifully reading his magazine, but just my luck—he chose
                        that moment to
                        look up when Sloan said his name. “Eh? Yeah. Mm-hmm.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The other adults turned toward me. I knew they would never believe me, even if
                        I could tell
                        them the truth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I grabbed Riptide out of my ruined jeans, told Tyson, “Come on!” and jumped
                        through the gaping
                        hole in the side of the building. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">Annabeth was waiting for us in an alley down Church Street. She pulled Tyson
                        and me off the
                        sidewalk just as a fire truck screamed past, heading for Meriwether Prep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Where’d you find <i class="calibre5">him</i>?” she demanded, pointing at
                        Tyson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Now, under different circumstances, I would’ve been really happy to see her.
                        We’d made our
                        peace last summer, despite the fact that her mom was Athena and didn’t get along with my dad.
                        I’d missed
                        Annabeth probably more than I wanted to admit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But I’d just been attacked by cannibal giants, Tyson had saved my life three or
                        four times, and
                        all Annabeth could do was glare at him like <i class="calibre5">he </i>was the problem. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He’s my friend,” I told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Is he homeless?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What does that have to do with anything? He can hear you, you know. Why don’t
                        you ask him?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked surprised. “He can talk?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I talk,” Tyson admitted. “You are pretty.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah! Gross!” Annabeth stepped away from him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t believe she was being so rude. I examined Tyson’s hands, which I was
                        sure must’ve
                        been badly scorched by the flaming dodge balls, but they looked fine—grimy and scarred, with
                        dirty fingernails
                        the size of potato chips—but they always looked like that. “Tyson,” I said in disbelief. “Your
                        hands aren’t even
                        burned.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/3-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Of course not,” Annabeth muttered. “I’m surprised the Laistrygonians had the
                        guts to attack
                        you with him around.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson seemed fascinated by Annabeth’s blond hair. He tried to touch it, but she
                        smacked his
                        hand away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth,” I said, “what are you talking about? Laistry-what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Laistrygonians. The monsters in the gym. They’re a race of giant cannibals who
                        live in the far
                        north. Odysseus ran into them once, but I’ve never seen them as far south as New York before.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Laistry—I can’t even say that. What would you call them in English?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She thought about it for a moment. “Canadians,” she decided. “Now come on, we
                        have to get out
                        of here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The police’ll be after me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s the least of our problems,” she said. “Have you been having the
                        dreams?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The dreams... about Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her face turned pale. “Grover? No, what about Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I told her my dream. “Why? What were <i class="calibre5">you </i>dreaming
                        about?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her eyes looked stormy, like her mind was racing a million miles an hour. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Camp,” she said at last. “Big trouble at camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“My mom was saying the same thing! But what <i class="calibre5">kind </i>of
                        trouble?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t know exactly. Something’s wrong. We have to get there right away.
                        Monsters have been
                        chasing me all the way from Virginia, trying to stop me. Have you had a lot of attacks?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I shook my head. “None all year... until today.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“None? But how...” Her eyes drifted to Tyson. “Oh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean, ‘oh’?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson raised his hand like he was still in class. “Canadians in the gym called
                        Percy
                        something... Son of the Sea God?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and I exchanged looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know how I could explain, but I figured Tyson deserved the truth after
                        almost getting
                        killed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Big guy,” I said, “you ever hear those old stories about the Greek gods? Like
                        Zeus, Poseidon,
                        Athena—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes,” Tyson said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well... those gods are still alive. They kind of follow Western Civilization
                        around, living in
                        the strongest countries, so like now they’re in the U.S. And sometimes they have kids with
                        mortals. Kids called
                        half-bloods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes,” Tyson said, like he was still waiting for me to get to the point. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uh, well, Annabeth and I are half-bloods,” I said. “We’re
                        like... heroes-in-training. And
                        whenever monsters pick up our scent, they attack us. That’s what those giants were in the gym.
                        Monsters.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at him. He didn’t seem surprised or confused by what I was telling
                        him, which
                        surprised and confused me. “So... you believe me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson nodded. “But you are... Son of the Sea God?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I admitted. “My dad is Poseidon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson frowned. <i class="calibre5">Now </i>he looked confused. “But then...”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A siren wailed. A police car raced past our alley. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We don’t have time for this,” Annabeth said. “We’ll talk in the taxi.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A taxi all the way to camp?” I said. “You know how much money—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Trust me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hesitated. “What about Tyson?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I imagined escorting my giant friend into Camp Half-Blood. If he freaked out on
                        a regular
                        playground with regular bullies, how would he act at a training camp for demigods? On the other
                        hand, the cops
                        would be looking for us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We can’t just leave him,” I decided. “He’ll be in trouble, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah.” Annabeth looked grim. “We definitely need to take him. Now come on.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t like the way she said that, as if Tyson were a big disease we needed
                        to get to the
                        hospital, but I followed her down the alley. Together the three of us sneaked through the side
                        streets of
                        downtown while a huge column of smoke billowed up behind us from my school gymnasium. </p>


                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">“Here.” Annabeth stopped us on the corner of Thomas and Trimble. She fished
                        around in her
                        backpack. “I hope I have one left.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked even worse than I’d realized at first. Her chin was cut. Twigs and
                        grass were
                        tangled in her ponytail, as if she’d slept several nights in the open. The slashes on the hems
                        of her jeans
                        looked suspiciously like claw marks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What are you looking for?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">All around us, sirens wailed. I figured it wouldn’t be long before more cops
                        cruised by,
                        looking for juvenile delinquent gym-bombers. No doubt Matt Sloan had given them a statement by
                        now. He’d
                        probably twisted the story around so that Tyson and I were the bloodthirsty cannibals. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Found one. Thank the gods.” Annabeth pulled out a gold coin that I recognized
                        as a drachma,
                        the currency of Mount Olympus. It had Zeus’s likeness stamped on one side and the Empire State
                        Building on the
                        other. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth,” I said, “New York taxi drivers won’t take that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Stêthi</i>,” she shouted in Ancient Greek. “<i
                            class="calibre5">Ô hárma
                            diabolês!</i>” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As usual, the moment she spoke in the language of Olympus, I somehow understood
                        it. She’d said:
                        <i class="calibre5">Stop, Chariot of Damnation! </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That didn’t exactly make me feel real excited about whatever her plan was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She threw her coin into the street, but instead of clattering on the asphalt,
                        the drachma sank
                        right through and disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">For a moment, nothing happened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then, just where the coin had fallen, the asphalt darkened. It melted into a
                        rectangular pool
                        about the size of a parking space—bubbling red liquid like blood. Then a car erupted from the
                        ooze. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was a taxi, all right, but unlike every other taxi in New York, it wasn’t
                        yellow. It was
                        smoky gray. I mean it looked like it was <i class="calibre5">woven </i>out of smoke, like you
                        could walk right
                        through it. There were words printed on the door—something like <small class="calibre4">GYAR
                            SSIRES</small>—but
                        my dyslexia made it hard for me to decipher what it said. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/3-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The passenger window rolled down, and an old woman stuck her head out. She had
                        a mop of
                        grizzled hair covering her eyes, and she spoke in a weird mumbling way, like she’d just had a
                        shot of Novocain.
                        “Passage? Passage?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Three to Camp Half-Blood,” Annabeth said. She opened the cab’s back door and
                        waved at me to
                        get in, like this was all completely normal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ach!” the old woman screeched. “We don’t take <i class="calibre5">his
                        </i>kind!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pointed a bony finger at Tyson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">What was it? Pick-on-Big-and-Ugly-Kids Day? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Extra pay,” Annabeth promised. “Three more drachma on arrival.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Done!” the woman screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Reluctantly I got in the cab. Tyson squeezed in the middle. Annabeth crawled in
                        last. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The interior was also smoky gray, but it felt solid enough. The seat was
                        cracked and lumpy—no
                        different than most taxis. There was no Plexiglas screen separating us from the old lady
                        driving... Wait a minute.
                        There wasn’t just one old lady. There were three, all crammed in the front seat, each with
                        stringy hair covering
                        her eyes, bony hands, and a charcoal-colored sackcloth dress. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The one driving said, “Long Island! Out-of-metro fare bonus! Ha!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She floored the accelerator, and my head slammed against the backrest. A
                        prerecorded voice came
                        on over the speaker: <i class="calibre5">Hi, this is Ganymede, cup-bearer to Zeus, and when I’m
                            out buying wine
                            for the Lord of the Skies, I always buckle up! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked down and found a large black chain instead of a seat belt. I decided I
                        wasn’t that
                        desperate... yet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The cab sped around the corner of West Broadway, and the gray lady sitting in
                        the middle
                        screeched, “Look out! Go left!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, if you’d give me the eye, Tempest, I could <i class="calibre5">see
                        </i>that!” the driver
                        complained. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Wait a minute. <i class="calibre5">Give her the eye? </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t have time to ask questions because the driver swerved to avoid an
                        oncoming delivery
                        truck, ran over the curb with a jaw-rattling <i class="calibre5">thump</i>, and flew into the
                        next block. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wasp!” the third lady said to the driver. “Give me the girl’s coin! I want to
                        bite it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You bit it last time, Anger!” said the driver, whose name must’ve been Wasp.
                        “It’s my turn!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Is not!” yelled the one called Anger. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The middle one, Tempest, screamed, “Red light!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Brake!” yelled Anger. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Instead, Wasp floored the accelerator and rode up on the curb, screeching
                        around another
                        corner, and knocking over a newspaper box. She left my stomach somewhere back on Broome Street.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Excuse me,” I said. “But... can you see?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” screamed Wasp from behind the wheel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” screamed Tempest from the middle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Of course!” screamed Anger by the shotgun window. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at Annabeth. “They’re blind?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not completely,” Annabeth said. “They have an eye.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“One eye?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Each?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No. One eye total.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Next to me, Tyson groaned and grabbed the seat. “Not feeling so good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, man,” I said, because I’d seen Tyson get carsick on school field trips and
                        it was <i class="calibre5">not </i>something you wanted to be within fifty feet of. “Hang in
                        there, big guy. Anybody
                        got a garbage bag or something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The three gray ladies were too busy squabbling to pay me any attention. I
                        looked over at
                        Annabeth, who was hanging on for dear life, and I gave her a <i
                            class="calibre5">why-did-you-do-this-to-me
                        </i>look. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey,” she said, “Gray Sisters Taxi is the fastest way to camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then why didn’t you take it from Virginia?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s outside their service area,” she said, like that should be obvious.
                        “They only serve
                        Greater New York and surrounding communities.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ve had famous people in this cab!” Anger exclaimed. “Jason! You remember
                        him?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t remind me!” Wasp wailed. “And we didn’t have a cab back then, you old
                        bat. That was
                        three thousand years ago!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Give me the tooth!” Anger tried to grab at Wasp’s mouth, but Wasp swatted her
                        hand away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Only if Tempest gives me the eye!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Tempest screeched. “You had it yesterday!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But I’m driving, you old hag!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Excuses! Turn! That was your turn!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Wasp swerved hard onto Delancey Street, squishing me between Tyson and the
                        door. She punched
                        the gas and we shot up the Williamsburg Bridge at seventy miles an hour. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The three sisters were fighting for real now, slapping each other as Anger
                        tried to grab at
                        Wasp’s face and Wasp tried to grab at Tempest’s. With their hair flying and their mouths open,
                        screaming at each
                        other, I realized that none of the sisters had any teeth except for Wasp, who had one mossy
                        yellow incisor.
                        Instead of eyes, they just had closed, sunken eyelids, except for Anger, who had one bloodshot
                        green eye that
                        stared at everything hungrily, as if it couldn’t get enough of anything it saw. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/3-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally Anger, who had the advantage of sight, managed to yank the tooth out of
                        her sister
                        Wasp’s mouth. This made Wasp so mad she swerved toward the edge of the Williamsburg Bridge,
                        yelling, “’Ivit
                        back! ’Ivit back!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson groaned and clutched his stomach. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uh, if anybody’s interested,” I said, “we’re going to die!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t worry,” Annabeth told me, sounding pretty worried. “The Gray Sisters
                        know what they’re
                        doing. They’re really very wise.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">This coming from the daughter of Athena, but I wasn’t exactly reassured. We
                        were skimming along
                        the edge of a bridge a hundred and thirty feet above the East River. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, wise!” Anger grinned in the rearview mirror, showing off her newly
                        acquired tooth. “We
                        know things!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Every street in Manhattan!” Wasp bragged, still hitting her sister. “The
                        capital of Nepal!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The location you seek!” Tempest added. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Immediately her sisters pummeled her from either side, screaming, “Be quiet! Be
                        quiet! He
                        didn’t even ask yet!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” I said. “What location? I’m not seeking any—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nothing!” Tempest said. “You’re right, boy. It’s nothing!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tell me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” they all screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The last time we told, it was horrible!” Tempest said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Eye tossed in a lake!” Anger agreed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Years to find it again!” Wasp moaned. “And speaking of that—give it back!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” yelled Anger. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Eye!” Wasp yelled. “Gimme!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She whacked her sister Anger on the back. There was a sickening <i
                            class="calibre5">pop </i>and
                        something flew out of Anger’s face. Anger fumbled for it, trying to catch it, but she only
                        managed to bat it
                        with the back of her hand. The slimy green orb sailed over her shoulder, into the backseat, and
                        straight into my
                        lap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I jumped so hard, my head hit the ceiling and the eyeball rolled away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I can’t see!” all three sisters yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Give me the eye!” Wasp wailed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Give her the eye!” Annabeth screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t have it!” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There, by your foot,” Annabeth said. “Don’t step on it! Get it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m not picking that up!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The taxi slammed against the guardrail and skidded along with a horrible
                        grinding noise. The
                        whole car shuddered, billowing gray smoke as if it were about to dissolve from the strain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Going to be sick!” Tyson warned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth,” I yelled, “let Tyson use your backpack!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Are you crazy? Get the eye!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Wasp yanked the wheel, and the taxi swerved away from the rail. We hurtled down
                        the bridge
                        toward Brooklyn, going faster than any human taxi. The Gray Sisters screeched and pummeled each
                        other and cried
                        out for their eye. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">At last I steeled my nerves. I ripped off a chunk of my tie-dyed T-shirt, which
                        was already
                        falling apart from all the burn marks, and used it to pick the eyeball off the floor. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/3-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nice boy!” Anger cried, as if she somehow knew I had her missing peeper. “Give
                        it back!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not until you explain,” I told her. “What were you talking about, the location
                        I seek?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No time!” Tempest cried. “Accelerating!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked out the window. Sure enough, trees and cars and whole neighborhoods
                        were now zipping
                        by in a gray blur. We were already out of Brooklyn, heading through the middle of Long Island.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” Annabeth warned, “they can’t find our destination without the eye.
                        We’ll just keep
                        accelerating until we break into a million pieces.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“First they have to tell me,” I said. “Or I’ll open the window and throw the
                        eye into oncoming
                        traffic.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” the Gray Sisters wailed. “Too dangerous!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m rolling down the window.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait!” the Gray Sisters screamed. “30, 31, 75, 12!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They belted it out like a quarterback calling a play. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” I said. “That makes no sense!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“30, 31, 75, 12!” Anger wailed. “That’s all we can tell you. Now give us the
                        eye! Almost to
                        camp!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were off the highway now, zipping through the countryside of northern Long
                        Island. I could
                        see Half-Blood Hill ahead of us, with its giant pine tree at the crest—Thalia’s tree, which
                        contained the life
                        force of a fallen hero. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Annabeth said more urgently. “Give them the eye <i
                            class="calibre5">now</i>!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I decided not to argue. I threw the eye into Wasp’s lap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The old lady snatched it up, pushed it into her eye socket like somebody
                        putting in a contact
                        lens, and blinked. “Whoa!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She slammed on the brakes. The taxi spun four or five times in a cloud of smoke
                        and squealed to
                        a halt in the middle of the farm road at the base of Half-Blood Hill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson let loose a huge belch. “Better now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right,” I told the Gray Sisters. “Now tell me what those numbers mean.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No time!” Annabeth opened her door. “We have to get out <i
                            class="calibre5">now</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was about to ask why, when I looked up at Half-Blood Hill and understood.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">At the crest of the hill was a group of campers. And they were under attack.

                        ladies, it’s bulls.
                        Last summer, I fought the Minotaur on top of Half-Blood Hill. This time what I saw up there was
                        even worse: two
                        bulls. And not just regular bulls—bronze ones the size of elephants. And even <i
                            class="calibre5">that
                        </i>wasn’t bad enough. Naturally they had to breathe fire, too. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">As soon as we exited the taxi, the Gray Sisters peeled out, heading back to New
                        York, where
                        life was safer. They didn’t even wait for their extra three-drachma payment. They just left us
                        on the side of
                        the road, Annabeth with nothing but her backpack and knife, Tyson and me still in our burned-up
                        tie-dyed gym
                        clothes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, man,” said Annabeth, looking at the battle raging on the hill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">What worried me most weren’t the bulls themselves. Or the ten heroes in full
                        battle armor who
                        were getting their bronze-plated booties whooped. What worried me was that the bulls were
                        ranging all over the
                        hill, even around the back side of the pine tree. That shouldn’t have been possible. The camp’s
                        magic boundaries
                        didn’t allow monsters to cross past Thalia’s tree. But the metal bulls were doing it anyway.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">One of the heroes shouted, “Border patrol, to me!” A girl’s voice—gruff and
                        familiar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Border patrol? I thought. The camp didn’t <i class="calibre5">have </i>a border
                        patrol. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s Clarisse,” Annabeth said. “Come on, we have to help her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Normally, rushing to Clarisse’s aid would not have been high on my “to do”
                        list. She was one of
                        the biggest bullies at camp. The first time we’d met she tried to introduce my head to a toilet.
                        She was also a
                        daughter of Ares, and I’d had a very serious disagreement with her father last summer, so now
                        the god of war and
                        all his children basically hated my guts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Still, she <i class="calibre5">was </i>in trouble. Her fellow warriors were
                        scattering, running
                        in panic as the bulls charged. The grass was burning in huge swathes around the pine tree. One
                        hero screamed and
                        waved his arms as he ran in circles, the horsehair plume on his helmet blazing like a fiery
                        Mohawk. Clarisse’s
                        own armor was charred. She was fighting with a broken spear shaft, the other end embedded
                        uselessly in the metal
                        joint of one bull’s shoulder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I uncapped my ballpoint pen. It shimmered, growing longer and heavier until I
                        held the bronze
                        sword Anaklusmos in my hands. “Tyson, stay here. I don’t want you taking any more chances.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Annabeth said. “We need him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at her. “He’s mortal. He got lucky with the dodge balls but he can’t—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, do you know what those are up there? The Colchis bulls, made by
                        Hephaestus himself. We
                        can’t fight them without Medea’s Sunscreen SPF 50,000. We’ll get burned to a crisp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Medea’s <i class="calibre5">what</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth rummaged through her backpack and cursed. “I had a jar of tropical
                        coconut scent
                        sitting on my night-stand at home. Why didn’t I bring it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I’d learned a long time ago not to question Annabeth too much. It just made me
                        more confused.
                        “Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I’m <i class="calibre5">not </i>going to let
                        Tyson get
                        fried.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson, stay back.” I raised my sword. “I’m going in.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson tried to protest, but I was already running up the hill toward Clarisse,
                        who was yelling
                        at her patrol, trying to get them into phalanx formation. It was a good idea. The few who were
                        listening lined
                        up shoulder-to-shoulder, locking their shields to form an ox-hide–and-bronze wall, their spears
                        bristling over
                        the top like porcupine quills. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Unfortunately, Clarisse could only muster six campers. The other four were
                        still running around
                        with their helmets on fire. Annabeth ran toward them, trying to help. She taunted one of the
                        bulls into chasing
                        her, then turned invisible, completely confusing the monster. The other bull charged Clarisse’s
                        line. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was halfway up the hill—not close enough to help. Clarisse hadn’t even seen
                        me yet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The bull moved deadly fast for something so big. Its metal hide gleamed in the
                        sun. It had
                        fist-sized rubies for eyes, and horns of polished silver. When it opened its hinged mouth, a
                        column of white-hot
                        flame blasted out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hold the line!” Clarisse ordered her warriors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Whatever else you could say about Clarisse, she was brave. She was a big girl
                        with cruel eyes
                        like her father’s. She looked like she was born to wear Greek battle armor, but I didn’t see how
                        even she could
                        stand against that bull’s charge. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/4-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Unfortunately, at that moment, the other bull lost interest in finding
                        Annabeth. It turned,
                        wheeling around behind Clarisse on her unprotected side. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Behind you!” I yelled. “Look out!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I shouldn’t have said anything, because all I did was startle her. Bull Number
                        One crashed into
                        her shield, and the phalanx broke. Clarisse went flying backward and landed in a smoldering
                        patch of grass. The
                        bull charged past her, but not before blasting the other heroes with its fiery breath. Their
                        shields melted
                        right off their arms. They dropped their weapons and ran as Bull Number Two closed in on
                        Clarisse for the kill.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I lunged forward and grabbed Clarisse by the straps of her armor. I dragged her
                        out of the way
                        just as Bull Number Two freight-trained past. I gave it a good swipe with Riptide and cut a huge
                        gash in its
                        flank, but the monster just creaked and groaned and kept on going. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It hadn’t touched me, but I could feel the heat of its metal skin. Its body
                        temperature
                        could’ve microwaved a frozen burrito. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Let me go!” Clarisse pummeled my hand. “Percy, curse you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I dropped her in a heap next to the pine tree and turned to face the bulls. We
                        were on the
                        inside slope of the hill now, the valley of Camp Half-Blood directly below us—the cabins, the
                        training
                        facilities, the Big House—all of it at risk if these bulls got past us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth shouted orders to the other heroes, telling them to spread out and
                        keep the bulls
                        distracted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bull Number One ran a wide arc, making its way back toward me. As it passed the
                        middle of the
                        hill, where the invisible boundary line should’ve kept it out, it slowed down a little, as if it
                        were struggling
                        against a strong wind; but then it broke through and kept coming. Bull Number Two turned to face
                        me, fire
                        sputtering from the gash I’d cut in its side. I couldn’t tell if it felt any pain, but its ruby
                        eyes seemed to
                        glare at me like I’d just made things personal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t fight both bulls at the same time. I’d have to take down Bull Number
                        Two first, cut
                        its head off before Bull Number One charged back into range. My arms already felt tired. I
                        realized how long it
                        had been since I’d worked out with Riptide, how out of practice I was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I lunged but Bull Number Two blew flames at me. I rolled aside as the air
                        turned to pure heat.
                        All the oxygen was sucked out of my lungs. My foot caught on something—a tree root, maybe—and
                        pain shot up my
                        ankle. Still, I managed to slash with my sword and lop off part of the monster’s snout. It
                        galloped away, wild
                        and disoriented. But before I could feel too good about that, I tried to stand, and my left leg
                        buckled
                        underneath me. My ankle was sprained, maybe broken. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bull Number One charged straight toward me. No way could I crawl out of its
                        path. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth shouted: “Tyson, help him!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Somewhere near, toward the crest of the hill, Tyson wailed,
                        “Can’t—get—through!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I, Annabeth Chase, give you permission to enter camp!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thunder shook the hillside. Suddenly Tyson was there, barreling toward me,
                        yelling: “Percy
                        needs help!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before I could tell him no, he dove between me and the bull just as it
                        unleashed a nuclear
                        firestorm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The blast swirled around him like a red tornado. I could only see the black
                        silhouette of his
                        body. I knew with horrible certainty that my friend had just been turned into a column of ashes.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/4-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">But when the fire died, Tyson was still standing there, completely unharmed.
                        Not even his
                        grungy clothes were scorched. The bull must’ve been as surprised as I was, because before it
                        could unleash a
                        second blast, Tyson balled his fists and slammed them into the bull’s face. “BAD COW!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His fists made a crater where the bronze bull’s snout used to be. Two small
                        columns of flame
                        shot out of its ears. Tyson hit it again, and the bronze crumpled under his hands like aluminum
                        foil. The bull’s
                        face now looked like a sock puppet pulled inside out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Down!” Tyson yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The bull staggered and fell on its back. Its legs moved feebly in the air,
                        steam coming out of
                        its ruined head in odd places. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth ran over to check on me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My ankle felt like it was filled with acid, but she gave me some Olympian
                        nectar to drink from
                        her canteen, and I immediately started to feel better. There was a burning smell that I later
                        learned was me.
                        The hair on my arms had been completely singed off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The other bull?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth pointed down the hill. Clarisse had taken care of Bad Cow Number Two.
                        She’d impaled it
                        through the back leg with a celestial bronze spear. Now, with its snout half gone and a huge
                        gash in its side,
                        it was trying to run in slow motion, going in circles like some kind of merry-go-round animal.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse pulled off her helmet and marched toward us. A strand of her stringy
                        brown hair was
                        smoldering, but she didn’t seem to notice. “You—ruin—everything!” she yelled at me. “I had it
                        under control!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was too stunned to answer. Annabeth grumbled, “Good to see you too,
                        Clarisse.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Argh!” Clarisse screamed. “Don’t ever, EVER try saving me again!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Clarisse,” Annabeth said, “you’ve got wounded campers.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That sobered her up. Even Clarisse cared about the soldiers under her command.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll be back,” she growled, then trudged off to assess the damage. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at Tyson. “You didn’t die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson looked down like he was embarrassed. “I am sorry. Came to help. Disobeyed
                        you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“My fault,” Annabeth said. “I had no choice. I had to let Tyson cross the
                        boundary line to save
                        you. Otherwise, you would’ve died.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Let </i>him cross the boundary line?’” I asked. “But—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” she said, “have you ever looked at Tyson closely? I mean... in the
                        face.
                        Ignore the Mist,
                        and <i class="calibre5">really </i>look at him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Mist makes humans see only what their brains can process... I knew it could
                        fool demigods too,
                        but... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked Tyson in the face. It wasn’t easy. I’d always had trouble looking
                        directly at him,
                        though I’d never quite understood why. I’d thought it was just because he always had peanut
                        butter in his
                        crooked teeth. I forced myself to focus at his big lumpy nose, then a little higher at his eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">No, not <i class="calibre5">eyes</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">One </i>eye. One large, calf-brown eye, right in the middle
                        of his
                        forehead, with thick lashes and big tears trickling down his cheeks on either side. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson,” I stammered. “You’re a...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cyclops,” Annabeth offered. “A baby, by the looks of him. Probably why he
                        couldn’t get past
                        the boundary line as easily as the bulls. Tyson’s one of the homeless orphans.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“One of the what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They’re in almost all the big cities,” Annabeth said distastefully.
                        “They’re... <i class="calibre5">mistakes</i>, Percy. Children of nature spirits and gods...
                        Well, one
                        god in particular,
                        usually... and they don’t always come out right. No one wants them. They get tossed aside. They
                        grow up wild on the
                        streets. I don’t know how this one found you, but he obviously likes you. We should take him to
                        Chiron, let him
                        decide what to do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But the fire. How—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He’s a Cyclops.” Annabeth paused, as if she were remembering something
                        unpleasant. “They work
                        the forges of the gods. They <i class="calibre5">have </i>to be immune to fire. That’s what I
                        was trying to tell
                        you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was completely shocked. How had I never realized what Tyson was? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But I didn’t have much time to think about it just then. The whole side of the
                        hill was
                        burning. Wounded heroes needed attention. And there were still two banged-up bronze bulls to
                        dispose of, which I
                        didn’t figure would fit in our normal recycling bins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse came back over and wiped the soot off her forehead. “Jackson, if you
                        can stand, get
                        up. We need to carry the wounded back to the Big House, let Tantalus know what’s happened.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tantalus?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The activities director,” Clarisse said impatiently. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Chiron is the activities director. And where’s Argus? He’s head of security.
                        He should be
                        here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse made a sour face. “Argus got fired. You two have been gone too long.
                        Things are
                        changing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But Chiron... He’s trained kids to fight monsters for over three thousand
                        years.
                        He can’t just be
                        <i class="calibre5">gone</i>. What happened?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">That </i>happened,” Clarisse snapped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pointed to Thalia’s tree. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Every camper knew the story behind the tree. Six years ago, Grover, Annabeth,
                        and two other
                        demigods named Thalia and Luke had come to Camp Half-Blood chased by an army of monsters. When
                        they got cornered
                        on top of this hill, Thalia, a daughter of Zeus, had made her last stand here to give her
                        friends time to reach
                        safety. As she was dying, her father, Zeus, took pity on her and changed her into a pine tree.
                        Her spirit had
                        reinforced the magic borders of the camp, protecting it from monsters. The pine had been here
                        ever since, strong
                        and healthy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But now, its needles were yellow. A huge pile of dead ones littered the base of
                        the tree. In
                        the center of the trunk, three feet from the ground, was a puncture mark the size of a bullet
                        hole, oozing green
                        sap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A sliver of ice ran through my chest. Now I understood why the camp was in
                        danger. The magical
                        borders were failing because Thalia’s tree was dying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Someone had poisoned it. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">Ever come home and found your room messed up? Like some helpful person (hi,
                        Mom) has tried to
                        “clean” it, and suddenly you can’t find anything? And even if nothing is missing, you get that
                        creepy feeling
                        like somebody’s been looking through your private stuff and dusting everything with lemon
                        furniture polish? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That’s kind of the way I felt seeing Camp Half-Blood again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">On the surface, things didn’t look all that different. The Big House was still
                        there with its
                        blue gabled roof and its wraparound porch. The strawberry fields still baked in the sun. The
                        same white-columned
                        Greek buildings were scattered around the valley—the amphitheater, the combat arena, the dining
                        pavilion
                        overlooking Long Island Sound. And nestled between the woods and the creek were the same
                        cabins—a crazy
                        assortment of twelve buildings, each representing a different Olympian god. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But there was an air of danger now. You could tell something was wrong. Instead
                        of playing
                        volleyball in the sandpit, counselors and satyrs were stockpiling weapons in the tool shed.
                        Dryads armed with
                        bows and arrows talked nervously at the edge of the woods. The forest looked sickly, the grass
                        in the meadow was
                        pale yellow, and the fire marks on Half-Blood Hill stood out like ugly scars. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Somebody had messed with my favorite place in the world, and I was not... well,
                        a
                        happy camper.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As we made our way to the Big House, I recognized a lot of kids from last
                        summer. Nobody
                        stopped to talk. Nobody said, “Welcome back.” Some did double takes when they saw Tyson, but
                        most just walked
                        grimly past and carried on with their duties—running messages, toting swords to sharpen on the
                        grinding wheels.
                        The camp felt like a military school. And believe me, I know. I’ve been kicked out of a couple.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">None of that mattered to Tyson. He was absolutely fascinated by everything he
                        saw. “Whasthat!”
                        he gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The stables for pegasi,” I said. “The winged horses.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whasthat!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um... those are the toilets.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whasthat!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The cabins for the campers. If they don’t know who your Olympian parent is,
                        they put you in
                        the Hermes cabin—that brown one over there—until you’re determined. Then, once they know, they
                        put you in your
                        dad or mom’s group.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked at me in awe. “You... have a <i class="calibre5">cabin</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Number three.” I pointed to a low gray building made of sea stone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You live with friends in the cabin?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No. No, just me.” I didn’t feel like explaining. The embarrassing truth: I was
                        the only one
                        who stayed in that cabin because I wasn’t supposed to be alive. The “Big Three” gods—Zeus,
                        Poseidon, and
                        Hades—had made a pact after World War II not to have any more children with mortals. We were
                        more powerful than
                        regular half-bloods. We were too unpredictable. When we got mad we tended to cause problems...
                        like
                        World War II,
                        for instance. The “Big Three” pact had only been broken twice—once when Zeus sired Thalia, once
                        when Poseidon
                        sired me. Neither of us should’ve been born. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia had gotten herself turned into a pine tree when she was twelve. Me...
                        well,
                        I was doing my
                        best not to follow her example. I had nightmares about what Poseidon might turn me into if I
                        were ever on the
                        verge of death—plankton, maybe. Or a floating patch of kelp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When we got to the Big House, we found Chiron in his apartment, listening to
                        his favorite 1960s
                        lounge music while he packed his saddlebags. I guess I should mention—Chiron is a centaur. From
                        the waist up he
                        looks like a regular middle-aged guy with curly brown hair and a scraggly beard. From the waist
                        down, he’s a
                        white stallion. He can pass for human by compacting his lower half into a magic wheelchair. In
                        fact, he’d passed
                        himself off as my Latin teacher during my sixth-grade year. But most of the time, if the
                        ceilings are high
                        enough, he prefers hanging out in full centaur form. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/5-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">As soon as we saw him, Tyson froze. “Pony!” he cried in total rapture. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron turned, looking offended. “I beg your pardon?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth ran up and hugged him. “Chiron, what’s happening? You’re not...
                        leaving?”
                        Her voice was
                        shaky. Chiron was like a second father to her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron ruffled her hair and gave her a kindly smile. “Hello, child. And Percy,
                        my goodness.
                        You’ve grown over the year!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I swallowed. “Clarisse said you were... you were...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Fired.” Chiron’s eyes glinted with dark humor. “Ah, well, someone had to take
                        the blame. Lord
                        Zeus was most upset. The tree he’d created from the spirit of his daughter, poisoned! Mr. D had
                        to punish
                        someone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Besides himself, you mean,” I growled. Just the thought of the camp director,
                        Mr. D, made me
                        angry. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But this is crazy!” Annabeth cried. “Chiron, you couldn’t have had anything to
                        do with
                        poisoning Thalia’s tree!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nevertheless,” Chiron sighed, “some in Olympus do not trust me now, under the
                        circumstances.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What circumstances?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron’s face darkened. He stuffed a Latin-English dictionary into his
                        saddlebag while the
                        Frank Sinatra music oozed from his boom box. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson was still staring at Chiron in amazement. He whimpered like he wanted to
                        pat Chiron’s
                        flank but was afraid to come closer. “Pony?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron sniffed. “My dear young Cyclops! I am a <i
                            class="calibre5">centaur</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Chiron,” I said. “What about the tree? What happened?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He shook his head sadly. “The poison used on Thalia’s pine is something from
                        the Underworld,
                        Percy. Some venom even I have never seen. It must have come from a monster quite deep in the
                        pits of Tartarus.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then we know who’s responsible. Kro—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Do not invoke the titan lord’s name, Percy. Especially not here, not now.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But last summer he tried to cause a civil war in Olympus! This <i
                            class="calibre5">has </i>to
                        be his idea. He’d get Luke to do it, that traitor.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Perhaps,” Chiron said. “But I fear I am being held responsible because I did
                        not prevent it
                        and I cannot cure it. The tree has only a few weeks of life left unless...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Unless what?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” Chiron said. “A foolish thought. The whole valley is feeling the shock of
                        the poison. The
                        magical borders are deteriorating. The camp itself is dying. Only one source of magic would be
                        strong enough to
                        reverse the poison, and it was lost centuries ago.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What <i class="calibre5">is </i>it?” I asked. “We’ll go find it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron closed his saddlebag. He pressed the stop button on his boom box. Then
                        he turned and
                        rested his hand on my shoulder, looking me straight in the eyes. “Percy, you must promise me
                        that you will <i class="calibre5">not </i>act rashly. I told your mother I did not want you to
                        come here at all this summer.
                        It’s much too dangerous. But now that you are here, <i class="calibre5">stay </i>here. Train
                        hard. Learn to
                        fight. But do not leave.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why?” I asked. “I want to do something! I can’t just let the borders fail. The
                        whole camp will
                        be—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Overrun by monsters,” Chiron said. “Yes, I fear so. But you must not let
                        yourself be baited
                        into hasty action! This could be a trap of the titan lord. Remember last summer! He almost took
                        your life.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was true, but still, I wanted to help so badly. I also wanted to make Kronos
                        pay. I mean,
                        you’d think the titan lord would’ve learned his lesson eons ago when he was overthrown by the
                        gods. You’d think
                        getting chopped into a million pieces and cast into the darkest part of the Underworld would
                        give him a subtle
                        clue that nobody wanted him around. But no. Because he was immortal, he was still alive down
                        there in
                        Tartarus—suffering in eternal pain, hungering to return and take revenge on Olympus. He couldn’t
                        act on his own,
                        but he was great at twisting the minds of mortals and even gods to do his dirty work. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The poisoning <i class="calibre5">had </i>to be his doing. Who else would be so
                        low as to
                        attack Thalia’s tree, the only thing left of a hero who’d given her life to save her friends?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth was trying hard not to cry. Chiron brushed a tear from her cheek.
                        “Stay with Percy,
                        child,” he told her. “Keep him safe. The prophecy—remember it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I—I will.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um...” I said. “Would this be the super-dangerous prophecy that has me in it,
                        but the gods have
                        forbidden you to tell me about?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nobody answered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right,” I muttered. “Just checking.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Chiron...” Annabeth said. “You told me the gods made you immortal only so long
                        as you were
                        needed to train heroes. If they dismiss you from camp—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Swear you will do your best to keep Percy from danger,” he insisted. “Swear
                        upon the River
                        Styx.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I—I swear it upon the River Styx,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thunder rumbled outside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Very well,” Chiron said. He seemed to relax just a little. “Perhaps my name
                        will be cleared
                        and I shall return. Until then, I go to visit my wild kinsmen in the Everglades. It’s possible
                        they know of some
                        cure for the poisoned tree that I have forgotten. In any event, I will stay in exile until this
                        matter is
                        resolved... one way or another.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth stifled a sob. Chiron patted her shoulder awkwardly. “There, now,
                        child. I must
                        entrust your safety to Mr. D and the new activities director. We must hope... well, perhaps they
                        won’t destroy the
                        camp quite as quickly as I fear.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Who is this Tantalus guy, anyway?” I demanded. “Where does he get off taking
                        your job?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A conch horn blew across the valley. I hadn’t realized how late it was. It was
                        time for the
                        campers to assemble for dinner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Go,” Chiron said. “You will meet him at the pavilion. I will contact your
                        mother, Percy, and
                        let her know you’re safe. No doubt she’ll be worried by now. Just remember my warning! You are
                        in grave danger.
                        Do not think for a moment that the titan lord has forgotten you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">With that, he clopped out of the apartment and down the hall, Tyson calling
                        after him, “Pony!
                        Don’t go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I realized I’d forgotten to tell Chiron about my dream of Grover. Now it was
                        too late. The best
                        teacher I’d ever had was gone, maybe for good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson started bawling almost as bad as Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to tell them that things would be okay, but I didn’t believe it. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The sun was setting behind the dining pavilion as the campers came up from
                        their cabins. We
                        stood in the shadow of a marble column and watched them file in. Annabeth was still pretty
                        shaken up, but she
                        promised she’d talk to us later. Then she went off to join her siblings from the Athena cabin—a
                        dozen boys and
                        girls with blond hair and gray eyes like hers. Annabeth wasn’t the oldest, but she’d been at
                        camp more summers
                        than just about anybody. You could tell that by looking at her camp necklace—one bead for every
                        summer, and
                        Annabeth had six. No one questioned her right to lead the line. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Next came Clarisse, leading the Ares cabin. She had one arm in a sling and a
                        nasty-looking gash
                        on her cheek, but otherwise her encounter with the bronze bulls didn’t seem to have fazed her.
                        Someone had taped
                        a piece of paper to her back that said, <small class="calibre4">YOU MOO, GIRL</small>! But
                        nobody in her cabin
                        was bothering to tell her about it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">After the Ares kids came the Hephaestus cabin—six guys led by Charles
                        Beckendorf, a big
                        fifteen-year-old African American kid. He had hands the size of catchers’ mitts and a face that
                        was hard and
                        squinty from looking into a blacksmith’s forge all day. He was nice enough once you got to know
                        him, but no one
                        ever called him Charlie or Chuck or Charles. Most just called him Beckendorf. Rumor was he could
                        make anything.
                        Give him a chunk of metal and he could create a razor-sharp sword or a robotic warrior or a
                        singing birdbath for
                        your grandmother’s garden. Whatever you wanted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The other cabins filed in: Demeter, Apollo, Aphrodite, Dionysus. Naiads came up
                        from the canoe
                        lake. Dryads melted out of the trees. From the meadow came a dozen satyrs, who reminded me
                        painfully of Grover.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I’d always had a soft spot for the satyrs. When they were at camp, they had to
                        do all kinds of
                        odd jobs for Mr. D, the director, but their most important work was out in the real world. They
                        were the camp’s
                        seekers. They went undercover into schools all over the world, looking for potential half-bloods
                        and escorting
                        them back to camp. That’s how I’d met Grover. He had been the first one to recognize I was a
                        demigod. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">After the satyrs filed in to dinner, the Hermes cabin brought up the rear. They
                        were always the
                        biggest cabin. Last summer, it had been led by Luke, the guy who’d fought with Thalia and
                        Annabeth on top of
                        Half-Blood Hill. For a while, before Poseidon had claimed me, I’d lodged in the Hermes cabin.
                        Luke had
                        befriended me... and then he’d tried to kill me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Now the Hermes cabin was led by Travis and Connor Stoll. They weren’t twins,
                        but they looked so
                        much alike it didn’t matter. I could never remember which one was older. They were both tall and
                        skinny, with
                        mops of brown hair that hung in their eyes. They wore orange <small class="calibre4">CAMP
                            HALFBLOOD</small>
                        T-shirts untucked over baggy shorts, and they had those elfish features all Hermes’s kids had:
                        upturned
                        eyebrows, sarcastic smiles, a gleam in their eyes whenever they looked at you—like they were
                        about to drop a
                        firecracker down your shirt. I’d always thought it was funny that the god of thieves would have
                        kids with the
                        last name “Stoll,” but the only time I mentioned it to Travis and Connor, they both stared at me
                        blankly like
                        they didn’t get the joke. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As soon as the last campers had filed in, I led Tyson into the middle of the
                        pavilion.
                        Conversations faltered. Heads turned. “Who invited <i class="calibre5">that</i>?” somebody at
                        the Apollo table
                        murmured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I glared in their direction, but I couldn’t figure out who’d spoken. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">From the head table a familiar voice drawled, “Well, well, if it isn’t Peter
                        Johnson. My
                        millennium is complete.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I gritted my teeth. “<i class="calibre5">Percy Jackson</i>... sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D sipped his Diet Coke. “Yes. Well, as you young people say these days: <i
                            class="calibre5">Whatever</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He was wearing his usual leopard-pattern Hawaiian shirt, walking shorts, and
                        tennis shoes with
                        black socks. With his pudgy belly and his blotchy red face, he looked like a Las Vegas tourist
                        who’d stayed up
                        too late in the casinos. Behind him, a nervous-looking satyr was peeling the skins off grapes
                        and handing them
                        to Mr. D one at a time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D’s real name is Dionysus. The god of wine. Zeus appointed him director of
                        Camp Half-Blood
                        to dry out for a hundred years—a punishment for chasing some off-limits wood nymph. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Next to him, where Chiron usually sat (or stood, in centaur form), was someone
                        I’d never seen
                        before—a pale, horribly thin man in a threadbare orange prisoner’s jumpsuit. The number over his
                        pocket read
                        0001. He had blue shadows under his eyes, dirty fingernails, and badly cut gray hair, like his
                        last haircut had
                        been done with a weed whacker. He stared at me; his eyes made me nervous. He looked...
                        fractured.
                        Angry and
                        frustrated and hungry all at the same time. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“This boy,” Dionysus told him, “you need to watch. Poseidon’s child, you know.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah!” the prisoner said. “That one.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His tone made it obvious that he and Dionysus had already discussed me at
                        length. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I am Tantalus,” the prisoner said, smiling coldly. “On special assignment here
                        until, well,
                        until my Lord Dionysus decides otherwise. And you, Perseus Jackson, I <i class="calibre5">do
                        </i>expect you to
                        refrain from causing any more trouble.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Trouble?” I demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dionysus snapped his fingers. A newspaper appeared on the table—the front page
                        of today’s <i class="calibre5">New York Post</i>. There was my yearbook picture from Meriwether
                        Prep. It was hard for me
                        to make out the headline, but I had a pretty good guess what it said. Something like: <i
                            class="calibre5">Thirteen-Year-Old Lunatic Torches Gymnasium</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, trouble,” Tantalus said with satisfaction. “You caused plenty of it last
                        summer, I
                        understand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was too mad to speak. Like it was <i class="calibre5">my </i>fault the gods
                        had almost gotten
                        into a civil war? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A satyr inched forward nervously and set a plate of barbecue in front of
                        Tantalus. The new
                        activities director licked his lips. He looked at his empty goblet and said, “Root beer. Barq’s
                        special stock.
                        1967.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The glass filled itself with foamy soda. Tantalus stretched out his hand
                        hesitantly, as if he
                        were afraid the goblet was hot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Go on, then, old fellow,” Dionysus said, a strange sparkle in his eyes.
                        “Perhaps now it will
                        work.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tantalus grabbed for the glass, but it scooted away before he could touch it. A
                        few drops of
                        root beer spilled, and Tantalus tried to dab them up with his fingers, but the drops rolled away
                        like
                        quicksilver before he could touch them. He growled and turned toward the plate of barbecue. He
                        picked up a fork
                        and tried to stab a piece of brisket, but the plate skittered down the table and flew off the
                        end, straight into
                        the coals of the brazier. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/5-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Blast!” Tantalus muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah, well,” Dionysus said, his voice dripping with false sympathy. “Perhaps a
                        few more days.
                        Believe me, old chap, working at this camp will be torture enough. I’m sure your old curse will
                        fade
                        eventually.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Eventually,” muttered Tantalus, staring at Dionysus’s Diet Coke. “Do you have
                        any idea how dry
                        one’s throat gets after three thousand years?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re that spirit from the Fields of Punishment,” I said. “The one who stands
                        in the lake
                        with the fruit tree hanging over you, but you can’t eat or drink.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tantalus sneered at me. “A real scholar, aren’t you, boy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You must’ve done something really horrible when you were alive,” I said,
                        mildly impressed.
                        “What was it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tantalus’s eyes narrowed. Behind him, the satyrs were shaking their heads
                        vigorously, trying to
                        warn me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll be watching you, Percy Jackson,” Tantalus said. “I don’t want any
                        problems at my camp.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Your </i>camp has problems already... sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, go sit down, Johnson,” Dionysus sighed. “I believe that table over there
                        is yours—the one
                        where no one else ever wants to sit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My face was burning, but I knew better than to talk back. Dionysus was an
                        overgrown brat, but
                        he was an immortal, superpowerful overgrown brat. I said, “Come on, Tyson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, no,” Tantalus said. “The monster stays here. We must decide what to do
                        with it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Him</i>,” I snapped. “His name is Tyson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The new activities director raised an eyebrow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson saved the camp,” I insisted. “He pounded those bronze bulls. Otherwise
                        they would’ve
                        burned down this whole place.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes,” Tantalus sighed, “and <i class="calibre5">what </i>a pity that would’ve
                        been.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dionysus snickered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Leave us,” Tantalus ordered, “while we decide this creature’s fate.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson looked at me with fear in his one big eye, but I knew I couldn’t disobey
                        a direct order
                        from the camp directors. Not openly, anyway. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll be right over here, big guy,” I promised. “Don’t worry. We’ll find you a
                        good place to
                        sleep tonight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson nodded. “I believe you. You are my friend.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Which made me feel a whole lot guiltier. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I trudged over to the Poseidon table and slumped onto the bench. A wood nymph
                        brought me a
                        plate of Olympian olive-and-pepperoni pizza, but I wasn’t hungry. I’d been almost killed twice
                        today. I’d
                        managed to end my school year with a complete disaster. Camp Half-Blood was in serious trouble
                        and Chiron had
                        told me not to do anything about it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t feel very thankful, but I took my dinner, as was customary, up to the
                        bronze brazier
                        and scraped part of it into the flames. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Poseidon,” I murmured, “accept my offering.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">And send me some help while you’re at it</i>, I prayed
                        silently. <i class="calibre5">Please</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The smoke from the burning pizza changed into something fragrant—the smell of a
                        clean sea
                        breeze with wildflowers mixed in—but I had no idea if that meant my father was really listening.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/5-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I went back to my seat. I didn’t think things could get much worse. But then
                        Tantalus had one
                        of the satyrs blow the conch horn to get our attention for announcements. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">“Yes, well,” Tantalus said, once the talking had died down. “Another fine meal!
                        Or so I am
                        told.” As he spoke, he inched his hand toward his refilled dinner plate, as if maybe the food
                        wouldn’t notice
                        what he was doing, but it did. It shot away down the table as soon as he got within six inches.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And here on my first day of authority,” he continued, “I’d like to say what a
                        pleasant form of
                        punishment it is to be here. Over the course of the summer, I hope to torture, er, interact with
                        each and every
                        one of you children. You all look good enough to eat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dionysus clapped politely, leading to some halfhearted applause from the
                        satyrs. Tyson was
                        still standing at the head table, looking uncomfortable, but every time he tried to scoot out of
                        the limelight,
                        Tantalus pulled him back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And now some changes!” Tantalus gave the campers a crooked smile. “We are
                        reinstituting the
                        chariot races!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Murmuring broke out at all the tables—excitement, fear, disbelief. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now I know,” Tantalus continued, raising his voice, “that these races were
                        discontinued some
                        years ago due to, ah, technical problems.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Three deaths and twenty-six mutilations,” someone at the Apollo table called.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, yes!” Tantalus said. “But I know that you will all join me in welcoming
                        the return of
                        this camp tradition. Golden laurels will go to the winning charioteers each month. Teams may
                        register in the
                        morning! The first race will be held in three days time. We will release you from most of your
                        regular
                        activities to prepare your chariots and choose your horses. Oh, and did I mention, the
                        victorious team’s cabin
                        will have no chores for the month in which they win?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">An explosion of excited conversation—no KP for a whole month? No stable
                        cleaning? Was he
                        serious? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then the last person I expected to object did so. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But, sir!” Clarisse said. She looked nervous, but she stood up to speak from
                        the Ares table.
                        Some of the campers snickered when they saw the <small class="calibre4">YOU MOO</small>, <small
                            class="calibre4">GIRL!</small> sign on her back. “What about patrol duty? I mean, if we drop
                        everything to
                        ready our chariots—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah, the hero of the day,” Tantalus exclaimed. “Brave Clarisse, who
                        single-handedly bested the
                        bronze bulls!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse blinked, then blushed. “Um, I didn’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And modest, too.” Tantalus grinned. “Not to worry, my dear! This is a summer
                        camp. We are here
                        to enjoy ourselves, yes?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But the tree—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And now,” Tantalus said, as several of Clarisse’s cabin mates pulled her back
                        into her seat,
                        “before we proceed to the campfire and sing-along, one slight housekeeping issue. Percy Jackson
                        and Annabeth
                        Chase have seen fit, for some reason, to bring <i class="calibre5">this </i>here.” Tantalus
                        waved a hand toward
                        Tyson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Uneasy murmuring spread among the campers. A lot of sideways looks at me. I
                        wanted to kill
                        Tantalus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now, of course,” he said, “Cyclopes have a reputation for being bloodthirsty
                        monsters with a
                        very small brain capacity. Under normal circumstances, I would release this beast into the woods
                        and have you
                        hunt it down with torches and pointed sticks. But who knows? Perhaps this Cyclops is not as
                        horrible as most of
                        its brethren. Until it proves worthy of destruction, we need a place to keep it! I’ve thought
                        about the stables,
                        but that will make the horses nervous. Hermes’s cabin, possibly?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Silence at the Hermes table. Travis and Connor Stoll developed a sudden
                        interest in the
                        tablecloth. I couldn’t blame them. The Hermes cabin was always full to bursting. There was no
                        way they could
                        take in a six-foot-three Cyclops. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come now,” Tantalus chided. “The monster may be able to do some menial chores.
                        Any suggestions
                        as to where such a beast should be kenneled?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Suddenly everybody gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tantalus scooted away from Tyson in surprise. All I could do was stare in
                        disbelief at the
                        brilliant green light that was about to change my life—a dazzling holographic image that had
                        appeared above
                        Tyson’s head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">With a sickening twist in my stomach, I remembered what Annabeth had said about
                        Cyclopes, <i class="calibre5">They’re the children of nature spirits and gods... Well, one god
                            in
                            particular, usually... </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Swirling over Tyson was a glowing green trident—the same symbol that had
                        appeared above me the
                        day Poseidon had claimed me as his son. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a moment of awed silence. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Being claimed was a rare event. Some campers waited in vain for it their whole
                        lives. When I’d
                        been claimed by Poseidon last summer, everyone had reverently knelt. But now, they followed
                        Tantalus’s lead, and
                        Tantalus roared with laughter. “Well! I think we know where to put the beast now. By the gods, I
                        can see the
                        family resemblance!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Everybody laughed except Annabeth and a few of my other friends. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson didn’t seem to notice. He was too mystified, trying to swat the glowing
                        trident that was
                        now fading over his head. He was too innocent to understand how much they were making fun of
                        him, how cruel
                        people were. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But I got it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I had a new cabin mate. I had a monster for a half-brother. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">The next few days were torture, just like Tantalus wanted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">First there was Tyson moving into the Poseidon cabin, giggling to himself every
                        fifteen seconds
                        and saying, “Percy is my brother?” like he’d just won the lottery. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Aw, Tyson,” I’d say. “It’s not that simple.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But there was no explaining it to him. He was in heaven. And me... as much as I
                        liked the big guy,
                        I couldn’t help feeling embarrassed. Ashamed. There, I said it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My father, the all-powerful Poseidon, had gotten moony-eyed for some nature
                        spirit, and Tyson
                        had been the result. I mean, I’d read the myths about Cyclopes. I even remembered that they were
                        often
                        Poseidon’s children. But I’d never really processed that this made them my... family. Until I
                        had
                        Tyson living with
                        me in the next bunk. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And then there were the comments from the other campers. Suddenly, I wasn’t
                        Percy Jackson, the
                        cool guy who’d retrieved Zeus’s lightning bolt last summer. Now I was Percy Jackson, the poor
                        schmuck with the
                        ugly monster for a brother. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He’s not my <i class="calibre5">real </i>brother!” I protested whenever Tyson
                        wasn’t around.
                        “He’s more like a half-brother on the monstrous side of the family. Like... a half-brother twice
                        removed, or
                        something.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nobody bought it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I admit—I was angry at my dad. I felt like being his son was now a joke. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth tried to make me feel better. She suggested we team up for the chariot
                        race to take
                        our minds off our problems. Don’t get me wrong—we both hated Tantalus and we were worried sick
                        about camp—but we
                        didn’t know what to do about it. Until we could come up with some brilliant plan to save
                        Thalia’s tree, we
                        figured we might as well go along with the races. After all, Annabeth’s mom, Athena, had
                        invented the chariot,
                        and my dad had created horses. Together we would <i class="calibre5">own </i>that track. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">One morning Annabeth and I were sitting by the canoe lake sketching chariot
                        designs when some
                        jokers from Aphrodite’s cabin walked by and asked me if I needed to borrow some eyeliner for my
                        eye... “Oh sorry,
                        <i class="calibre5">eyes</i>.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As they walked away laughing, Annabeth grumbled, “Just ignore them, Percy. It
                        isn’t your fault
                        you have a monster for a brother.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He’s <i class="calibre5">not </i>my brother!” I snapped. “And he’s not a
                        monster, either!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth raised her eyebrows. “Hey, don’t get mad at me! And technically, he <i
                            class="calibre5">is </i>a monster.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well <i class="calibre5">you </i>gave him permission to enter the camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Because it was the only way to save your life! I mean... I’m sorry, Percy, I
                        didn’t expect
                        Poseidon to <i class="calibre5">claim </i>him. Cyclopes are the most deceitful, treacherous—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He is not! What have you got against Cyclopes, anyway?” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth’s ears turned pink. I got the feeling there was something she wasn’t
                        telling
                        me—something bad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Just forget it,” she said. “Now, the axle for this chariot—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re treating him like he’s this horrible thing,” I said. “He saved my
                        life.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth threw down her pencil and stood. “Then maybe you should design a
                        chariot with <i class="calibre5">him</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Maybe I should.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Fine!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Fine!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She stormed off and left me feeling even worse than before. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The next couple of days, I tried to keep my mind off my problems. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Silena Beauregard, one of the nicer girls from Aphrodite’s cabin, gave me my
                        first riding
                        lesson on a pegasus. She explained that there was only one immortal winged horse named Pegasus,
                        who still
                        wandered free somewhere in the skies, but over the eons he’d sired a lot of children, none quite
                        so fast or
                        heroic, but all named after the first and greatest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Being the son of the sea god, I never liked going into the air. My dad had this
                        rivalry with
                        Zeus, so I tried to stay out of the lord of the sky’s domain as much as possible. But riding a
                        winged horse felt
                        different. It didn’t make me nearly as nervous as being in an airplane. Maybe that was because
                        my dad had
                        created horses out of sea foam, so the pegasi were sort of... neutral territory. I could
                        understand
                        their thoughts.
                        I wasn’t surprised when my pegasus went galloping over the treetops or chased a flock of
                        seagulls into a cloud.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The problem was that Tyson wanted to ride the “chicken ponies,” too, but the
                        pegasi got
                        skittish whenever he approached. I told them telepathically that Tyson wouldn’t hurt them, but
                        they didn’t seem
                        to believe me. That made Tyson cry. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The only person at camp who had <i class="calibre5">no </i>problem with Tyson
                        was Beckendorf
                        from the Hephaestus cabin. The blacksmith god had always worked with Cyclopes in his forges, so
                        Beckendorf took
                        Tyson down to the armory to teach him metalworking. He said he’d have Tyson crafting magic items
                        like a master
                        in no time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">After lunch, I worked out in the arena with Apollo’s cabin. Swordplay had
                        always been my
                        strength. People said I was better at it than any camper in the last hundred years, except maybe
                        Luke. People
                        always compared me to Luke. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thrashed the Apollo guys easily. I should’ve been testing myself against the
                        Ares and Athena
                        cabins, since they had the best sword fighters, but I didn’t get along with Clarisse and her
                        siblings, and after
                        my argument with Annabeth, I just didn’t want to see her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I went to archery class, even though I was terrible at it, and it wasn’t the
                        same without
                        Chiron teaching. In arts and crafts, I started a marble bust of Poseidon, but it started looking
                        like Sylvester
                        Stallone, so I ditched it. I scaled the climbing wall in full lava-and-earthquake mode. And in
                        the evenings, I
                        did border patrol. Even though Tantalus had insisted we forget trying to protect the camp, some
                        of the campers
                        had quietly kept it up, working out a schedule during our free times. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sat at the top of Half-Blood Hill and watched the dryads come and go, singing
                        to the dying
                        pine tree. Satyrs brought their reed pipes and played nature magic songs, and for a while the
                        pine needles
                        seemed to get fuller. The flowers on the hill smelled a little sweeter and the grass looked
                        greener. But as soon
                        as the music stopped, the sickness crept back into the air. The whole hill seemed to be
                        infected, dying from the
                        poison that had sunk into the tree’s roots. The longer I sat there, the angrier I got. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Luke had done this. I remembered his sly smile, the dragon-claw scar across his
                        face. He’d
                        pretended to be my friend, and the whole time he’d been Kronos’s number-one servant. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I opened the palm of my hand. The scar Luke had given me last summer was
                        fading, but I could
                        still see it—a white asterisk-shaped wound where his pit scorpion had stung me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought about what Luke had told me right before he’d tried to kill me: <i
                            class="calibre5">Good-bye, Percy. There is a new Golden Age coming. You won’t be part of it.

                    <p class="no-indent">At night, I had more dreams of Grover. Sometimes, I just heard snatches of his
                        voice. Once, I
                        heard him say: <i class="calibre5">It’s here. </i>Another time: <i class="calibre5">He likes
                            sheep. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought about telling Annabeth about my dreams, but I would’ve felt stupid. I
                        mean, <i class="calibre5">He likes sheep</i>? She would’ve thought I was crazy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The night before the race, Tyson and I finished our chariot. It was wicked
                        cool. Tyson had made
                        the metal parts in the armory’s forges. I’d sanded the wood and put the carriage together. It
                        was blue and
                        white, with wave designs on the sides and a trident painted on the front. After all that work,
                        it seemed only
                        fair that Tyson would ride shotgun with me, though I knew the horses wouldn’t like it, and
                        Tyson’s extra weight
                        would slow us down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As we were turning in for bed, Tyson said, “You are mad?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I realized I’d been scowling. “Nah. I’m not mad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He lay down in his bunk and was quiet in the dark. His body was way too long
                        for his bed. When
                        he pulled up the covers, his feet stuck out the bottom. “I am a monster.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t say that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It is okay. I will be a <i class="calibre5">good </i>monster. Then you will
                        not have to be
                        mad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know what to say. I stared at the ceiling and felt like I was dying
                        slowly, right
                        along with Thalia’s tree. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s just... I never had a half-brother before.” I tried to keep my voice from
                        cracking. “It’s
                        really different for me. And I’m worried about the camp. And another friend of mine, Grover...
                        he
                        might be in
                        trouble. I keep feeling like I should be doing something to help, but I don’t know what.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson said nothing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m sorry,” I told him. “It’s not your fault. I’m mad at Poseidon. I feel like
                        he’s trying to
                        embarrass me, like he’s trying to compare us or something, and I don’t understand why.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I heard a deep rumbling sound. Tyson was snoring. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sighed. “Good night, big guy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And I closed my eyes, too. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">In my dream, Grover was wearing a wedding dress. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It didn’t fit him very well. The gown was too long and the hem was caked with
                        dried mud. The
                        neckline kept falling off his shoulders. A tattered veil covered his face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He was standing in a dank cave, lit only by torches. There was a cot in one
                        corner and an
                        old-fashioned loom in the other, a length of white cloth half woven on the frame. And he was
                        staring right at
                        me, like I was a TV program he’d been waiting for. “Thank the gods!” he yelped. “Can you hear
                        me?” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">My dream-self was slow to respond. I was still looking around, taking in the
                        stalactite
                        ceiling, the stench of sheep and goats, the growling and grumbling and bleating sounds that
                        seemed to echo from
                        behind a refrigerator-sized boulder, which was blocking the room’s only exit, as if there were a
                        much larger
                        cavern beyond it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy?” Grover said. “Please, I don’t have the strength to project any better.
                        You <i class="calibre5">have </i>to hear me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I hear you,” I said. “Grover, what’s going on?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">From behind the boulder, a monstrous voice yelled, “Honeypie! Are you done
                        yet?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover flinched. He called out in falsetto, “Not quite, dearest! A few more
                        days!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bah! Hasn’t it been two weeks yet?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“N-no, dearest. Just five days. That leaves twelve more to go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The monster was silent, maybe trying to do the math. He must’ve been worse at
                        arithmetic than I
                        was, because he said, “All right, but hurry! I want to SEEEEE under that veil, heh-heh-heh.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover turned back to me. “You have to help me! No time! I’m stuck in this
                        cave. On an island
                        in the sea.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Where?</i>” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t know exactly! I went to Florida and turned left.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What? How did you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s a trap!” Grover said. “It’s the reason no satyr has ever returned from
                        this quest. He’s a
                        shepherd, Percy! And he <i class="calibre5">has </i>it. Its nature magic is <i
                            class="calibre5">so </i>powerful
                        it smells just like the great god Pan! The satyrs come here thinking they’ve found Pan, and they
                        get trapped and
                        eaten by Polyphemus!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Poly-who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Cyclops!” Grover said, exasperated. “I almost got away. I made it all the
                        way to St.
                        Augustine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But he followed you,” I said, remembering my first dream. “And trapped you in
                        a bridal
                        boutique.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s right,” Grover said. “My first empathy link must’ve worked then. Look,
                        this bridal
                        dress is the only thing keeping me alive. He thinks I smell good, but I told him it was just
                        goat-scented
                        perfume. Thank goodness he can’t see very well. His eye is still half blind from the last time
                        somebody poked it
                        out. But soon he’ll realize what I am. He’s only giving me two weeks to finish the bridal train,
                        and he’s
                        getting impatient!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait a minute. This Cyclops thinks you’re—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes!” Grover wailed. “He thinks I’m a lady Cyclops and he wants to marry me!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Under different circumstances, I might’ve busted out laughing, but Grover’s
                        voice was deadly
                        serious. He was shaking with fear. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll come rescue you,” I promised. “Where are you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Sea of Monsters, of course!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The sea of <i class="calibre5">what</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I told you! I don’t know exactly where! And look, Percy... um, I’m really
                        sorry
                        about this, but
                        this empathy link... well, I had no choice. Our emotions are connected now. If I die...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t tell me, I’ll die too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, well, perhaps not. You might live for years in a vegetative state. But,
                        uh, it would be a
                        lot better if you got me out of here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Honeypie!” the monster bellowed. “Dinnertime! Yummy yummy sheep meat!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover whimpered. “I have to go. Hurry!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait! You said ‘it’ was here. What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But Grover’s voice was already growing fainter. “Sweet dreams. Don’t let me
                        die!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The dream faded and I woke with a start. It was early morning. Tyson was
                        staring down at me,
                        his one big brown eye full of concern. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Are you okay?” he asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His voice sent a chill down my back, because he sounded almost exactly like the
                        monster I’d
                        heard in my dream. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The morning of the race was hot and humid. Fog lay low on the ground like sauna
                        steam. Millions
                        of birds were roosting in the trees—fat gray-and-white pigeons, except they didn’t coo like
                        regular pigeons.
                        They made this annoying metallic screeching sound that reminded me of submarine radar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The racetrack had been built in a grassy field between the archery range and
                        the woods.
                        Hephaestus’s cabin had used the bronze bulls, which were completely tame since they’d had their
                        heads smashed
                        in, to plow an oval track in a matter of minutes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There were rows of stone steps for the spectators—Tantalus, the satyrs, a few
                        dryads, and all
                        of the campers who weren’t participating. Mr. D didn’t show. He never got up before ten o’clock.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right!” Tantalus announced as the teams began to assemble. A naiad had brought
                        him a big
                        platter of pastries, and as Tantalus spoke, his right hand chased a chocolate éclair across the
                        judge’s table.
                        “You all know the rules. A quarter-mile track. Twice around to win. Two horses per chariot. Each
                        team will
                        consist of a driver and a fighter. Weapons are allowed. Dirty tricks are expected. But try not
                        to kill anybody!”
                        Tantalus smiled at us like we were all naughty children. “Any killing will result in harsh
                        punishment. No
                        s’mores at the campfire for a week! Now ready your chariots!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Beckendorf led the Hephaestus team onto the track. They had a sweet ride made
                        of bronze and
                        iron—even the horses, which were magical automatons like the Colchis bulls. I had no doubt that
                        their chariot
                        had all kinds of mechanical traps and more fancy options than a fully loaded Maserati. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Ares chariot was bloodred, and pulled by two grisly horse skeletons.
                        Clarisse climbed
                        aboard with a batch of javelins, spiked balls, caltrops, and a bunch of other nasty toys. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo’s chariot was trim and graceful and completely gold, pulled by two
                        beautiful palominos.
                        Their fighter was armed with a bow, though he had promised not to shoot regular pointed arrows
                        at the opposing
                        drivers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Hermes’s chariot was green and kind of old-looking, as if it hadn’t been out of
                        the garage in
                        years. It didn’t look like anything special, but it was manned by the Stoll brothers, and I
                        shuddered to think
                        what dirty tricks they’d schemed up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That left two chariots: one driven by Annabeth, and the other by me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before the race began, I tried to approach Annabeth and tell her about my
                        dream. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She perked up when I mentioned Grover, but when I told her what he’d said, she
                        seemed to get
                        distant again, suspicious. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re trying to distract me,” she decided. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What? No I’m not!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, right! Like Grover would just happen to stumble across the <i
                            class="calibre5">one
                        </i>thing that could save the camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She rolled her eyes. “Go back to your chariot, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m not making this up. He’s in trouble, Annabeth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She hesitated. I could tell she was trying to decide whether or not to trust
                        me. Despite our
                        occasional fights, we’d been through a lot together. And I knew she would never want anything
                        bad to happen to
                        Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, an empathy link is so hard to do. I mean, it’s more likely you really
                        were dreaming.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Oracle,” I said. “We could consult the Oracle.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth frowned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Last summer, before my quest, I’d visited the strange spirit that lived in the
                        Big House attic
                        and it had given me a prophecy that came true in ways I’d never expected. The experience had
                        freaked me out for
                        months. Annabeth knew I’d never suggest going back there if I wasn’t completely serious. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before she could answer, the conch horn sounded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Charioteers!” Tantalus called. “To your mark!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll talk later,” Annabeth told me, “<i class="calibre5">after </i>I win.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As I was walking back to my own chariot, I noticed how many more pigeons were
                        in the trees
                        now—screeching like crazy, making the whole forest rustle. Nobody else seemed to be paying them
                        much attention,
                        but they made me nervous. Their beaks glinted strangely. Their eyes seemed shinier than regular
                        birds. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson was having trouble getting our horses under control. I had to talk to
                        them a long time
                        before they would settle down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">He’s a monster, lord! </i>they complained to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">He’s a son of Poseidon</i>, I told them. <i
                            class="calibre5">Just
                            like... well, just like me. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">No! </i>they insisted. <i class="calibre5">Monster!
                            Horse-eater! Not
                            trusted! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">I’ll give you sugar cubes at the end of the race, </i>I
                        said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Sugar cubes?</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Very big sugar cubes. And apples. Did I mention the
                            apples?</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally they agreed to let me harness them. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/6-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Now, if you’ve never seen a Greek chariot, it’s built for speed, not safety or
                        comfort. It’s
                        basically a wooden basket, open at the back, mounted on an axle between two wheels. The driver
                        stands up the
                        whole time, and you can feel every bump in the road. The carriage is made of such light wood
                        that if you wipe
                        out making the hairpin turns at either end of the track, you’ll probably tip over and crush both
                        the chariot and
                        yourself. It’s an even better rush than skateboarding. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I took the reins and maneuvered the chariot to the starting line. I gave Tyson
                        a ten-foot pole
                        and told him that his job was to push the other chariots away if they got too close, and to
                        deflect anything
                        they might try to throw at us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No hitting ponies with the stick,” he insisted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” I agreed. “Or people, either, if you can help it. We’re going to run a
                        clean race. Just
                        keep the distractions away and let me concentrate on driving.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We will win!” He beamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We are <i class="calibre5">so </i>going to lose, I thought to myself, but I <i
                            class="calibre5">had </i>to try. I wanted to show the others... well, I wasn’t sure what,
                        exactly. That Tyson
                        wasn’t such a bad guy? That I wasn’t ashamed of being seen with him in public? Maybe that they
                        hadn’t hurt me
                        with all their jokes and name-calling? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As the chariots lined up, more shiny-eyed pigeons gathered in the woods. They
                        were screeching
                        so loudly the campers in the stands were starting to take notice, glancing nervously at the
                        trees, which
                        shivered under the weight of the birds. Tantalus didn’t look concerned, but he did have to speak
                        up to be heard
                        over the noise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Charioteers!” he shouted. “Attend your mark!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He waved his hand and the starting signal dropped. The chariots roared to life.
                        Hooves
                        thundered against the dirt. The crowd cheered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Almost immediately there was a loud nasty <i class="calibre5">crack! </i>I
                        looked back in time
                        to see the Apollo chariot flip over. The Hermes chariot had rammed into it—maybe by mistake,
                        maybe not. The
                        riders were thrown free, but their panicked horses dragged the golden chariot diagonally across
                        the track. The
                        Hermes team, Travis and Connor Stoll, were laughing at their good luck, but not for long. The
                        Apollo horses
                        crashed into theirs, and the Hermes chariot flipped too, leaving a pile of broken wood and four
                        rearing horses
                        in the dust. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Two chariots down in the first twenty feet. I loved this sport. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned my attention back to the front. We were making good time, pulling
                        ahead of Ares, but
                        Annabeth’s chariot was way ahead of us. She was already making her turn around the first post,
                        her javelin man
                        grinning and waving at us, shouting: “See ya!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Hephaestus chariot was starting to gain on us, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Beckendorf pressed a button, and a panel slid open on the side of his chariot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry, Percy!” he yelled. Three sets of balls and chains shot straight toward
                        our wheels. They
                        would’ve wrecked us completely if Tyson hadn’t whacked them aside with a quick swipe of his
                        pole. He gave the
                        Hephaestus chariot a good shove and sent them skittering sideways while we pulled ahead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nice work, Tyson!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Birds!” he cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were whipping along so fast it was hard to hear or see anything, but Tyson
                        pointed toward
                        the woods and I saw what he was worried about. The pigeons had risen from the trees. They were
                        spiraling like a
                        huge tornado, heading toward the track. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">No big deal</i>, I told myself. <i class="calibre5">They’re
                            just pigeons.
                        </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to concentrate on the race. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We made our first turn, the wheels creaking under us, the chariot threatening
                        to tip, but we
                        were now only ten feet behind Annabeth. If I could just get a little closer, Tyson could use his
                        pole.... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth’s fighter wasn’t smiling now. He pulled a javelin from his collection
                        and took aim at
                        me. He was about to throw when we heard the screaming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The pigeons were swarming—thousands of them dive-bombing the spectators in the
                        stands,
                        attacking the other chariots. Beckendorf was mobbed. His fighter tried to bat the birds away but
                        he couldn’t see
                        anything. The chariot veered off course and plowed through the strawberry fields, the mechanical
                        horses
                        steaming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In the Ares chariot, Clarisse barked an order to her fighter, who quickly threw
                        a screen of
                        camouflage netting over their basket. The birds swarmed around it, pecking and clawing at the
                        fighter’s hands as
                        he tried to hold up the net, but Clarisse just gritted her teeth and kept driving. Her skeletal
                        horses seemed
                        immune to the distraction. The pigeons pecked uselessly at their empty eye sockets and flew
                        through their rib
                        cages, but the stallions kept right on running. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The spectators weren’t so lucky. The birds were slashing at any bit of exposed
                        flesh, driving
                        everyone into a panic. Now that the birds were closer, it was clear they weren’t normal pigeons.
                        Their eyes were
                        beady and evil-looking. Their beaks were made of bronze, and judging from the yelps of the
                        campers, they must’ve
                        been razor sharp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stymphalian birds!” Annabeth yelled. She slowed down and pulled her chariot
                        alongside mine.
                        “They’ll strip everyone to bones if we don’t drive them away!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson,” I said, “we’re turning around!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Going the wrong way?” he asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Always,” I grumbled, but I steered the chariot toward the stands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth rode right next to me. She shouted, “Heroes, to arms!” But I wasn’t
                        sure anyone could
                        hear her over the screeching of the birds and the general chaos. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I held my reins in one hand and managed to draw Riptide as a wave of birds
                        dived at my face,
                        their metal beaks snapping. I slashed them out of the air and they exploded into dust and
                        feathers, but there
                        were still millions of them left. One nailed me in the back end and I almost jumped straight out
                        of the chariot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth wasn’t having much better luck. The closer we got to the stands, the
                        thicker the cloud
                        of birds became. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/6-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Some of the spectators were trying to fight back. The Athena campers were
                        calling for shields.
                        The archers from Apollo’s cabin brought out their bows and arrows, ready to slay the menace, but
                        with so many
                        campers mixed in with the birds, it wasn’t safe to shoot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Too many!” I yelled to Annabeth. “How do you get rid of them?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She stabbed at a pigeon with her knife. “Hercules used noise! Brass bells! He
                        scared them away
                        with the most horrible sound he could—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her eyes got wide. “Percy... Chiron’s collection!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I understood instantly. “You think it’ll work?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She handed her fighter the reins and leaped from her chariot into mine like it
                        was the easiest
                        thing in the world. “To the Big House! It’s our only chance!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse has just pulled across the finish line, completely unopposed, and
                        seemed to notice for
                        the first time how serious the bird problem was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When she saw us driving away, she yelled, “You’re <i class="calibre5">run</i><i
                            class="calibre5">ning</i>? The fight is here, cowards!” She drew her sword and charged for
                        the stands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I urged our horses into a gallop. The chariot rumbled through the strawberry
                        fields, across the
                        volleyball pit, and lurched to a halt in front of the Big House. Annabeth and I ran inside,
                        tearing down the
                        hallway to Chiron’s apartment. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His boom box was still on his nightstand. So were his favorite CDs. I grabbed
                        the most
                        repulsive one I could find, Annabeth snatched the boom box, and together we ran back outside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Down at the track, the chariots were in flames. Wounded campers ran in every
                        direction, with
                        birds shredding their clothes and pulling out their hair, while Tantalus chased breakfast
                        pastries around the
                        stands, every once in a while yelling, “Everything’s under control! Not to worry!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We pulled up to the finish line. Annabeth got the boom box ready. I prayed the
                        batteries
                        weren’t dead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I pressed <small class="calibre4">PLAY</small> and started up Chiron’s
                        favorite—the <i class="calibre5">All-Time Greatest Hits of Dean Martin</i>. Suddenly the air was
                        filled with violins and a
                        bunch of guys moaning in Italian. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/6-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The demon pigeons went nuts. They started flying in circles, running into each
                        other like they
                        wanted to bash their own brains out. Then they abandoned the track altogether and flew skyward
                        in a huge dark
                        wave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now!” shouted Annabeth. “Archers!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">With clear targets, Apollo’s archers had flawless aim. Most of them could nock
                        five or six
                        arrows at once. Within minutes, the ground was littered with dead bronze-beaked pigeons, and the
                        survivors were
                        a distant trail of smoke on the horizon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The camp was saved, but the wreckage wasn’t pretty. Most of the chariots had
                        been completely
                        destroyed. Almost everyone was wounded, bleeding from multiple bird pecks. The kids from
                        Aphrodite’s cabin were
                        screaming because their hairdos had been ruined and their clothes pooped on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bravo!” Tantalus said, but he wasn’t looking at me or Annabeth. “We have our
                        first winner!” He
                        walked to the finish line and awarded the golden laurels for the race to a stunned-looking
                        Clarisse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then he turned and smiled at me. “And now to punish the troublemakers who
                        disrupted this race.”

                    <p class="no-indent">The way Tantalus saw it, the Stymphalian birds had simply been minding their
                        own business in
                        the woods and would not have attacked if Annabeth, Tyson, and I hadn’t disturbed them with our
                        bad chariot
                        driving. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">This was so completely unfair, I told Tantalus to go chase a doughnut, which
                        didn’t help his
                        mood. He sentenced us to kitchen patrol—scrubbing pots and platters all afternoon in the
                        underground kitchen
                        with the cleaning harpies. The harpies washed with lava instead of water, to get that
                        extra-clean sparkle and
                        kill ninety-nine point nine percent of all germs, so Annabeth and I had to wear asbestos gloves
                        and aprons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson didn’t mind. He plunged his bare hands right in and started scrubbing,
                        but Annabeth and I
                        had to suffer through hours of hot, dangerous work, especially since there were tons of extra
                        plates. Tantalus
                        had ordered a special luncheon banquet to celebrate Clarisse’s chariot victory—a full-course
                        meal featuring
                        country-fried Stymphalian death-bird. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The only good thing about our punishment was that it gave Annabeth and me a
                        common enemy and
                        lots of time to talk. After listening to my dream about Grover again, she looked like she might
                        be starting to
                        believe me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“If he’s really found it,” she murmured, “and if we could retrieve it—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hold on,” I said. “You act like this... whatever-it-is Grover found is the
                        only
                        thing in the
                        world that could save the camp. What <i class="calibre5">is </i>it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll give you a hint. What do you get when you skin a ram?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Messy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She sighed. “A <i class="calibre5">fleece</i>. The coat of a ram is called a
                        fleece. And if
                        that ram happens to have golden wool—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Golden Fleece. Are you serious?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth scraped a plateful of death-bird bones into the lava. “Percy, remember
                        the Gray
                        Sisters? They said they knew the location of the thing you seek. And they mentioned Jason. Three
                        thousand years
                        ago, they told <i class="calibre5">him </i>how to find the Golden Fleece. You <i
                            class="calibre5">do </i>know
                        the story of Jason and the Argonauts?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I said. “That old movie with the clay skeletons.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth rolled her eyes. “Oh my gods, Percy! You are so hopeless.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">What?</i>” I demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Just listen. The real story of the Fleece: there were these two children of
                        Zeus, Cadmus and
                        Europa, okay? They were about to get offered up as human sacrifices, when they prayed to Zeus to
                        save them. So
                        Zeus sent this magical flying ram with golden wool, which picked them up in Greece and carried
                        them all the way
                        to Colchis in Asia Minor. Well, actually it carried Cadmus. Europa fell off and died along the
                        way, but that’s
                        not important.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It was probably important to her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The <i class="calibre5">point </i>is, when Cadmus got to Colchis, he
                        sacrificed the golden ram
                        to the gods and hung the Fleece in a tree in the middle of the kingdom. The Fleece brought
                        prosperity to the
                        land. Animals stopped getting sick. Plants grew better. Farmers had bumper crops. Plagues never
                        visited. That’s
                        why Jason wanted the Fleece. It can revitalize any land where it’s placed. It cures sickness,
                        strengthens
                        nature, cleans up pollution—” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“It could cure Thalia’s tree.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth nodded. “And it would totally strengthen the borders of Camp
                        Half-Blood. But Percy,
                        the Fleece has been missing for centuries. Tons of heroes have searched for it with no luck.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But Grover found it,” I said. “He went looking for Pan and he found the Fleece
                        instead because
                        they both radiate nature magic. It makes sense, Annabeth. We can rescue him and save the camp at
                        the same time.
                        It’s perfect!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth hesitated. “A little <i class="calibre5">too </i>perfect, don’t you
                        think? What if
                        it’s a trap?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I remembered last summer, how Kronos had manipulated our quest. He’d almost
                        fooled us into
                        helping him start a war that would’ve destroyed Western Civilization. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What choice do we have?” I asked. “Are you going to help me rescue Grover or
                        not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She glanced at Tyson, who’d lost interest in our conversation and was happily
                        making toy boats
                        out of cups and spoons in the lava. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” she said under her breath, “we’ll have to fight a Cyclops. Polyphemus,
                        the <i class="calibre5">worst </i>of the Cyclopes. And there’s only one place his island could
                        be. The Sea of
                        Monsters.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Where’s that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She stared at me like she thought I was playing dumb. “The Sea of Monsters. The
                        same sea
                        Odysseus sailed through, and Jason, and Aeneas, and all the others.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You mean the Mediterranean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No. Well, yes... but no.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Another straight answer. Thanks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Look, Percy, the Sea of Monsters is the sea all heroes sail through on their
                        adventures. It
                        used to be in the Mediterranean, yes. But like everything else, it shifts locations as the
                        West’s center of
                        power shifts.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Like Mount Olympus being above the Empire State Building,” I said. “And Hades
                        being under Los
                        Angeles.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But a whole sea full of monsters—how could you hide something like that?
                        Wouldn’t the mortals
                        notice weird things happening... like, ships getting eaten and stuff ?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Of course they notice. They don’t understand, but they know something is
                        strange about that
                        part of the ocean. The Sea of Monsters is off the east coast of the U.S. now, just northeast of
                        Florida. The
                        mortals even have a name for it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Bermuda Triangle?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Exactly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I let that sink in. I guess it wasn’t stranger than anything else I’d learned
                        since coming to
                        Camp Half-Blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Okay... so at least we know where to look.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s still a huge area, Percy. Searching for one tiny island in
                        monster-infested waters—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, I’m the son of the sea god. This is my home turf. How hard can it be?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth knit her eyebrows. “We’ll have to talk to Tantalus, get approval for a
                        quest. He’ll
                        say no.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not if we tell him tonight at the campfire in front of everybody. The whole
                        camp will hear.
                        They’ll pressure him. He won’t be able to refuse.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe.” A little bit of hope crept into Annabeth’s voice. “We’d better get
                        these dishes done.
                        Hand me the lava spray gun, will you?” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">That night at the campfire, Apollo’s cabin led the sing-along. They tried to
                        get everybody’s
                        spirits up, but it wasn’t easy after that afternoon’s bird attack. We all sat around a
                        semicircle of stone
                        steps, singing halfheartedly and watching the bonfire blaze while the Apollo guys strummed their
                        guitars and
                        picked their lyres. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We did all the standard camp numbers: “Down by the Aegean,” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I Am My Own Great-Great-Great-Great-Grandpa,” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This Land is Minos’s Land.” The bonfire was enchanted, so the louder you sang,
                        the higher it
                        rose, changing color and heat with the mood of the crowd. On a good night, I’d seen it twenty
                        feet high, bright
                        purple, and so hot the whole front row’s marshmallows burst into the flames. Tonight, the fire
                        was only five
                        feet high, barely warm, and the flames were the color of lint. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Dionysus left early. After suffering through a few songs, he muttered something
                        about how even
                        pinochle with Chiron had been more exciting than this. Then he gave Tantalus a distasteful look
                        and headed back
                        toward the Big House. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When the last song was over, Tantalus said, “Well, that was lovely!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He came forward with a toasted marshmallow on a stick and tried to pluck it
                        off, real
                        casual-like. But before he could touch it, the marshmallow flew off the stick. Tantalus made a
                        wild grab, but
                        the marshmallow committed suicide, diving into the flames. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tantalus turned back toward us, smiling coldly. “Now then! Some announcements
                        about tomorrow’s
                        schedule.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sir,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tantalus’s eye twitched. “Our kitchen boy has something to say?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Some of the Ares campers snickered, but I wasn’t going to let anybody embarrass
                        me into
                        silence. I stood and looked at Annabeth. Thank the gods, she stood up with me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I said, “We have an idea to save the camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dead silence, but I could tell I’d gotten everybody’s interest, because the
                        campfire flared
                        bright yellow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Indeed,” Tantalus said blandly. “Well, if it has anything to do with
                        chariots—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Golden Fleece,” I said. “We know where it is.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The flames burned orange. Before Tantalus could stop me, I blurted out my dream
                        about Grover
                        and Polyphemus’s island. Annabeth stepped in and reminded everybody what the Fleece could do. It
                        sounded more
                        convincing coming from her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Fleece can save the camp,” she concluded. “I’m certain of it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nonsense,” said Tantalus. “We don’t need saving.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everybody stared at him until Tantalus started looking uncomfortable. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Besides,” he added quickly, “the Sea of Monsters? That’s hardly an exact
                        location. You
                        wouldn’t even know where to look.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, I would,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth leaned toward me and whispered, “You would?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I nodded, because Annabeth had jogged something in my memory when she reminded
                        me about our
                        taxi drive with the Gray Sisters. At the time, the information they’d given me made no sense.
                        But now... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“30, 31, 75, 12,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ooo-kay,” Tantalus said. “Thank you for sharing those meaningless numbers.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They’re sailing coordinates,” I said. “Latitude and longitude. I, uh, learned
                        about it in
                        social studies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Even Annabeth looked impressed. “30 degrees, 31 minutes north, 75 degrees, 12
                        minutes west.
                        He’s right! The Gray Sisters gave us those coordinates. That’d be somewhere in the Atlantic, off
                        the coast of
                        Florida. The Sea of Monsters. We need a quest!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait just a minute,” Tantalus said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But the campers took up the chant. “We need a quest! We need a quest!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The flames rose higher. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It isn’t necessary!” Tantalus insisted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“WE NEED A QUEST! WE NEED A QUEST!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Fine!” Tantalus shouted, his eyes blazing with anger. “You brats want me to
                        assign a quest?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“YES!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Very well,” he agreed. “I shall authorize a champion to undertake this
                        perilous journey, to
                        retrieve the Golden Fleece and bring it back to camp. Or die trying.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My heart filled with excitement. I wasn’t going to let Tantalus scare me. This
                        was what I
                        needed to do. I was going to save Grover and the camp. Nothing would stop me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I will allow our champion to consult the Oracle!” Tantalus announced. “And
                        choose two
                        companions for the journey. And I think the choice of champion is obvious.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tantalus looked at Annabeth and me as if he wanted to flay us alive. “The
                        champion should be
                        one who has earned the camp’s respect, who has proven resourceful in the chariot races and
                        courageous in the
                        defense of the camp. <i class="calibre5">You </i>shall lead this quest... Clarisse!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The fire flickered a thousand different colors. The Ares cabin started stomping
                        and cheering,
                        “CLARISSE! CLARISSE!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse stood up, looking stunned. Then she swallowed, and her chest swelled
                        with pride. “I
                        accept the quest!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait!” I shouted. “Grover is my friend. The dream came to <i
                            class="calibre5">me</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sit down!” yelled one of the Ares campers. “You had your chance last summer!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, he just wants to be in the spotlight again!” another said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse glared at me. “I accept the quest!” she repeated. “I, Clarisse,
                        daughter of Ares, will
                        save the camp!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Ares campers cheered even louder. Annabeth protested, and the other Athena
                        campers joined
                        in. Everybody else started taking sides—shouting and arguing and throwing marshmallows. I
                        thought it was going
                        to turn into a full-fledged s’more war until Tantalus shouted, “Silence, you brats!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His tone stunned even me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sit down!” he ordered. “And I will tell you a ghost story.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know what he was up to, but we all moved reluctantly back to our
                        seats. The evil aura
                        radiating from Tantalus was as strong as any monster I’d ever faced. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Once upon a time there was a mortal king who was beloved of the Gods!”
                        Tantalus put his hand
                        on his chest, and I got the feeling he was talking about himself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This king,” he said, “was even allowed to feast on Mount Olympus. But when he
                        tried to take
                        some ambrosia and nectar back to earth to figure out the recipe—just one little doggie bag, mind
                        you—the gods
                        punished him. They banned him from their halls forever! His own people mocked him! His children
                        scolded him!
                        And, oh yes, campers, he had horrible children. Children—just—like—you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He pointed a crooked finger at several people in the audience, including me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Do you know what he did to his ungrateful children?” Tantalus asked softly.
                        “Do you know how
                        he paid back the gods for their cruel punishment? He invited the Olympians to a feast at his
                        palace, just to
                        show there were no hard feelings. No one noticed that his children were missing. And when he
                        served the gods
                        dinner, my dear campers, can you guess what was in the stew?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">No one dared answer. The firelight glowed dark blue, reflecting evilly on
                        Tantalus’s crooked
                        face. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/7-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, the gods punished him in the afterlife,” Tantalus croaked. “They did
                        indeed. But he’d had
                        his moment of satisfaction, hadn’t he? His children never again spoke back to him or questioned
                        his authority.
                        And do you know what? Rumor has it that the king’s spirit now dwells at this very camp, waiting
                        for a chance to
                        take revenge on ungrateful, rebellious children. And so... are there any more complaints, before
                        we
                        send Clarisse
                        off on her quest?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Silence. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tantalus nodded at Clarisse. “The Oracle, my dear. Go on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She shifted uncomfortably, like even <i class="calibre5">she </i>didn’t want
                        glory at the price
                        of being Tantalus’s pet. “Sir—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Go!” he snarled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She bowed awkwardly and hurried off toward the Big House. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What about you, Percy Jackson?” Tantalus asked. “No comments from our
                        dishwasher?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t say anything. I wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of punishing
                        me again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Good,” Tantalus said. “And let me remind everyone—no one leaves this camp
                        without my
                        permission. Anyone who tries... well, if they survive the attempt, they will be expelled
                        forever,
                        but it won’t come
                        to that. The harpies will be enforcing curfew from now on, and they are always hungry! Good
                        night, my dear
                        campers. Sleep well.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">With a wave of Tantalus’s hand, the fire was extinguished, and the campers
                        trailed off toward
                        their cabins in the dark. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I couldn’t explain things to Tyson. He knew I was sad. He knew I wanted to go
                        on a trip and
                        Tantalus wouldn’t let me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You will go anyway?” he asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t know,” I admitted. “It would be hard. Very hard.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I will help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No. I—uh, I couldn’t ask you to do that, big guy. Too dangerous.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson looked down at the pieces of metal he was assembling in his lap—springs
                        and gears and
                        tiny wires. Beckendorf had given him some tools and spare parts, and now Tyson spent every night
                        tinkering,
                        though I wasn’t sure how his huge hands could handle such delicate little pieces. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What are you building?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson didn’t answer. Instead he made a whimpering sound in the back of his
                        throat. “Annabeth
                        doesn’t like Cyclopes. You... don’t want me along?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, that’s not it,” I said halfheartedly. “Annabeth likes you. Really.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He had tears in the corners of his eye. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I remembered that Grover, like all satyrs, could read human emotions. I
                        wondered if Cyclopes
                        had the same ability. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson folded up his tinkering project in an oilcloth. He lay down on his bunk
                        bed and hugged
                        his bundle like a teddy bear. When he turned toward the wall, I could see the weird scars on his
                        back, like
                        somebody had plowed over him with a tractor. I wondered for the millionth time how he’d gotten
                        hurt. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/7-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Daddy always cared for m-me,” he sniffled. “Now... I think he was mean to have
                        a
                        Cyclops boy. I
                        should not have been born.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t talk that way! Poseidon claimed you, didn’t he? So... he must care about
                        you... a lot....” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My voice trailed off as I thought about all those years Tyson had lived on the
                        streets of New
                        York in a cardboard refrigerator box. How could Tyson think that Poseidon had cared for him?
                        What kind of dad
                        let that happen to his kid, even if his kid was a monster? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson... camp will be a good home for you. The others will get used to you. I
                        promise.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson sighed. I waited for him to say something. Then I realized he was already
                        asleep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I lay back on my bed and tried to close my eyes, but I just couldn’t. I was
                        afraid I might have
                        another dream about Grover. If the empathy link was real... if something happened to Grover...
                        would I
                        ever wake up?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The full moon shone through my window. The sound of the surf rumbled in the
                        distance. I could
                        smell the warm scent of the strawberry fields, and hear the laughter of the dryads as they
                        chased owls through
                        the forest. But something felt wrong about the night—the sickness of Thalia’s tree, spreading
                        across the valley.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Could Clarisse save Half-Blood Hill? I thought the odds were better of me
                        getting a “Best
                        Camper” award from Tantalus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I got out of bed and pulled on some clothes. I grabbed a beach blanket and a
                        six-pack of Coke
                        from under my bunk. The Cokes were against the rules. No outside snacks or drinks were allowed,
                        but if you
                        talked to the right guy in Hermes’s cabin and paid him a few golden drachma, he could smuggle in
                        almost anything
                        from the nearest convenience store. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Sneaking out after curfew was against the rules, too. If I got caught I’d
                        either get in big
                        trouble or be eaten by the harpies. But I wanted to see the ocean. I always felt better there.
                        My thoughts were
                        clearer. I left the cabin and headed for the beach. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I spread my blanket near the surf and popped open a Coke. For some reason sugar
                        and caffeine
                        always calmed down my hyperactive brain. I tried to decide what to do to save the camp, but
                        nothing came to me.
                        I wished Poseidon would talk to me, give me some advice or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The sky was clear and starry. I was checking out the constellations Annabeth
                        had taught
                        me—Sagittarius, Hercules, Corona Borealis—when somebody said, “Beautiful, aren’t they?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I almost spewed soda. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Standing right next to me was a guy in nylon running shorts and a New York City
                        Marathon
                        T-shirt. He was slim and fit, with salt-and-pepper hair and a sly smile. He looked kind of
                        familiar, but I
                        couldn’t figure out why. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/7-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">My first thought was that he must’ve been taking a midnight jog down the beach
                        and strayed
                        inside the camp borders. That wasn’t supposed to happen. Regular mortals couldn’t enter the
                        valley. But maybe
                        with the tree’s magic weakening he’d managed to slip in. But in the middle of the night? And
                        there was nothing
                        around except farmland and state preserves. Where would this guy have jogged from? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“May I join you?” he asked. “I haven’t sat down in ages.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Now, I know—a strange guy in the middle of the night. Common sense: I was
                        supposed to run away,
                        yell for help, etc. But the guy acted so calm about the whole thing that I found it hard to be
                        afraid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I said, “Uh, sure.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He smiled. “Your hospitality does you credit. Oh, and Coca-Cola! May I?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He sat at the other end of the blanket, popped a soda and took a drink.
                        “Ah... that hits the spot.
                        Peace and quiet at—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A cell phone went off in his pocket. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The jogger sighed. He pulled out his phone and my eyes got big, because it
                        glowed with a bluish
                        light. When he extended the antenna, two creatures began writhing around it—green snakes, no
                        bigger than
                        earthworms. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The jogger didn’t seem to notice. He checked his LCD display and cursed. “I’ve
                        got to take
                        this. Just a sec...” Then into the phone: “Hello?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He listened. The mini-snakes writhed up and down the antenna right next to his
                        ear. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” the jogger said. “Listen—I know, but... I don’t care if he <i
                            class="calibre5">is
                        </i>chained to a rock with vultures pecking at his liver, if he doesn’t have a tracking number,

                        mind.
                        Listen, just refer
                        him to Eris in customer service. I gotta go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He hung up. “Sorry. The overnight express business is just booming. Now, as I
                        was saying—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You have snakes on your phone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What? Oh, they don’t bite. Say hello, George and Martha.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Hello, George and Martha, </i>a raspy male voice said
                        inside my head. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Why not? </i>George demanded. <i class="calibre5">I do all
                            the </i>real <i class="calibre5">work</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, let’s not go into that again!” The jogger slipped his phone back into his
                        pocket. “Now,
                        where were we... Ah, yes. Peace and quiet.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He crossed his ankles and stared up at the stars. “Been a long time since I’ve
                        gotten to relax.
                        Ever since the telegraph—rush, rush, rush. Do you have a favorite constellation, Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was still kind of wondering about the little green snakes he’d shoved into
                        his jogging
                        shorts, but I said, “Uh, I like Hercules.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well... because he had rotten luck. Even worse than mine. It makes me feel
                        better.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The jogger chuckled. “Not because he was strong and famous and all that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re an interesting young man. And so, what now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I knew immediately what he was asking. What did I intend to do about the
                        Fleece? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before I could answer, Martha the snake’s muffled voice came from his pocket:
                        <i class="calibre5">I have Demeter on line two. </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not now,” the jogger said. “Tell her to leave a message.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">She’s not going to like that. The last time you put her
                            off, all the
                            flowers in the floral delivery division wilted.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Just tell her I’m in a meeting!” The jogger rolled his eyes. “Sorry again,
                        Percy. You were
                        saying...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um... who are you, exactly?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Haven’t you guessed by now, a smart boy like you?” </p>

                            class="calibre5">She just wants to

                    <p class="calibre13">The man took out his phone again. “Original form, please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The phone glowed a brilliant blue. It stretched into a three-foot-long wooden
                        staff with dove
                        wings sprouting out the top. George and Martha, now full-sized green snakes, coiled together
                        around the middle.
                        It was a caduceus, the symbol of Cabin Eleven. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">My throat tightened. I realized who the jogger reminded me of with his elfish
                        features, the
                        mischievous twinkle in his eyes.... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re Luke’s father,” I said. “Hermes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The god pursed his lips. He stuck his caduceus in the sand like an umbrella
                        pole. “‘Luke’s
                        father.’ Normally, that’s not the first way people introduce me. God of thieves, yes. God of
                        messengers and
                        travelers, if they wish to be kind.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">God of thieves works, </i>George said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Oh, don’t mind George. </i>Martha flicked her tongue at me.
                        <i class="calibre5">He’s just bitter because Hermes likes me best. </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">He does not!</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Does too!</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Behave, you two,” Hermes warned, “or I’ll turn you back into a cell phone and
                        set you on
                        vibrate! Now, Percy, you still haven’t answered my question. What do you intend to do about the
                        quest?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I—I don’t have permission to go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, indeed. Will that stop you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I want to go. I have to save Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Hermes smiled. “I knew a boy once... oh, younger than you by far. A mere baby,
                        really.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Here we go again, </i>George said. <i
                            class="calibre5">Always talking about
                            himself. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Quiet! </i>Martha snapped. <i class="calibre5">Do you want
                            to get set on
                            vibrate? </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Hermes ignored them. “One night, when this boy’s mother wasn’t watching, he
                        sneaked out of
                        their cave and stole some cattle that belonged to Apollo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Did he get blasted to tiny pieces?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hmm... no. Actually, everything turned out quite well. To make up for his
                        theft,
                        the boy gave
                        Apollo an instrument he’d invented—a lyre. Apollo was so enchanted with the music that he forgot
                        all about being
                        angry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So what’s the moral?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The moral?” Hermes asked. “Goodness, you act like it’s a fable. It’s a true
                        story. Does truth
                        have a moral?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How about this: stealing is not always bad?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t think my mom would like that moral.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Rats are delicious</i>, suggested George. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">What does that have to do with the story? </i>Martha
                        demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Nothing, </i>George said. <i class="calibre5">But I’m
                            hungry. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ve got it,” Hermes said. “Young people don’t always do what they’re told,
                        but if they can
                        pull it off and do something wonderful, sometimes they escape punishment. How’s that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re saying I should go anyway,” I said, “even without permission.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Hermes’s eyes twinkled. “Martha, may I have the first package, please?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Martha opened her mouth... and kept opening it until it was as wide as my arm.
                        She
                        belched out a
                        stainless steel canister—an old-fashioned lunch box thermos with a black plastic top. The sides
                        of the thermos
                        were enameled with red and yellow Ancient Greek scenes—a hero killing a lion; a hero lifting up
                        Cerberus, the
                        three-headed dog. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s Hercules,” I said. “But how—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Never question a gift,” Hermes chided. “This is a collector’s item from <i
                            class="calibre5">Hercules Busts Heads</i>. The first season.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Hercules Busts Heads</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Great show.” Hermes sighed. “Back before Hephaestus-TV was all reality
                        programming. Of course,
                        the thermos would be worth much more if I had the whole lunch box—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Or if it hadn’t been in Martha’s mouth, </i>George added.
                        <i class="calibre5">I’ll get you for that</i>. Martha began chasing him around the caduceus.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait a minute,” I said. “This is a gift?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“One of two,” Hermes said. “Go on, pick it up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I almost dropped it because it was freezing cold on one side and burning hot on
                        the other. The
                        weird thing was, when I turned the thermos, the side facing the ocean—north—was always the cold
                        side.... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s a compass!” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Hermes looked surprised. “Very clever. I never thought of that. But its
                        intended use is a bit
                        more dramatic. Uncap it, and you will release the winds from the four corners of the earth to
                        speed you on your
                        way. Not now! And please, when the time comes, only unscrew the lid a tiny bit. The winds are a
                        bit like
                        me—always restless. Should all four escape at once... ah, but I’m sure you’ll be careful. And
                        now
                        my second gift.
                        George?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">She’s touching me</i>, George complained as he and Martha
                        slithered around
                        the pole. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“She’s <i class="calibre5">always </i>touching you,” Hermes said. “You’re
                        intertwined. And if
                        you don’t stop that, you’ll get knotted again!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The snakes stopped wrestling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">George unhinged his jaw and coughed up a little plastic bottle filled with
                        chewable vitamins.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re kidding,” I said. “Are those Minotaur-shaped?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Hermes picked up the bottle and rattled it. “The lemon ones, yes. The grape
                        ones are Furies, I
                        think. Or are they hydras? At any rate, these are potent. Don’t take one unless you really,
                        really need it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How will I know if I really, really need it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’ll know, believe me. Nine essential vitamins, minerals, amino acids... oh,
                        everything you
                        need to feel yourself again.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He tossed me the bottle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, thanks,” I said. “But Lord Hermes, why are you helping me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He gave me a melancholy smile. “Perhaps because I hope that you can save many
                        people on this
                        quest, Percy. Not just your friend Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at him. “You don’t mean... <i class="calibre5">Luke</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Hermes didn’t answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Look,” I said. “Lord Hermes, I mean, thanks and everything, but you might as
                        well take back
                        your gifts. Luke can’t be saved. Even if I could find him... he told me he wanted to tear down
                        Olympus stone by
                        stone. He betrayed everybody he knew. He—he hates you especially.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Hermes gazed up at the stars. “My dear young cousin, if there’s one thing I’ve
                        learned over the
                        eons, it’s that you <i class="calibre5">can’t </i>give up on your family, no matter how tempting
                        they make it.
                        It doesn’t matter if they hate you, or embarrass you, or simply don’t appreciate your genius for
                        inventing the
                        Internet—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You invented the Internet?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">It was my idea</i>, Martha said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Rats are delicious</i>, George said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It was <i class="calibre5">my </i>idea!” Hermes said. “I mean the Internet,
                        not the rats. But
                        that’s not the point. Percy, do you understand what I’m saying about family?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I—I’m not sure.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You will some day.” Hermes got up and brushed the sand off his legs. “In the
                        meantime, I must
                        be going.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">You have sixty calls to return</i>, Martha said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">And one thousand-thirty-eight e-mails</i>, George added. <i
                            class="calibre5">Not counting the offers for online discount ambrosia</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And you, Percy,” Hermes said, “have a shorter deadline than you realize to
                        complete your
                        quest. Your friends should be coming right about... now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I heard Annabeth’s voice calling my name from the sand dunes. Tyson, too, was
                        shouting from a
                        little bit farther away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I hope I packed well for you,” Hermes said. “I do have some experience with
                        travel.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He snapped his fingers and three yellow duffel bags appeared at my feet.
                        “Waterproof, of
                        course. If you ask nicely, your father should be able to help you reach the ship.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ship?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Hermes pointed. Sure enough, a big cruise ship was cutting across Long Island
                        Sound, its
                        white-and-gold lights glowing against the dark water. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait,” I said. “I don’t understand any of this. I haven’t even agreed to go!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’d make up your mind in the next five minutes, if I were you,” Hermes
                        advised. “That’s when
                        the harpies will come to eat you. Now, good night, cousin, and dare I say it? May the gods go
                        with you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He opened his hand and the caduceus flew into it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Good luck</i>, Martha told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Bring me back a rat</i>, George said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The caduceus changed into a cell phone and Hermes slipped it into his pocket.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He jogged off down the beach. Twenty paces away, he shimmered and vanished,
                        leaving me alone
                        with a thermos, a bottle of chewable vitamins, and five minutes to make an impossible decision.

                        and the bottle
                        of vitamins I was holding. “What—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Just listen,” I said. “We don’t have much time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I told them about my conversation with Hermes. By the time I was finished, I
                        could hear
                        screeching in the distance—patrol harpies picking up our scent. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” Annabeth said, “we have to do the quest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll get expelled, you know. Trust me, I’m an expert at getting expelled.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So? If we fail, there won’t be any camp to come back to.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, but you promised Chiron—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I promised I’d keep you from danger. I can only do that by coming with you!
                        Tyson can stay
                        behind and tell them—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I want to go,” Tyson said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Annabeth’s voice sounded close to panic. “I mean... Percy, come on. You
                        know
                        that’s
                        impossible.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wondered again why she had such a grudge against Cyclopes. There was
                        something she wasn’t
                        telling me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She and Tyson both looked at me, waiting for an answer. Meanwhile, the cruise
                        ship was getting
                        farther and farther away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The thing was, part of me didn’t want Tyson along. I’d spent the last three
                        days in close
                        quarters with the guy, getting razzed by the other campers and embarrassed a million times a
                        day, constantly
                        reminded that I was related to him. I needed some space. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Plus, I didn’t know how much help he’d be, or how I’d keep him safe. Sure, he
                        was strong, but
                        Tyson was a little kid in Cyclops terms, maybe seven or eight years old, mentally. I could see
                        him freaking out
                        and starting to cry while we were trying to sneak past a monster or something. He’d get us all
                        killed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">On the other hand, the sound of the harpies was getting closer.... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We can’t leave him,” I decided. “Tantalus will punish him for us being gone.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” Annabeth said, trying to keep her cool, “we’re going to Polyphemus’s
                        island!
                        Polyphemus is an S-i-k... a C-y-k...” She stamped her foot in frustration. As smart as she was,
                        Annabeth was
                        dyslexic, too. We could’ve been there all night while she tried to spell Cyclops. “You know what
                        I mean!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson can go,” I insisted, “if he wants to.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson clapped his hands. “Want to!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth gave me the evil eye, but I guess she could tell I wasn’t going to
                        change my mind. Or
                        maybe she just knew we didn’t have time to argue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right,” she said. “How do we get to that ship?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hermes said my father would help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well then, Seaweed Brain? What are you waiting for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I’d always had a hard time calling on my father, or praying, or whatever you
                        want to call it,
                        but I stepped into the waves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, Dad?” I called. “How’s it going?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Annabeth whispered. “We’re in a hurry!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We need your help,” I called a little louder. “We need to get to that ship,
                        like, before we
                        get eaten and stuff, so...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">At first, nothing happened. Waves crashed against the shore like normal. The
                        harpies sounded
                        like they were right behind the sand dunes. Then, about a hundred yards out to sea, three white
                        lines appeared
                        on the surface. They moved fast toward the shore, like claws ripping through the ocean. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As they neared the beach, the surf burst apart and the heads of three white
                        stallions reared
                        out of the waves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson caught his breath. “Fish ponies!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He was right. As the creatures pulled themselves onto the sand, I saw that they
                        were only
                        horses in the front; their back halves were silvery fish bodies, with glistening scales and
                        rainbow tail fins.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hippocampi!” Annabeth said. “They’re beautiful.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The nearest one whinnied in appreciation and nuzzled Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll admire them later,” I said. “Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There!” a voice screeched behind us. “Bad children out of cabins! Snack time
                        for lucky
                        harpies!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Five of them were fluttering over the top of the dunes—plump little hags with
                        pinched faces and
                        talons and feathery wings too small for their bodies. They reminded me of miniature cafeteria
                        ladies who’d been
                        crossbred with dodo birds. They weren’t very fast, thank the gods, but they were vicious if they
                        caught you.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” I said. “Grab a duffel bag!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He was still staring at the hippocampi with his mouth hanging open. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">With Annabeth’s help I got him moving. We gathered the bags and mounted our
                        steeds. Poseidon
                        must’ve known Tyson was one of the passengers, because one hippocampus was much larger than the
                        other two—just
                        right for carrying a Cyclops. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Giddyup!” I said. My hippocampus turned and plunged into the waves. Annabeth’s
                        and Tyson’s
                        followed right behind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The harpies cursed at us, wailing for their snacks to come back, but the
                        hippocampi raced over
                        the water at the speed of Jet Skis. The harpies fell behind, and soon the shore of Camp
                        Half-Blood was nothing
                        but a dark smudge. I wondered if I’d ever see the place again. But right then I had other
                        problems. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The cruise ship was now looming in front of us—our ride toward Florida and the
                        Sea of Monsters.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Riding the hippocampus was even easier than riding a pegasus. We zipped along
                        with the wind in
                        our faces, speeding through the waves so smooth and steady I hardly needed to hold on at all.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As we got closer to the cruise ship, I realized just how huge it was. I felt as
                        though I were
                        looking up at a building in Manhattan. The white hull was at least ten stories tall, topped with
                        another dozen
                        levels of decks with brightly lit balconies and portholes. The ship’s name was painted just
                        above the bow line
                        in black letters, lit with a spotlight. It took me a few seconds to decipher it: </p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="center"><i class="calibre5"><small class="calibre4">PRINCESS ANDROMEDA</small></i> </p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Attached to the bow was a huge masthead—a three story-tall woman wearing a
                        white Greek chiton,
                        sculpted to look as if she were chained to the front of the ship. She was young and beautiful,
                        with flowing
                        black hair, but her expression was one of absolute terror. Why anybody would want a screaming
                        princess on the
                        front of their vacation ship, I had no idea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I remembered the myth about Andromeda and how she had been chained to a rock by
                        her own parents
                        as a sacrifice to a sea monster. Maybe she’d gotten too many F’s on her report card or
                        something. Anyway, my
                        namesake, Perseus, had saved her just in time and turned the sea monster to stone using the head
                        of Medusa. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">That </i>Perseus always won. That’s why my mom had named me
                        after him, even
                        though he was a son of Zeus and I was a son of Poseidon. The original Perseus was one of the
                        only heroes in the
                        Greek myths who got a happy ending. The others died—betrayed, mauled, mutilated, poisoned, or
                        cursed by the
                        gods. My mom hoped I would inherit Perseus’s luck. Judging by how my life was going so far, I
                        wasn’t real
                        optimistic. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How do we get aboard?” Annabeth shouted over the noise of the waves, but the
                        hippocampi seemed
                        to know what we needed. They skimmed along the starboard side of the ship, riding easily through
                        its huge wake,
                        and pulled up next to a service ladder riveted to the side of the hull. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You first,” I told Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She slung her duffel bag over her shoulder and grabbed the bottom rung. Once
                        she’d hoisted
                        herself onto the ladder, her hippocampus whinnied a farewell and dove underwater. Annabeth began
                        to climb. I let
                        her get a few rungs up, then followed her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally it was just Tyson in the water. His hippocampus was treating him to
                        360º aerials and
                        backward ollies, and Tyson was laughing so hysterically, the sound echoed up the side of the
                        ship. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson, shhh!” I said. “Come on, big guy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Can’t we take Rainbow?” he asked, his smile fading. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at him. “<i class="calibre5">Rainbow?</i>” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The hippocampus whinnied as if he liked his new name. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, we have to go,” I said. “Rainbow... well, he can’t climb ladders.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson sniffled. He buried his face in the hippocampus’s mane. “I will miss you,
                        Rainbow!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The hippocampus made a neighing sound I could’ve sworn was crying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Maybe we’ll see him again sometime,” I suggested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, please!” Tyson said, perking up immediately. “Tomorrow!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t make any promises, but I finally convinced Tyson to say his farewells
                        and grab hold of
                        the ladder. With a final sad whinny, Rainbow the hippocampus did a back-flip and dove into the
                        sea. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/8-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The ladder led to a maintenance deck stacked with yellow lifeboats. There was a
                        set of locked
                        double doors, which Annabeth managed to pry open with her knife and a fair amount of cursing in
                        Ancient Greek.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I figured we’d have to sneak around, being stowaways and all, but after
                        checking a few
                        corridors and peering over a balcony into a huge central promenade lined with closed shops, I
                        began to realize
                        there was nobody to hide from. I mean, sure it was the middle of the night, but we walked half
                        the length of the
                        boat and met no one. We passed forty or fifty cabin doors and heard no sound behind any of them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s a ghost ship,” I murmured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” Tyson said, fiddling with the strap of his duffel bag. “Bad smell.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth frowned. “I don’t smell anything.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cyclopes are like satyrs,” I said. “They can smell monsters. Isn’t that right,
                        Tyson?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He nodded nervously. Now that we were away from Camp Half-Blood, the Mist had
                        distorted his
                        face again. Unless I concentrated very hard, it seemed that he had two eyes instead of one. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Okay,” Annabeth said. “So what exactly do you smell?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Something bad,” Tyson answered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Great,” Annabeth grumbled. “That clears it up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We came outside on the swimming pool level. There were rows of empty deck
                        chairs and a bar
                        closed off with a chain curtain. The water in the pool glowed eerily, sloshing back and forth
                        from the motion of
                        the ship. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Above us fore and aft were more levels—a climbing wall, a putt-putt golf
                        course, a revolving
                        restaurant, but no sign of life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And yet... I sensed something familiar. Something dangerous. I had the feeling
                        that if I weren’t
                        so tired and burned out on adrenaline from our long night, I might be able to put a name to what
                        was wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We need a hiding place,” I said. “Somewhere safe to sleep.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sleep,” Annabeth agreed wearily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We explored a few more corridors until we found an empty suite on the ninth
                        level. The door was
                        open, which struck me as weird. There was a basket of chocolate goodies on the table, an
                        iced-down bottle of
                        sparkling cider on the nightstand, and a mint on the pillow with a handwritten note that said:
                        <i class="calibre5">Enjoy your cruise! </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We opened our duffel bags for the first time and found that Hermes really had
                        thought of
                        everything—extra clothes, toiletries, camp rations, a Ziploc bag full of cash, a leather pouch
                        full of golden
                        drachmas. He’d even managed to pack Tyson’s oilcloth with his tools and metal bits, and
                        Annabeth’s cap of
                        invisibility, which made them both feel a lot better. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll be next door,” Annabeth said. “You guys <i class="calibre5">don’t
                        </i>drink or eat
                        anything.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You think this place is enchanted?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She frowned. “I don’t know. Something isn’t right. Just... be careful.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We locked our doors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson crashed on the couch. He tinkered for a few minutes on his metalworking
                        project—which he
                        still wouldn’t show me—but soon enough he was yawning. He wrapped up his oilcloth and passed
                        out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I lay on the bed and stared out the porthole. I thought I heard voices out in
                        the hallway, like
                        whispering. I knew that couldn’t be. We’d walked all over the ship and had seen nobody. But the
                        voices kept me
                        awake. They reminded me of my trip to the Underworld—the way the spirits of the dead sounded as
                        they drifted
                        past. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally my weariness got the best of me. I fell asleep... and had my worst
                        dream
                        yet. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I was standing in a cavern at the edge of an enormous pit. I knew the place too
                        well. The
                        entrance to Tartarus. And I recognized the cold laugh that echoed from the darkness below. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">If it isn’t the young hero. </i>The voice was like a knife
                        blade scraping
                        across stone. <i class="calibre5">On his way to another great victory. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to shout at Kronos to leave me alone. I wanted to draw Riptide and
                        strike him down.
                        But I couldn’t move. And even if I could, how could I kill something that had already been
                        destroyed—chopped to
                        pieces and cast into eternal darkness? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Don’t let me stop you, </i>the titan said. <i
                            class="calibre5">Perhaps this
                            time, when you fail, you’ll wonder if it’s worthwhile slaving for the gods. How exactly

                    <p class="calibre13">His laughter filled the cavern, and suddenly the scene changed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was a different cave—Grover’s bedroom prison in the Cyclops’s lair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover was sitting at the loom in his soiled wedding dress, madly unraveling
                        the threads of the
                        unfinished bridal train. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Honeypie!” the monster shouted from behind the boulder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover yelped and began weaving the threads back together. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The room shook as the boulder was pushed aside. Looming in the doorway was a
                        Cyclops so huge he
                        made Tyson look vertically challenged. He had jagged yellow teeth and gnarled hands as big as my
                        whole body. He
                        wore a faded purple T-shirt that said <small class="calibre4">WORLD SHEEP EXPO 2001</small>. He
                        must’ve been at
                        least fifteen feet tall, but the most startling thing was his enormous milky eye, scarred and
                        webbed with
                        cataracts. If he wasn’t completely blind, he had to be pretty darn close. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/8-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“What are you doing?” the monster demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nothing!” Grover said in his falsetto voice. “Just weaving my bridal train, as
                        you can see.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Cyclops stuck one hand into the room and groped around until he found the
                        loom. He pawed at
                        the cloth. “It hasn’t gotten any longer!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, um, yes it has, dearest. See? I’ve added at least an inch.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Too many delays!” the monster bellowed. Then he sniffed the air. “You smell
                        good! Like goats!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh.” Grover forced a weak giggle. “Do you like it? It’s <i
                            class="calibre5">Eau de Chévre</i>.
                        I wore it just for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mmmm!” The Cyclops bared his pointed teeth. “Good enough to eat!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, you’re such a flirt!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No more delays!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But dear, I’m not done!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tomorrow!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no. Ten more days.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Five!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, well, seven then. If you insist.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Seven! That is less than five, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Certainly. Oh yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The monster grumbled, still not happy with his deal, but he left Grover to his
                        weaving and
                        rolled the boulder back into place. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover closed his eyes and took a shaky breath, trying to calm his nerves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hurry, Percy,” he muttered. “Please, please, please!”</p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I woke to a ship’s whistle and a voice on the intercom—some guy with an
                        Australian accent who
                        sounded way too happy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Good morning, passengers! We’ll be at sea all day today. Excellent weather for
                        the poolside
                        mambo party! Don’t forget million-dollar bingo in the Kraken Lounge at one o’clock, and for our
                        <i class="calibre5">special guests</i>, disemboweling practice on the Promenade!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sat up in bed. “What did he say?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson groaned, still half asleep. He was lying facedown on the couch, his feet
                        so far over the
                        edge they were in the bathroom. “The happy man said... bowling practice?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hoped he was right, but then there was an urgent knock on the suite’s
                        interior door. Annabeth
                        stuck her head in—her blond hair in a rat’s nest. “<i class="calibre5">Disemboweling
                        </i>practice?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Once we were all dressed, we ventured out into the ship and were surprised to
                        see other people.
                        A dozen senior citizens were heading to breakfast. A dad was taking his kids to the pool for a
                        morning swim.
                        Crew members in crisp white uniforms strolled the deck, tipping their hats to the passengers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nobody asked who we were. Nobody paid us much attention. But there was
                        something wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As the family of swimmers passed us, the dad told his kids: “We are on a
                        cruise. We are having
                        fun.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes,” his three kids said in unison, their expressions blank. “We are having a
                        blast. We will
                        swim in the pool.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They wandered off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Good morning,” a crew member told us, his eyes glazed. “We are all enjoying
                        ourselves aboard
                        the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>. Have a nice day.” He drifted away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, this is weird,” Annabeth whispered. “They’re all in some kind of
                        trance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then we passed a cafeteria and saw our first monster. It was a hellhound—a
                        black mastiff with
                        its front paws up on the buffet line and its muzzle buried in the scrambled eggs. It must’ve
                        been young, because
                        it was small compared to most—no bigger than a grizzly bear. Still, my blood turned cold. I’d
                        almost gotten
                        killed by one of those before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The weird thing was: a middle-aged couple was standing in the buffet line right
                        behind the
                        devil dog, patiently waiting their turn for the eggs. They didn’t seem to notice anything out of
                        the ordinary.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not hungry anymore,” Tyson murmured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before Annabeth or I could reply, a reptilian voice came from down the
                        corridor, “Ssssix more
                        joined yesssterday.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth gestured frantically toward the nearest hiding place—the women’s
                        room—and all three of
                        us ducked inside. I was so freaked out it didn’t even occur to me to be embarrassed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Something—or more like <i class="calibre5">two </i>somethings—slithered past
                        the bathroom door,
                        making sounds like sandpaper against the carpet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yesss,” a second reptilian voice said. “He drawssss them. Ssssoon we will be
                        sssstrong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The things slithered into the cafeteria with a cold hissing that might have
                        been snake
                        laughter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth looked at me. “We have to get out of here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You think I <i class="calibre5">want </i>to be in the girls’ restroom?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I mean the ship, Percy! We have to get off the ship.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Smells bad,” Tyson agreed. “And dogs eat all the eggs. Annabeth is right. We
                        must leave the
                        restroom and ship.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I shuddered. If Annabeth and Tyson were actually <i
                            class="calibre5">agree</i><i class="calibre5">ing </i>about something, I figured I’d better
                        listen. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I heard another voice outside—one that chilled me worse than any
                        monster’s. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“—only a matter of time. Don’t push me, Agrius!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was Luke, beyond a doubt. I could never forget his voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m not pushing you!” another guy growled. His voice was deeper and even
                        angrier than Luke’s.
                        “I’m just saying, if this gamble doesn’t pay off—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’ll pay off,” Luke snapped. “They’ll take the bait. Now, come, we’ve got to
                        get to the
                        admiralty suite and check on the casket.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Their voices receded down the corridor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson whimpered. “Leave now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and I exchanged looks and came to a silent agreement. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We can’t,” I told Tyson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We have to find out what Luke is up to,” Annabeth agreed. “And if possible,
                        we’re going to
                        beat him up, bind him in chains, and drag him to Mount Olympus.” </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">Annabeth volunteered to go alone since she had the cap of invisibility, but I
                        convinced her it
                        was too dangerous. Either we all went together, or nobody went. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nobody!” Tyson voted. “Please?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But in the end he came along, nervously chewing on his huge fingernails. We
                        stopped at our
                        cabin long enough to gather our stuff. We figured whatever happened, we would <i
                            class="calibre5">not </i>be
                        staying another night aboard the zombie cruise ship, even if they did have million-dollar bingo.
                        I made sure
                        Riptide was in my pocket and the vitamins and thermos from Hermes were at the top of my bag. I
                        didn’t want Tyson
                        to carry everything, but he insisted, and Annabeth told me not to worry about it. Tyson could
                        carry three full
                        duffel bags over his shoulder as easily as I could carry a backpack. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We sneaked through the corridors, following the ship’s <small
                            class="calibre4">YOU ARE
                            HERE</small> signs toward the admiralty suite. Annabeth scouted ahead invisibly. We hid
                        whenever someone
                        passed by, but most of the people we saw were just glassy-eyed zombie passengers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As we came up the stairs to deck thirteen, where the admiralty suite was
                        supposed to be,
                        Annabeth hissed, </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hide!” and shoved us into a supply closet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I heard a couple of guys coming down the hall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You see that Aethiopian drakon in the cargo hold?” one of them said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The other laughed. “Yeah, it’s awesome.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth was still invisible, but she squeezed my arm hard. I got a feeling I
                        should know that
                        second guy’s voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I hear they got two more coming,” the familiar voice said. “They keep arriving
                        at this rate,
                        oh, man—no contest!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The voices faded down the corridor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That was Chris Rodriguez!” Annabeth took off her cap and turned visible. “You
                        remember—from
                        Cabin Eleven.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sort of recalled Chris from the summer before. He was one of those
                        undetermined campers who
                        got stuck in the Hermes cabin because his Olympian dad or mom never claimed him. Now that I
                        thought about it, I
                        realized I hadn’t seen Chris at camp this summer. “What’s another half-blood doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth shook her head, clearly troubled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We kept going down the corridor. I didn’t need maps anymore to know I was
                        getting close to
                        Luke. I sensed something cold and unpleasant—the presence of evil. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy.” Annabeth stopped suddenly. “Look.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She stood in front of a glass wall looking down into the multistory canyon that
                        ran through the
                        middle of the ship. At the bottom was the Promenade—a mall full of shops—but that’s not what had
                        caught
                        Annabeth’s attention. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A group of monsters had assembled in front of the candy store: a dozen
                        Laistrygonian giants
                        like the ones who’d attacked me with dodge balls, two hellhounds, and a few even stranger
                        creatures—humanoid
                        females with twin serpent tails instead of legs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Scythian Dracaenae,” Annabeth whispered. “Dragon women.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The monsters made a semicircle around a young guy in Greek armor who was
                        hacking on a straw
                        dummy. A lump formed in my throat when I realized the dummy was wearing an orange Camp
                        Half-Blood T-shirt. As we
                        watched, the guy in armor stabbed the dummy through its belly and ripped upward. Straw flew
                        everywhere. The
                        monsters cheered and howled. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/9-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth stepped away from the window. Her face was ashen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come on,” I told her, trying to sound braver than I felt. “The sooner we find
                        Luke the
                        better.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">At the end of the hallway were double oak doors that looked like they must lead
                        somewhere
                        important. When we were thirty feet away, Tyson stopped. “Voices inside.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You can hear that far?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson closed his eye like he was concentrating hard. Then his voice changed,
                        becoming a husky
                        approximation of Luke’s. “—the prophecy ourselves. The fools won’t know which way to turn.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before I could react, Tyson’s voice changed again, becoming deeper and gruffer,
                        like the other
                        guy we’d heard talking to Luke outside the cafeteria. “You really think the old horseman is gone
                        for good?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson laughed Luke’s laugh. “They can’t trust him. Not with the skeletons in <i
                            class="calibre5">his </i>closet. The poisoning of the tree was the final straw.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth shivered. “Stop that, Tyson! How do you do that? It’s creepy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson opened his eye and looked puzzled. “Just listening.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Keep going,” I said. “What else are they saying?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson closed his eye again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He hissed in the gruff man’s voice: “Quiet!” Then Luke’s voice, whispering:
                        “Are you sure?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes,” Tyson said in the gruff voice. “Right outside.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Too late, I realized what was happening. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I just had time to say, “Run!” when the doors of the stateroom burst open and
                        there was Luke,
                        flanked by two hairy giants armed with javelins, their bronze tips aimed right at our chests.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well,” Luke said with a crooked smile. “If it isn’t my two favorite cousins.
                        Come right in.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The stateroom was beautiful, and it was horrible. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The beautiful part: Huge windows curved along the back wall, looking out over
                        the stern of the
                        ship. Green sea and blue sky stretched all the way to the horizon. A Persian rug covered the
                        floor. Two plush
                        sofas occupied the middle of the room, with a canopied bed in one corner and a mahogany dining
                        table in the
                        other. The table was loaded with food—pizza boxes, bottles of soda, and a stack of roast beef
                        sandwiches on a
                        silver platter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The horrible part: On a velvet dais at the back of the room lay a ten-foot-long
                        golden casket.
                        A sarcophagus, engraved with Ancient Greek scenes of cities in flames and heroes dying grisly
                        deaths. Despite
                        the sunlight streaming through the windows, the casket made the whole room feel cold. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well,” Luke said, spreading his arms proudly. “A little nicer than Cabin
                        Eleven, huh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He’d changed since the last summer. Instead of Bermuda shorts and a T-shirt, he
                        wore a
                        button-down shirt, khaki pants, and leather loafers. His sandy hair, which used to be so unruly,
                        was now clipped
                        short. He looked like an evil male model, showing off what the fashionable college-age villain
                        was wearing to
                        Harvard this year. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/9-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">He still had the scar under his eye—a jagged white line from his battle with a
                        dragon. And
                        propped against the sofa was his magical sword, Backbiter, glinting strangely with its
                        half-steel,
                        half-Celestial bronze blade that could kill both mortals and monsters. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sit,” he told us. He waved his hand and three dining chairs scooted themselves
                        into the center
                        of the room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">None of us sat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke’s large friends were still pointing their javelins at us. They looked like
                        twins, but they
                        weren’t human. They stood about eight feet tall, for one thing, and wore only blue jeans,
                        probably because their
                        enormous chests were already shag-carpeted with thick brown fur. They had claws for fingernails,
                        feet like paws.
                        Their noses were snoutlike, and their teeth were all pointed canines. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/9-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Where are my manners?” Luke said smoothly. “These are my assistants, Agrius
                        and Oreius.
                        Perhaps you’ve heard of them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I said nothing. Despite the javelins pointed at me, it wasn’t the bear twins
                        who scared me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I’d imagined meeting Luke again many times since he’d tried to kill me last
                        summer. I’d
                        pictured myself boldly standing up to him, challenging him to a duel. But now that we were
                        face-to-face, I could
                        barely stop my hands from shaking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You don’t know Agrius and Oreius’s story?” Luke asked. “Their mother... well,
                        it’s sad, really.
                        Aphrodite ordered the young woman to fall in love. She refused and ran to Artemis for help.
                        Artemis let her
                        become one of her maiden huntresses, but Aphrodite got her revenge. She bewitched the young
                        woman into falling
                        in love with a bear. When Artemis found out, she abandoned the girl in disgust. Typical of the
                        gods, wouldn’t
                        you say? They fight with one another and the poor humans get caught in the middle. The girl’s
                        twin sons here,
                        Agrius and Oreius, have no love for Olympus. They like half-bloods well enough, though...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“For lunch,” Agrius growled. His gruff voice was the one I’d heard talking with
                        Luke earlier.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hehe! Hehe!” His brother Oreius laughed, licking his fur-lined lips. He kept
                        laughing like he
                        was having an asthmatic fit until Luke and Agrius both stared at him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Shut up, you idiot!” Agrius growled. “Go punish yourself!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Oreius whimpered. He trudged over to the corner of the room, slumped onto a
                        stool, and banged
                        his forehead against the dining table, making the silver plates rattle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke acted like this was perfectly normal behavior. He made himself comfortable
                        on the sofa and
                        propped his feet up on the coffee table. “Well, Percy, we let you survive another year. I hope
                        you appreciated
                        it. How’s your mom? How’s school?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You poisoned Thalia’s tree.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke sighed. “Right to the point, eh? Okay, sure I poisoned the tree. So what?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How could you?” Annabeth sounded so angry I thought she’d explode. “Thalia
                        saved your life! <i class="calibre5">Our </i>lives! How could you dishonor her—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I didn’t dishonor her!” Luke snapped. “The gods dishonored her, Annabeth! If
                        Thalia were
                        alive, she’d be on my side.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Liar!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“If you knew what was coming, you’d understand—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I understand you want to destroy the camp!” she yelled. “You’re a monster!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke shook his head. “The gods have blinded you. Can’t you imagine a world
                        without them,
                        Annabeth? What good is that ancient history you study? Three thousand years of baggage! The West
                        is rotten to
                        the core. It has to be destroyed. Join me! We can start the world anew. We could use your
                        intelligence,
                        Annabeth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Because you have none of your own!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His eyes narrowed. “I know you, Annabeth. You deserve better than tagging along
                        on some
                        hopeless quest to save the camp. Half-Blood Hill will be overrun by monsters within the month.
                        The heroes who
                        survive will have no choice but to join us or be hunted to extinction. You really want to be on
                        a losing
                        team... with company like this?” Luke pointed at Tyson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Traveling with a <i class="calibre5">Cyclops</i>,” Luke chided. “Talk about
                        dishonoring
                        Thalia’s memory! I’m surprised at you, Annabeth. You of all people—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stop it!” she shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know what Luke was talking about, but Annabeth buried her head in her
                        hands like she
                        was about to cry. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Leave her alone,” I said. “And leave Tyson out of this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke laughed. “Oh, yeah, I heard. Your father claimed him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I must have looked surprised, because Luke smiled. “Yes, Percy, I know all
                        about that. And
                        about your plan to find the Fleece. What were those coordinates, again... 30, 31, 75, 12? You
                        see,
                        I still have
                        friends at camp who keep me posted.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Spies, you mean.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He shrugged. “How many insults from your father can you stand, Percy? You think
                        he’s grateful
                        to you? You think Poseidon cares for you any more than he cares for this monster?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson clenched his fists and made a rumbling sound down in his throat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke just chuckled. “The gods are <i class="calibre5">so </i>using you, Percy.
                        Do you have any
                        idea what’s in store for you if you reach your sixteenth birthday? Has Chiron even <i
                            class="calibre5">told
                        </i>you the prophecy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to get in Luke’s face and tell him off, but as usual, he knew just how
                        to throw me off
                        balance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Sixteenth birthday? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I mean, I knew Chiron had received a prophecy from the Oracle many years ago. I
                        knew part of it
                        was about me. But, <i class="calibre5">if </i>I reached my sixteenth birthday? I didn’t like the
                        sound of that.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know what I need to know,” I managed. “Like, who my enemies are.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then you’re a fool.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson smashed the nearest dining chair to splinters. “Percy is not a fool!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before I could stop him, he charged Luke. His fists came down toward Luke’s
                        head—a double
                        overhead blow that would’ve knocked a hole in titanium—but the bear twins intercepted. They each
                        caught one of
                        Tyson’s arms and stopped him cold. They pushed him back and Tyson stumbled. He fell to the
                        carpet so hard the
                        deck shook. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Too bad, Cyclops,” Luke said. “Looks like my grizzly friends together are more
                        than a match
                        for your strength. Maybe I should let them—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Luke,” I cut in. “Listen to me. Your father sent us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His face turned the color of pepperoni. “Don’t—<i
                            class="calibre5">even</i>—mention him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He told us to take this boat. I thought it was just for a ride, but he sent us
                        here to find
                        you. He told me he won’t give up on you, no matter how angry you are.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Angry?</i>” Luke roared. “<i class="calibre5">Give up on
                            me? </i>He
                        abandoned me, Percy! I want Olympus destroyed! Every throne crushed to rubble! You tell Hermes
                        it’s going to
                        happen, too. Each time a half-blood joins us, the Olympians grow weaker and we grow stronger. <i
                            class="calibre5">He </i>grows stronger.” Luke pointed to the gold sarcophagus. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/9-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The box creeped me out, but I was determined not to show it. “So?” I demanded.
                        “What’s so
                        special...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then it hit me, what might be inside the sarcophagus. The temperature in the
                        room seemed to
                        drop twenty degrees. “Whoa, you don’t mean—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He is re-forming,” Luke said. “Little by little, we’re calling his life force
                        out of the pit.
                        With every recruit who pledges our cause, another small piece appears—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s disgusting!” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke sneered at her. “Your mother was born from Zeus’s split skull, Annabeth. I
                        wouldn’t talk.
                        Soon there will be enough of the titan lord so that we can make him whole again. We will piece
                        together a new
                        body for him, a work worthy of the forges of Hephaestus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re insane,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Join us and you’ll be rewarded. We have powerful friends, sponsors rich enough
                        to buy this
                        cruise ship and much more. Percy, your mother will never have to work again. You can buy her a
                        mansion. You can
                        have power, fame—whatever you want. Annabeth, you can realize your dream of being an architect.
                        You can build a
                        monument to last a thousand years. A temple to the lords of the next age!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Go to Tartarus,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke sighed. “A shame.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He picked up something that looked like a TV remote and pressed a red button.
                        Within seconds
                        the door of the stateroom opened and two uniformed crew members came in, armed with nightsticks.
                        They had the
                        same glassy-eyed look as the other mortals I’d seen, but I had a feeling this wouldn’t make them
                        any less
                        dangerous in a fight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah, good, security,” Luke said, “I’m afraid we have some stowaways.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, sir,” they said dreamily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke turned to Oreius. “It’s time to feed the Aethiopian drakon. Take these
                        fools below and
                        show them how it’s done.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Oreius grinned stupidly. “Hehe! Hehe!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Let me go, too,” Agrius grumbled. “My brother is worthless. That Cyclops—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Is no threat,” Luke said. He glanced back at the golden casket, as if
                        something were troubling
                        him. “Agrius, stay here. We have important matters to discuss.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oreius, don’t fail me. Stay in the hold to make sure the drakon is properly
                        fed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Oreius prodded us with his javelin and herded us out of the stateroom, followed
                        by the two
                        human security guards. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">As I walked down the corridor with Orieus’s javelin poking me in the back, I
                        thought about what
                        Luke had said—that the bear twins <i class="calibre5">together </i>were a match for Tyson’s
                        strength. But maybe
                        separately... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We exited the corridor amidships and walked across an open deck lined with
                        lifeboats. I knew
                        the ship well enough to realize this would be our last look at sunlight. Once we got to the
                        other side, we’d
                        take the elevator down into the hold, and that would be it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at Tyson and said, “Now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thank the gods, he understood. He turned and smacked Oreius thirty feet
                        backward into the
                        swimming pool, right into the middle of the zombie tourist family. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah!” the kids yelled in unison. “We are <i class="calibre5">not </i>having a
                        blast in the
                        pool!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">One of the security guards drew his nightstick, but Annabeth knocked the wind
                        out of him with a
                        well-placed kick. The other guard ran for the nearest alarm box. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stop him!” Annabeth yelled, but it was too late. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Just before I banged him on head with a deck chair, he hit the alarm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Red lights flashed. Sirens wailed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Lifeboat!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We ran for the nearest one. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">By the time we got the cover off, monsters and more security men were swarming
                        the deck,
                        pushing aside tourists and waiters with trays of tropical drinks. A guy in Greek armor drew his
                        sword and
                        charged, but slipped in a puddle of piña colada. Laistrygonian archers assembled on the deck
                        above us, notching
                        arrows in their enormous bows. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How do you launch this thing?” screamed Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A hellhound leaped at me, but Tyson slammed it aside with a fire extinguisher.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get in!” I yelled. I uncapped Riptide and slashed the first volley of arrows
                        out of the air.
                        Any second we would be overwhelmed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The lifeboat was hanging over the side of the ship, high above the water.
                        Annabeth and Tyson
                        were having no luck with the release pulley. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I jumped in beside them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hold on!” I yelled, and I cut the ropes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A shower of arrows whistled over our heads as we free-fell toward the ocean.
                    </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">“Thermos!” I screamed as we hurtled toward the water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">What?</i>” Annabeth must’ve thought I’d lost my mind. She
                        was holding on
                        to the boat straps for dear life, her hair flying straight up like a torch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But Tyson understood. He managed to open my duffel bag and take out Hermes’s
                        magical thermos
                        without losing his grip on it or the boat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Arrows and javelins whistled past us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I grabbed the thermos and hoped I was doing the right thing. “Hang on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I <i class="calibre5">am </i>hanging on!” Annabeth yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tighter!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hooked my feet under the boat’s inflatable bench, and as Tyson grabbed
                        Annabeth and me by the
                        backs of our shirts, I gave the thermos cap a quarter turn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Instantly, a white sheet of wind jetted out of the thermos and propelled us
                        sideways, turning
                        our downward plummet into a forty-five-degree crash landing. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/10-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The wind seemed to laugh as it shot from the thermos, like it was glad to be
                        free. As we hit
                        the ocean, we bumped once, twice, skipping like a stone, then we were whizzing along like a
                        speed boat, salt
                        spray in our faces and nothing but sea ahead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I heard a wail of outrage from the ship behind us, but we were already out of
                        weapon range. The
                        <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda </i>faded to the size of a white toy boat in the
                        distance, and then it
                        was gone.

                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">As we raced over the sea, Annabeth and I tried to send an Iris-message to
                        Chiron. We figured it
                        was important we let somebody know what Luke was doing, and we didn’t know who else to trust.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The wind from the thermos stirred up a nice sea spray that made a rainbow in
                        the
                        sunlight—perfect for an Iris-message—but our connection was still poor. When Annabeth threw a
                        gold drachma into
                        the mist and prayed for the rainbow goddess to show us Chiron, his face appeared all right, but
                        there was some
                        kind of weird strobe light flashing in the background and rock music blaring, like he was at a
                        dance club. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We told him about sneaking away from camp, and Luke and the <i
                            class="calibre5">Princess
                            Andromeda </i>and the golden box for Kronos’s remains, but between the noise on his end and
                        the rushing wind
                        and water on our end, I’m not sure how much he heard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” Chiron yelled, “you have to watch out for—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His voice was drowned out by loud shouting behind him—a bunch of voices
                        whooping it up like
                        Comanche warriors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Curse my relatives!” Chiron ducked as a plate flew over his head and shattered
                        somewhere out
                        of sight. “Annabeth, you shouldn’t have let Percy leave camp! But if you <i class="calibre5">do
                        </i>get the
                        Fleece—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, baby!” somebody behind Chiron yelled. “Woohoooooo!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The music got cranked up, subwoofers so loud it made our boat vibrate. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“—Miami,” Chiron was yelling. “I’ll try to keep watch—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Our misty screen smashed apart like someone on the other side had thrown a
                        bottle at it, and
                        Chiron was gone. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">An hour later we spotted land—a long stretch of beach lined with high-rise
                        hotels. The water
                        became crowded with fishing boats and tankers. A coast guard cruiser passed on our starboard
                        side, then turned
                        like it wanted a second look. I guess it isn’t every day they see a yellow lifeboat with no
                        engine going a
                        hundred knots an hour, manned by three kids. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s Virginia Beach!” Annabeth said as we approached the shoreline. “Oh my
                        gods, how did the
                        <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda </i>travel so far overnight? That’s like—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Five hundred and thirty nautical miles,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She stared at me. “How did you know that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I—I’m not sure.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth thought for a moment. “Percy, what’s our position?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“36 degrees, 44 minutes north, 76 degrees, 2 minutes west,” I said immediately.
                        Then I shook my
                        head. “Whoa. How did I know that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Because of your dad,” Annabeth guessed. “When you’re at sea, you have perfect
                        bearings. That
                        is <i class="calibre5">so </i>cool.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wasn’t sure about that. I didn’t want to be a human GPS unit. But before I
                        could say
                        anything, Tyson tapped my shoulder. “Other boat is coming.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked back. The coast guard vessel was definitely on our tail now. Its
                        lights were flashing
                        and it was gaining speed. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“We can’t let them catch us,” I said. “They’ll ask too many questions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Keep going into Chesapeake Bay,” Annabeth said. “I know a place we can hide.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t ask what she meant, or how she knew the area so well. I risked
                        loosening the thermos
                        cap a little more, and a fresh burst of wind sent us rocketing around the northern tip of
                        Virginia Beach into
                        Chesapeake Bay. The coast guard boat fell farther and farther behind. We didn’t slow down until
                        the shores of
                        the bay narrowed on either side, and I realized we’d entered the mouth of a river. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I could feel the change from salt water to fresh water. Suddenly I was tired
                        and frazzled, like
                        I was coming down off a sugar high. I didn’t know where I was anymore, or which way to steer the
                        boat. It was a
                        good thing Annabeth was directing me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There,” she said. “Past that sandbar.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We veered into a swampy area choked with marsh grass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I beached the lifeboat at the foot of a giant cypress. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Vine-covered trees loomed above us. Insects chirred in the woods. The air was
                        muggy and hot,
                        and steam curled off the river. Basically, it wasn’t Manhattan, and I didn’t like it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come on,” Annabeth said. “It’s just down the bank.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What is?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Just follow.” She grabbed a duffel bag. “And we’d better cover the boat. We
                        don’t want to draw
                        attention.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">After burying the lifeboat with branches, Tyson and I followed Annabeth along
                        the shore, our
                        feet sinking in red mud. A snake slithered past my shoe and disappeared into the grass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not a good place,” Tyson said. He swatted the mosquitoes that were forming a
                        buffet line on
                        his arm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">After another few minutes, Annabeth said, “Here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">All I saw was a patch of brambles. Then Annabeth moved aside a woven circle of
                        branches, like a
                        door, and I realized I was looking into a camouflaged shelter. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/10-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The inside was big enough for three, even with Tyson being the third. The walls
                        were woven from
                        plant material, like a Native American hut, but they looked pretty waterproof. Stacked in the
                        corner was
                        everything you could want for a campout—sleeping bags, blankets, an ice chest, and a kerosene
                        lamp. There were
                        demigod provisions, too—bronze javelin tips, a quiver full of arrows, an extra sword, and a box
                        of ambrosia. The
                        place smelled musty, like it had been vacant for a long time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A half-blood hideout.” I looked at Annabeth in awe. “You <i
                            class="calibre5">made </i>this
                        place?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thalia and I,” she said quietly. “And Luke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That shouldn’t have bothered me. I mean, I knew Thalia and Luke had taken care
                        of Annabeth when
                        she was little. I knew the three of them had been runaways together, hiding from monsters,
                        surviving on their
                        own before Grover found them and tried to get them to Half-Blood Hill. But whenever Annabeth
                        talked about the
                        time she’d spent with them, I kind of felt... I don’t know. Uncomfortable? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">No. That’s not the word. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The word was <i class="calibre5">jealous</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So...” I said. “You don’t think Luke will look for us here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She shook her head. “We made a dozen safe houses like this. I doubt Luke even
                        remembers where
                        they are. Or cares.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She threw herself down on the blankets and started going through her duffel
                        bag. Her body
                        language made it pretty clear she didn’t want to talk. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, Tyson?” I said. “Would you mind scouting around outside? Like, look for a
                        wilderness
                        convenience store or something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Convenience store?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, for snacks. Powdered donuts or something. Just don’t go too far.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Powdered donuts,” Tyson said earnestly. “I will look for powdered donuts in
                        the wilderness.”
                        He headed outside and started calling, “Here, donuts!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Once he was gone, I sat down across from Annabeth. “Hey, I’m sorry about, you
                        know, seeing
                        Luke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s not your fault.” She unsheathed her knife and started cleaning the blade
                        with a rag. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He let us go too easily,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hoped I’d been imagining it, but Annabeth nodded. “I was thinking the same
                        thing. What we
                        overheard him say about a gamble, and ‘they’ll take the bait’... I think he was talking about
                        us.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Fleece is the bait? Or Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She studied the edge of her knife. “I don’t know, Percy. Maybe he wants the
                        Fleece for himself.
                        Maybe he’s hoping we’ll do the hard work and then he can steal it from us. I just can’t believe
                        he would poison
                        the tree.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What did he mean,” I asked, “that Thalia would’ve been on his side?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He’s wrong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You don’t sound sure.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth glared at me, and I started to wish I hadn’t asked her about this
                        while she was
                        holding a knife. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, you know who you remind me of most? <i class="calibre5">Thalia. </i>You
                        guys are so
                        much alike it’s scary. I mean, either you would’ve been best friends or you would’ve strangled
                        each other.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Let’s go with ‘best friends.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thalia got angry with her dad sometimes. So do you. Would <i
                            class="calibre5">you </i>turn
                        against Olympus because of that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at the quiver of arrows in the corner. “No.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Okay, then. Neither would she. Luke’s wrong.” Annabeth stuck her knife blade
                        into the dirt.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to ask her about the prophecy Luke had mentioned and what it had to do
                        with my
                        sixteenth birthday. But I figured she wouldn’t tell me. Chiron had made it pretty clear that I
                        wasn’t allowed to
                        hear it until the gods decided otherwise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So what did Luke mean about Cyclopes?” I asked. “He said you of all people—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know what he said. He... he was talking about the <i class="calibre5">real
                        </i>reason Thalia
                        died.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I waited, not sure what to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth drew a shaky breath. “You can never trust a Cyclops, Percy. Six years
                        ago, on the
                        night Grover was leading us to Half-Blood Hill—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She was interrupted when the door of the hut creaked open. Tyson crawled in.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Powdered donuts!” he said proudly, holding up a pastry box. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth stared at him. “Where did you get that? We’re in the middle of the
                        wilderness. There’s
                        nothing around for—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fifty feet,” Tyson said. “Monster Donut shop—just over the hill!” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">“This is bad,” Annabeth muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were crouching behind a tree, staring at the donut shop in the middle of the
                        woods. It
                        looked brand new, with brightly lit windows, a parking area, and a little road leading off into
                        the forest, but
                        there was nothing else around, and no cars parked in the lot. We could see one employee reading
                        a magazine
                        behind the cash register. That was it. On the store’s marquis, in huge black letters that even I
                        could read, it
                        said: </p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="center"><strong class="calibre15">MONSTER DONUT</strong> </p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="calibre13">A cartoon ogre was taking a bite out of the <i class="calibre5">O </i>in <i
                            class="calibre5">MONSTER</i>. The place smelled good, like fresh-baked chocolate donuts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This shouldn’t be here,” Annabeth whispered. “It’s wrong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” I asked. “It’s a donut shop.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Shhh!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why are we whispering? Tyson went in and bought a dozen. Nothing happened to
                        him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">He’s </i>a monster.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Aw, c’mon, Annabeth. Monster Donut doesn’t mean monsters! It’s a chain. We’ve
                        got them in New
                        York.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A chain,” she agreed. “And don’t you think it’s strange that one appeared
                        immediately after
                        you told Tyson to get donuts? Right here in the middle of the woods?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought about it. It did seem a little weird, but, I mean, donut shops
                        weren’t real high on
                        my list of sinister forces. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It could be a nest,” Annabeth explained. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson whimpered. I doubt he understood what Annabeth was saying any better than
                        I did, but her
                        tone was making him nervous. He’d plowed through half a dozen donuts from his box and was
                        getting powdered sugar
                        all over his face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A nest for what?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Haven’t you ever wondered how franchise stores pop up so fast?” she asked.
                        “One day there’s
                        nothing and then the next day—<i class="calibre5">boom</i>, there’s a new burger place or a
                        coffee shop or
                        whatever? First a single store, then two, then four—exact replicas spreading across the
                        country?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, no. Never thought about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, some of the chains multiply so fast because all their locations are
                        magically linked to
                        the life force of a monster. Some children of Hermes figured out how to do it back in the 1950s.
                        They breed—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She froze. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” I demanded. “They breed what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No—sudden—moves,” Annabeth said, like her life depended on it. “Very slowly,
                        turn around.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I heard it: a scraping noise, like something large dragging its belly
                        through the leaves.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned and saw a rhino-size <i class="calibre5">thing </i>moving through the
                        shadows of the
                        trees. It was hissing, its front half writhing in all different directions. I couldn’t
                        understand what I was
                        seeing at first. Then I realized the thing had multiple necks—at least seven, each topped with a
                        hissing
                        reptilian head. Its skin was leathery, and under each neck it wore a plastic bib that read:
                        <small class="calibre4">I’M A MONSTER DONUT KID!</small>
                    </p>

                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/10-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I took out my ballpoint pen, but Annabeth locked eyes with me—a silent warning.
                        <i class="calibre5">Not yet</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I understood. A lot of monsters have terrible eyesight. It was possible the
                        Hydra might pass us
                        by. But if I uncapped my sword now, the bronze glow would certainly get its attention. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We waited. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Hydra was only a few feet away. It seemed to be sniffing the ground and the
                        trees like it
                        was hunting for something. Then I noticed that two of the heads were ripping apart a piece of
                        yellow canvas—one
                        of our duffel bags. The thing had already been to our campsite. It was following our scent. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My heart pounded. I’d seen a stuffed Hydra-head trophy at camp before, but that
                        did nothing to
                        prepare me for the real thing. Each head was diamond-shaped, like a rattlesnake’s, but the
                        mouths were lined
                        with jagged rows of sharklike teeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson was trembling. He stepped back and accidentally snapped a twig.
                        Immediately, all seven
                        heads turned toward us and hissed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Scatter!” Annabeth yelled. She dove to the right. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I rolled to the left. One of the Hydra heads spat an arc of green liquid that
                        shot past my
                        shoulder and splashed against an elm. The trunk smoked and began to disintegrate. The whole tree
                        toppled
                        straight toward Tyson, who still hadn’t moved, petrified by the monster that was now right in
                        front of him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” I tackled him with all my might, knocking him aside just as the Hydra
                        lunged and the
                        tree crashed on top of two of its heads. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Hydra stumbled backward, yanking its heads free then wailing in outrage at
                        the fallen tree.
                        All seven heads shot acid, and the elm melted into a steaming pool of muck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Move!” I told Tyson. I ran to one side and uncapped Riptide, hoping to draw
                        the monster’s
                        attention. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It worked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The sight of celestial bronze is hateful to most monsters. As soon as my
                        glowing blade
                        appeared, the Hydra whipped toward it with all its heads, hissing and baring its teeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The good news: Tyson was momentarily out of danger. The bad news: I was about
                        to be melted into
                        a puddle of goo. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">One of the heads snapped at me experimentally. Without thinking, I swung my
                        sword. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/10-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Annabeth yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Too late. I sliced the Hydra’s head clean off. It rolled away into the grass,
                        leaving a
                        flailing stump, which immediately stopped bleeding and began to swell like a balloon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In a matter of seconds the wounded neck split into two necks, each of which
                        grew a full-size
                        head. Now I was looking at an eight-headed Hydra. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Annabeth scolded. “You just opened another Monster Donut shop
                        somewhere!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I dodged a spray of acid. “I’m about to die and you’re worried about <i
                            class="calibre5">that</i>? How do we kill it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Fire!” Annabeth said. “We have to have fire!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As soon as she said that, I remembered the story. The Hydra’s heads would only
                        stop multiplying
                        if we burned the stumps before they regrew. That’s what Heracles had done, anyway. But we had no
                        fire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I backed up toward river. The Hydra followed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth moved in on my left and tried to distract one of the heads, parrying
                        its teeth with
                        her knife, but another head swung sideways like a club and knocked her into the muck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No hitting my friends!” Tyson charged in, putting himself between the Hydra
                        and Annabeth. As
                        Annabeth got to her feet, Tyson started smashing at the monster heads with his fists so fast it
                        reminded me of
                        the whack-a-mole game at the arcade. But even Tyson couldn’t fend off the Hydra forever. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We kept inching backward, dodging acid splashes and deflecting snapping heads
                        without cutting
                        them off, but I knew we were only postponing our deaths. Eventually, we would make a mistake and
                        the thing would
                        kill us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I heard a strange sound—a chug-chug-chug that at first I thought was my
                        heartbeat. It was
                        so powerful it made the riverbank shake. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What’s that noise?” Annabeth shouted, keeping her eyes on the Hydra. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Steam engine,” Tyson said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">What?</i>” I ducked as the Hydra spat acid over my head.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then from the river behind us, a familiar female voice shouted: “There! Prepare
                        the
                        thirty-two-pounder!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t dare look away from the Hydra, but if that was who I thought it was
                        behind us, I
                        figured we now had enemies on two fronts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A gravelly male voice said, “They’re too close, m’lady!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Damn the heroes!” the girl said. “Full steam ahead!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Aye, m’lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Fire at will, Captain!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth understood what was happening a split second before I did. She yelled,
                        “Hit the dirt!”
                        and we dove for the ground as an earth-shattering <i class="calibre5">BOOM </i>echoed from the
                        river. There was
                        a flash of light, a column of smoke, and the Hydra exploded right in front of us, showering us
                        with nasty green
                        slime that vaporized as soon as it hit, the way monster guts tend to do. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Gross!” screamed Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Steamship!” yelled Tyson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stood, coughing from the cloud of gunpowder smoke that was rolling across the
                        banks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chugging toward us down the river was the strangest ship I’d ever seen. It rode
                        low in the
                        water like a submarine, its deck plated with iron. In the middle was a trapezoid-shaped casemate
                        with slats on
                        each side for cannons. A flag waved from the top—a wild boar and spear on a bloodred field.
                        Lining the deck were
                        zombies in gray uniforms—dead soldiers with shimmering faces that only partially covered their
                        skulls, like the
                        ghouls I’d seen in the Underworld guarding Hades’s palace. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The ship was an ironclad. A Civil War battle cruiser. I could just make out the
                        name along the
                        prow in moss-covered letters: CSS <i class="calibre5">Birmingham</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And standing next to the smoking cannon that had almost killed us, wearing full
                        Greek battle
                        armor, was Clarisse. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">We’d just finished a ship tour we didn’t want, through dark rooms overcrowded
                        with dead
                        sailors. We’d seen the coal bunker, the boilers and engine, which huffed and groaned like it
                        would explode any
                        minute. We’d seen the pilothouse and the powder magazine and gunnery deck (Clarisse’s favorite)
                        with two
                        Dahlgren smoothbore cannons on the port and starboard sides and a Brooke nine-inch rifled gun
                        fore and aft—all
                        specially refitted to fire celestial bronze cannon balls. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everywhere we went, dead Confederate sailors stared at us, their ghostly
                        bearded faces
                        shimmering over their skulls. They approved of Annabeth because she told them she was from
                        Virginia. They were
                        interested in me, too, because my name was Jackson—like the Southern general—but then I ruined
                        it by telling
                        them I was from New York. They all hissed and muttered curses about Yankees. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson was terrified of them. All through the tour, he insisted Annabeth hold
                        his hand, which
                        she didn’t look too thrilled about. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally, we were escorted to dinner. The CSS <i class="calibre5">Birmingham
                        </i>captain’s
                        quarters were about the size of a walk-in closet, but still much bigger than any other room on
                        board. The table
                        was set with white linen and china. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, potato chips, and Dr
                        Peppers were served
                        by skeletal crewmen. I didn’t want to eat anything served by ghosts, but my hunger overruled my
                        fear. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tantalus expelled you for eternity,” Clarisse told us smugly. “Mr. D said if
                        any of you show
                        your face at camp again, he’ll turn you into squirrels and run you over with his SUV.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Did <i class="calibre5">they </i>give you this ship?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“’Course not. My father did.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Ares?</i>” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse sneered. “You think your daddy is the only one with sea power? The
                        spirits on the
                        losing side of every war owe a tribute to Ares. That’s their curse for being defeated. I prayed
                        to my father for
                        a naval transport and here it is. These guys will do anything I tell them. Won’t you, Captain?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The captain stood behind her looking stiff and angry. His glowing green eyes
                        fixed me with a
                        hungry stare. “If it means an end to this infernal war, ma’am, peace at last, we’ll do anything.
                        Destroy
                        anyone.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse smiled. “Destroy anyone. I like that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson gulped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Clarisse,” Annabeth said, “Luke might be after the Fleece, too. We saw him.
                        He’s got the
                        coordinates and he’s heading south. He has a cruise ship full of monsters—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Good! I’ll blow him out of the water.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You don’t understand,” Annabeth said. “We have to combine forces. Let us help
                        you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Clarisse pounded the table. “This is <i class="calibre5">my </i>quest,
                        smart girl!
                        Finally <i class="calibre5">I </i>get to be the hero, and you two will <i class="calibre5">not
                        </i>steal my
                        chance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Where are your cabin mates?” I asked. “You were allowed to take two friends
                        with you, weren’t
                        you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They didn’t... I let them stay behind. To protect the camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You mean even the people in your own cabin wouldn’t help you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Shut up, Prissy! I don’t need them! Or you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Clarisse,” I said, “Tantalus is using you. He doesn’t care about the camp.
                        He’d love to see it
                        destroyed. He’s setting you up to fail.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No! I don’t care what the Oracle—” She stopped herself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” I said. “What did the Oracle tell you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nothing.” Clarisse’s ears turned pink. “All you need to know is that I’m
                        finishing this quest
                        and you’re <i class="calibre5">not </i>helping. On the other hand, I can’t let you go...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So we’re prisoners?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Guests. For now.” Clarisse propped her feet up on the white linen tablecloth
                        and opened
                        another Dr Pepper. “Captain, take them below. Assign them hammocks on the berth deck. If they
                        don’t mind their
                        manners, show them how we deal with enemy spies.” </p>

                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The dream came as soon as I fell asleep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover was sitting at his loom, desperately unraveling his wedding train, when
                        the boulder door
                        rolled aside and the Cyclops bellowed, “Aha!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover yelped. “Dear! I didn’t—you were so quiet!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Unraveling!” Polyphemus roared. “So that’s the problem!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, no. I—I wasn’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come!” Polyphemus grabbed Grover around the waist and half carried, half
                        dragged him through
                        the tunnels of the cave. Grover struggled to keep his high heels on his hooves. His veil kept
                        tilting on his
                        head, threatening to come off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Cyclops pulled him into a warehouse-size cavern decorated with sheep junk.
                        There was a
                        wool-covered La-Z-Boy recliner and a wool-covered television set, crude bookshelves loaded with
                        sheep
                        collectibles—coffee mugs shaped like sheep faces, plaster figurines of sheep, sheep board games,
                        and picture
                        books and action figures. The floor was littered with piles of sheep bones, and other bones that
                        didn’t look
                        exactly like sheep—the bones of satyrs who’d come to the island looking for Pan. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus set Grover down only long enough to move another huge boulder.
                        Daylight streamed
                        into the cave, and Grover whimpered with longing. Fresh air! </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Cyclops dragged him outside to a hilltop overlooking the most beautiful
                        island I’d ever
                        seen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was shaped kind of like a saddle cut in half by an ax. There were lush green
                        hills on either
                        side and a wide valley in the middle, split by a deep chasm that was spanned by a rope bridge.
                        Beautiful streams
                        rolled to the edge of the canyon and dropped off in rainbow-colored waterfalls. Parrots
                        fluttered in the trees.
                        Pink and purple flowers bloomed on the bushes. Hundreds of sheep grazed in the meadows, their
                        wool glinting
                        strangely like copper and silver coins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And at the center of the island, right next to the rope bridge, was an enormous
                        twisted oak
                        tree with something glittering in its lowest bough. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Golden Fleece. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/11-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Even in a dream, I could feel its power radiating across the island, making the
                        grass greener,
                        the flowers more beautiful. I could almost smell the nature magic at work. I could only imagine
                        how powerful the
                        scent would be for a satyr. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover whimpered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes,” Polyphemus said proudly. “See over there? Fleece is the prize of my
                        collection! Stole it
                        from heroes long ago, and ever since—free food! Satyrs come from all over the world, like moths
                        to flame. Satyrs
                        good eating! And now—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus scooped up a wicked set of bronze shears. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover yelped, but Polyphemus just picked up the nearest sheep like it was a
                        stuffed animal and
                        shaved off its wool. He handed a fluffy mass of it to Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Put that on the spinning wheel!” he said proudly. “Magic. Cannot be
                        unraveled.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh... well...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Poor Honeypie!” Polyphemus grinned. “Bad weaver. Ha-ha! Not to worry. That
                        thread will solve
                        problem. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finish wedding train by tomorrow!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Isn’t that... thoughtful of you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hehe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But—but, dear,” Grover gulped, “what if someone were to rescue—I mean attack
                        this island?”
                        Grover looked straight at me, and I knew he was asking for my benefit. “What would keep them
                        from marching right
                        up here to your cave?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wifey scared! So cute! Not to worry. Polyphemus has state-of-the-art security
                        system. Have to
                        get through my pets.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Pets?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked across the island, but there was nothing to see except sheep
                        grazing peacefully
                        in the meadows. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And then,” Polyphemus growled, “they would have to get through me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He pounded his fist against the nearest rock, which cracked and split in half.
                        “Now, come!” he
                        shouted. “Back to the cave.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover looked about ready to cry—so close to freedom, but so hopelessly far.
                        Tears welled in
                        his eyes as the boulder door rolled shut, sealing him once again in the stinky torch-lit
                        dankness of the
                        Cyclops’s cave. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I woke to alarm bells ringing throughout the ship. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The captain’s gravelly voice: “All hands on deck! Find Lady Clarisse! Where is
                        that girl?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then his ghostly face appeared above me. “Get up, Yankee. Your friends are
                        already above. We
                        are approaching the entrance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The entrance to what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gave me a skeletal smile. “The Sea of Monsters, of course.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I stuffed my few belongings that had survived the Hydra into a sailor’s canvas
                        knapsack and
                        slung it over my shoulder. I had a sneaking suspicion that one way or another I would not be
                        spending another
                        night aboard the CSS <i class="calibre5">Birmingham</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was on my way upstairs when something made me freeze. A presence
                        nearby—something familiar
                        and unpleasant. For no particular reason, I felt like picking a fight. I wanted to punch a dead
                        Confederate. The
                        last time I’d felt like that kind of anger... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Instead of going up, I crept to the edge of the ventilation grate and peered
                        down into the
                        boiler deck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse was standing right below me, talking to an image that shimmered in the
                        steam from the
                        boilers—a muscular man in black leather biker clothes, with a military haircut, red-tinted
                        sunglasses, and a
                        knife strapped to his side. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My fists clenched. It was my least favorite Olympian: Ares, the god of war.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t want excuses, little girl!” he growled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Y-yes, father,” Clarisse mumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You don’t want to see me mad, do you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, father.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">No, father</i>,” Ares mimicked. “You’re pathetic. I
                        should’ve let one of
                        my <i class="calibre5">sons </i>take this quest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll succeed!” Clarisse promised, her voice trembling. “I’ll make you proud.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’d better,” he warned. “You asked me for this quest, girl. If you let that
                        slimeball
                        Jackson kid steal it from you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But the Oracle said—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I DON’T CARE WHAT IT SAID!” Ares bellowed with such force that his image
                        shimmered. “You <i class="calibre5">will </i>succeed. And if you don’t...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He raised his fist. Even though he was only a figure in the steam, Clarisse
                        flinched. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Do we understand each other?” Ares growled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The alarm bells rang again. I heard voices coming toward me, officers yelling
                        orders to ready
                        the cannons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I crept back from the ventilation grate and made my way upstairs to join
                        Annabeth and Tyson on
                        the spar deck. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">“What’s wrong?” Annabeth asked me. “Another dream?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I nodded, but I didn’t say anything. I didn’t know what to think about what I’d
                        seen
                        downstairs. It bothered me almost as much as the dream about Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse came up the stairs right after me. I tried not to look at her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She grabbed a pair of binoculars from a zombie officer and peered toward the
                        horizon. “At last.
                        Captain, full steam ahead!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked in the same direction as she was, but I couldn’t see much. The sky was
                        overcast. The
                        air was hazy and humid, like steam from an iron. If I squinted real hard, I could just make out
                        a couple of dark
                        fuzzy splotches in the distance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My nautical senses told me we were somewhere off the coast of northern Florida,
                        so we’d come a
                        long way overnight, farther than any mortal ship should’ve been able to travel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The engine groaned as we increased speed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson muttered nervously, “Too much strain on the pistons. Not meant for deep
                        water.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wasn’t sure how he knew that, but it made me nervous. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">After a few more minutes, the dark splotches ahead of us came into focus. To
                        the north, a huge
                        mass of rock rose out of the sea—an island with cliffs at least a hundred feet tall. About half
                        a mile south of
                        that, the other patch of darkness was a storm brewing. The sky and sea boiled together in a
                        roaring mass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hurricane?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” Clarisse said. “Charybdis.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth paled. “Are you crazy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Only way into the Sea of Monsters. Straight between Charybdis and her sister
                        Scylla.” Clarisse
                        pointed to the top of the cliffs, and I got the feeling something lived up there that I did not
                        want to meet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean the only way?” I asked. “The sea is wide open! Just sail
                        around them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse rolled her eyes. “Don’t you know anything? If I tried to sail around
                        them, they would
                        just appear in my path again. If you want to get into the Sea of Monsters, you <i
                            class="calibre5">have </i>to
                        sail through them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What about the Clashing Rocks?” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s another gateway. Jason used it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I can’t blow apart rocks with my cannons,” Clarisse said. “Monsters, on the
                        other hand...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You <i class="calibre5">are </i>crazy,” Annabeth decided. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Watch and learn, Wise Girl.” Clarisse turned to the captain. “Set course for
                        Charybdis!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Aye, m’lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The engine groaned, the iron plating rattled, and the ship began to pick up
                        speed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Clarisse,” I said, “Charybdis sucks up the sea. Isn’t that the story?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And spits it back out again, yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What about Scylla?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“She lives in a cave, up on those cliffs. If we get too close, her snaky heads
                        will come down
                        and start plucking sailors off the ship.” </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Choose Scylla then,” I said. “Everybody goes below deck and we chug right
                        past.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Clarisse insisted. “If Scylla doesn’t get her easy meat, she might pick
                        up the whole
                        ship. Besides, she’s too high to make a good target. My cannons can’t shoot straight up.
                        Charybdis just sits
                        there at the center of her whirlwind. We’re going to steam straight toward her, train our guns
                        on her, and blow
                        her to Tartarus!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She said it with such relish I almost wanted to believe her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The engine hummed. The boilers were heating up so much I could feel the deck
                        getting warm
                        beneath my feet. The smokestacks billowed. The red Ares flag whipped in the wind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As we got closer to the monsters, the sound of Charybdis got louder and
                        louder—a horrible wet
                        roar like the galaxy’s biggest toilet being flushed. Every time Charybdis inhaled, the ship
                        shuddered and
                        lurched forward. Every time she exhaled, we rose in the water and were buffeted by ten-foot
                        waves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to time the whirlpool. As near as I could figure, it took Charybdis
                        about three minutes
                        to suck up and destroy everything within a half-mile radius. To avoid her, we would have to
                        skirt right next to
                        Scylla’s cliffs. And as bad as Scylla might be, those cliffs were looking awfully good to me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Undead sailors calmly went about their business on the spar deck. I guess
                        they’d fought a
                        losing cause before, so this didn’t bother them. Or maybe they didn’t care about getting
                        destroyed because they
                        were already deceased. Neither thought made me feel any better. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth stood next to me, gripping the rail. “You still have your thermos full
                        of wind?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I nodded. “But it’s too dangerous to use with a whirlpool like that. More wind
                        might just make
                        things worse.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What about controlling the water?” she asked. “You’re Poseidon’s son. You’ve
                        done it before.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She was right. I closed my eyes and tried to calm the sea, but I couldn’t
                        concentrate.
                        Charybdis was too loud and powerful. The waves wouldn’t respond. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I—I can’t,” I said miserably. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We need a backup plan,” Annabeth said. “This isn’t going to work.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth is right,” Tyson said. “Engine’s no good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” she asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Pressure. Pistons need fixing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before he could explain, the cosmic toilet flushed with a mighty <i
                            class="calibre5">roaaar!
                        </i>The ship lurched forward and I was thrown to the deck. We were in the whirlpool. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Full reverse!” Clarisse screamed above the noise. The sea churned around us,
                        waves crashing
                        over the deck. The iron plating was now so hot it steamed. “Get us within firing range! Make
                        ready starboard
                        cannons!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dead Confederates rushed back and forth. The propeller grinded into reverse,
                        trying to slow the
                        ship, but we kept sliding toward the center of the vortex. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A zombie sailor burst out of the hold and ran to Clarisse. His gray uniform was
                        smoking. His
                        beard was on fire. “Boiler room overheating, ma’am! She’s going to blow!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, get down there and fix it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Can’t!” the sailor yelled. “We’re vaporizing in the heat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse pounded the side of the casemate. “All I need is a few more minutes!
                        Just enough to
                        get in range!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’re going in too fast,” the captain said grimly. “Prepare yourself for
                        death.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Tyson bellowed. “I can fix it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse looked at him incredulously. “You?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He’s a Cyclops,” Annabeth said. “He’s immune to fire. And he knows mechanics.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Go!” yelled Clarisse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson, no!” I grabbed his arm. “It’s too dangerous!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He patted my hand. “Only way, brother.” His expression was
                        determined—confident, even. I’d
                        never seen him look like this before. “I will fix it. Be right back.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/11-5.png"

                    <p class="calibre13">As I watched him follow the smoldering sailor down the hatch, I had a terrible
                        feeling. I
                        wanted to run after him, but the ship lurched again—and then I saw Charybdis. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She appeared only a few hundred yards away, through a swirl of mist and smoke
                        and water. The
                        first thing I noticed was the reef—a black crag of coral with a fig tree clinging to the top, an
                        oddly peaceful
                        thing in the middle of a maelstrom. All around it, water curved into a funnel, like light around
                        a black hole.
                        Then I saw the horrible thing anchored to the reef just below the waterline—an enormous mouth
                        with slimy lips
                        and mossy teeth the size of rowboats. And worse, the teeth had braces, bands of corroded scummy
                        metal with
                        pieces of fish and driftwood and floating garbage stuck between them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Charybdis was an orthodontist’s nightmare. She was nothing but a huge black maw
                        with bad teeth
                        alignment and a serious overbite, and she’d done nothing for centuries but eat without brushing
                        after meals. As
                        I watched, the entire sea around her was sucked into the void—sharks, schools of fish, a giant
                        squid. And I
                        realized that in a few seconds, the CSS <i class="calibre5">Birmingham </i>would be next. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Lady Clarisse,” the captain shouted. “Starboard and forward guns are in
                        range!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Fire!” Clarisse ordered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Three rounds were blasted into the monster’s maw. One blew off the edge of an
                        incisor. Another
                        disappeared into her gullet. The third hit one of Charybdis’s retaining bands and shot back at
                        us, snapping the
                        Ares flag off its pole. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Again!” Clarisse ordered. The gunners reloaded, but I knew it was hopeless. We
                        would have to
                        pound the monster a hundred more times to do any real damage, and we didn’t have that long. We
                        were being sucked
                        in too fast. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then the vibrations in the deck changed. The hum of the engine got stronger and
                        steadier. The
                        ship shuddered and we started pulling away from the mouth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson did it!” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait!” Clarisse said. “We need to stay close!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll die!” I said. “We <i class="calibre5">have </i>to move away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I gripped the rail as the ship fought against the suction. The broken Ares flag
                        raced past us
                        and lodged in Charybdis’s braces. We weren’t making much progress, but at least we were holding
                        our own. Tyson
                        had somehow given us just enough juice to keep the ship from being sucked in. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Suddenly, the mouth snapped shut. The sea died to absolute calm. Water washed
                        over Charybdis.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then, just as quickly as it had closed, the mouth exploded open, spitting out a
                        wall of water,
                        ejecting everything inedible, including our cannonballs, one of which slammed into the side of
                        the CSS <i class="calibre5">Birmingham </i>with a <i class="calibre5">ding </i>like the bell on
                        a carnival game. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                    <p class="calibre13">We were thrown backward on a wave that must’ve been forty feet high. I used all
                        of my willpower
                        to keep the ship from capsizing, but we were still spinning out of control, hurtling toward the
                        cliffs on the
                        opposite side of the strait. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Another smoldering sailor burst out of the hold. He stumbled into Clarisse,
                        almost knocking
                        them both overboard. “The engine is about to blow!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Where’s Tyson?” I demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Still down there,” the sailor said. “Holding it together somehow, though I
                        don’t know for how
                        much longer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The captain said, “We have to abandon ship.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Clarisse yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We have no choice, m’lady. The hull is already cracking apart! She can’t—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He never finished his sentence. Quick as lightning, something brown and green
                        shot from the
                        sky, snatched up the captain, and lifted him away. All that was left were his leather boots.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Scylla!” a sailor yelled, as another column of reptilian flesh shot from the
                        cliffs and
                        snapped him up. It happened so fast it was like watching a laser beam rather than a monster. I
                        couldn’t even
                        make out the thing’s face, just a flash of teeth and scales. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I uncapped Riptide and tried to swipe at the monster as it carried off another
                        deckhand, but I
                        was way too slow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Everyone get below!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We can’t!” Clarisse drew her own sword. “Below deck is in flames.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Lifeboats!” Annabeth said. “Quick!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They’ll never get clear of the cliffs,” Clarisse said. “We’ll all be eaten.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We have to try. Percy, the thermos.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I can’t leave Tyson!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We have to get the boats ready!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse took Annabeth’s command. She and a few of her undead sailors uncovered
                        one of the two
                        emergency rowboats while Scylla’s heads rained from the sky like a meteor shower with teeth,
                        picking off
                        Confederate sailors one after another. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get the other boat.” I threw Annabeth the thermos. “I’ll get Tyson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You can’t!” she said. “The heat will kill you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t listen. I ran for the boiler room hatch, when suddenly my feet weren’t
                        touching the
                        deck anymore. I was flying straight up, the wind whistling in my ears, the side of the cliff
                        only inches from my
                        face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Scylla had somehow caught me by the knapsack, and was lifting me up toward her
                        lair. Without
                        thinking, I swung my sword behind me and managed to jab the thing in her beady yellow eye. She
                        grunted and
                        dropped me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The fall would’ve been bad enough, considering I was a hundred feet in the air.
                        But as I fell,
                        the CSS <i class="calibre5">Birmingham </i>exploded below me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">KAROOM!</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The engine room blew, sending chunks of ironclad flying in either direction
                        like a fiery set of
                        wings. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The lifeboats had managed to get away from the ship, but not very far. Flaming
                        wreckage was
                        raining down. Clarisse and Annabeth would either be smashed or burned or pulled to the bottom by
                        the force of
                        the sinking hull, and that was thinking optimistically, assuming they got away from Scylla. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I heard a different kind of explosion—the sound of Hermes’s magic thermos
                        being opened a
                        little too far. White sheets of wind blasted in every direction, scattering the lifeboats,
                        lifting me out of my
                        free fall and propelling me across the ocean. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t see anything. I spun in the air, got clonked on the head by
                        something hard, and hit
                        the water with a crash that would’ve broken every bone in my body if I hadn’t been the son of
                        the Sea God. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The last thing I remembered was sinking in a burning sea, knowing that Tyson
                        was gone forever,
                        and wishing I were able to drown. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">I woke up in a rowboat with a makeshift sail stitched of gray uniform fabric.
                        Annabeth sat next
                        to me, tacking into the wind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to sit up and immediately felt woozy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Rest,” she said. “You’re going to need it.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/12-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson... ?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She shook her head. “Percy, I’m really sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were silent while the waves tossed us up and down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He may have survived,” she said halfheartedly. “I mean, fire can’t kill him.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I nodded, but I had no reason to feel hopeful. I’d seen that explosion rip
                        through solid iron.
                        If Tyson had been down in the boiler room, there was no way he could’ve lived. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He’d given his life for us, and all I could think about were the times I’d felt
                        embarrassed by
                        him and had denied that the two of us were related. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Waves lapped at the boat. Annabeth showed me some things she’d salvaged from
                        the
                        wreckage—Hermes’s thermos (now empty), a Ziploc bag full of ambrosia, a couple of sailors’
                        shirts, and a bottle
                        of Dr Pepper. She’d fished me out of the water and found my knapsack, bitten in half by Scylla’s
                        teeth. Most of
                        my stuff had floated away, but I still had Hermes’s bottle of multivitamins, and of course I had
                        Riptide. The
                        ballpoint pen always appeared back in my pocket no matter where I lost it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We sailed for hours. Now that we were in the Sea of Monsters, the water
                        glittered a more
                        brilliant green, like Hydra acid. The wind smelled fresh and salty, but it carried a strange
                        metallic scent,
                        too—as if a thunderstorm were coming. Or something even more dangerous. I knew what direction we
                        needed to go. I
                        knew we were exactly one hundred thirteen nautical miles west by northwest of our destination.
                        But that didn’t
                        make me feel any less lost. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">No matter which way we turned, the sun seemed to shine straight into my eyes.
                        We took turns
                        sipping from the Dr Pepper, shading ourselves with the sail as best we could. And we talked
                        about my latest
                        dream of Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">By Annabeth’s estimate, we had less than twenty-four hours to find Grover,
                        assuming my dream
                        was accurate, and assuming the Cyclops Polyphemus didn’t change his mind and try to marry Grover
                        earlier. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I said bitterly. “You can never trust a Cyclops.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth stared across the water. “I’m sorry, Percy. I was wrong about Tyson,
                        okay? I wish I
                        could tell him that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to stay mad at her, but it wasn’t easy. We’d been through a lot
                        together. She’d saved
                        my life plenty of times. It was stupid of me to resent her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked down at our measly possessions—the empty wind thermos, the bottle of
                        multivitamins. I
                        thought about Luke’s look of rage when I’d tried to talk to him about his dad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth, what’s Chiron’s prophecy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pursed her lips. “Percy, I shouldn’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know Chiron promised the gods he wouldn’t tell me. But <i
                            class="calibre5">you </i>didn’t
                        promise, did you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Knowledge isn’t always good for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Your mom is the wisdom goddess!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know! But every time heroes learn the future, they try to change it, and it
                        never works.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The gods are worried about something I’ll do when I get older,” I guessed.
                        “Something when I
                        turn sixteen.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth twisted her Yankees cap in her hands. “Percy, I don’t know the full
                        prophecy, but it
                        warns about a half-blood child of the Big Three—the next one who lives to the age of sixteen.
                        That’s the real
                        reason Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades swore a pact after World War II not to have any more kids. The
                        next child of
                        the Big Three who reaches sixteen will be a dangerous weapon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Because that hero will decide the fate of Olympus. He or she will make a
                        decision that either
                        saves the Age of the Gods, or destroys it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I let that sink in. I don’t get seasick, but suddenly I felt ill. “That’s why
                        Kronos didn’t
                        kill me last summer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She nodded. “You could be very useful to him. If he can get you on his side,
                        the gods will be
                        in serious trouble.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But if it’s <i class="calibre5">me </i>in the prophecy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll only know that if you survive three more years. That can be a long time
                        for a
                        half-blood. When Chiron first learned about Thalia, he assumed <i class="calibre5">she </i>was
                        the one in the
                        prophecy. That’s why he was so desperate to get her safely to camp. Then she went down fighting
                        and got turned
                        into a pine tree and none of us knew what to think. Until you came along.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">On our port side, a spiky green dorsal fin about fifteen feet long curled out
                        of the water and
                        disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This kid in the prophecy... he or she couldn’t be like, a Cyclops?” I asked.
                        “The
                        Big Three have
                        lots of monster children.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth shook her head. “The Oracle said ‘halfblood.’ That always means
                        half-human, half-god.
                        There’s really nobody alive who it could be, except you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then why do the gods even let me live? It would be safer to kill me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thanks a lot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, I don’t know. I guess some of the gods <i class="calibre5">would
                        </i>like to kill you,
                        but they’re probably afraid of offending Poseidon. Other gods... maybe they’re still watching
                        you,
                        trying to decide
                        what kind of hero you’re going to be. You could be a weapon for their survival, after all. The
                        real question
                        is... what will you do in three years? What decision will you make?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Did the prophecy give any hints?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth hesitated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Maybe she would’ve told me more, but just then a seagull swooped down out of
                        nowhere and landed
                        on our makeshift mast. Annabeth looked startled as the bird dropped a small cluster of leaves
                        into her lap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Land,” she said. “There’s land nearby!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sat up. Sure enough, there was a line of blue and brown in the distance.
                        Another minute and I
                        could make out an island with a small mountain in the center, a dazzling white collection of
                        buildings, a beach
                        dotted with palm trees, and a harbor filled with a strange assortment of boats. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The current was pulling our rowboat toward what looked like a tropical
                        paradise. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">“Welcome!” said the lady with the clipboard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked like a flight attendant—blue business suit, perfect makeup, hair
                        pulled back in a
                        ponytail. She shook our hands as we stepped onto the dock. With the dazzling smile she gave us,
                        you would’ve
                        thought we’d just gotten off the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda </i>rather than a
                        banged-up rowboat.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then again, our rowboat wasn’t the weirdest ship in port. Along with a bunch of
                        pleasure
                        yachts, there was a U.S. Navy submarine, several dugout canoes, and an old-fashioned
                        three-masted sailing ship.
                        There was a helipad with a “Channel Five Fort Lauderdale” helicopter on it, and a short runway
                        with a Learjet
                        and a propeller plane that looked like a World War II fighter. Maybe they were replicas for
                        tourists to look at
                        or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Is this your first time with us?” the clipboard lady inquired. Annabeth and I
                        exchanged looks.
                        Annabeth said, “Umm...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“First—time—at—spa,” the lady said as she wrote on her clipboard. “Let’s
                        see...”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked us up and down critically. “Mmm. An herbal wrap to start for the
                        young lady. And of
                        course, a complete makeover for the young gentleman.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A what?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She was too busy jotting down notes to answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right!” She said with a breezy smile. “Well, I’m sure C.C. will want to speak
                        with you
                        personally before the luau. Come, please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Now here’s the thing. Annabeth and I were used to traps, and usually those
                        traps looked good at
                        first. So I expected the clipboard lady to turn into a snake or a demon, or something, any
                        minute. But on the
                        other hand, we’d been floating in a rowboat for most of the day. I was hot, tired, and hungry,
                        and when this
                        lady mentioned a luau, my stomach sat up on its hind legs and begged like a dog. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I guess it couldn’t hurt,” Annabeth muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Of course it could, but we followed the lady anyway. I kept my hands in my
                        pockets where I’d
                        stashed my only magic defenses—Hermes’s multivitamins and Riptide—but the farther we wandered
                        into the resort,
                        the more I forgot about them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The place was amazing. There was white marble and blue water everywhere I
                        looked. Terraces
                        climbed up the side of the mountain, with swimming pools on every level, connected by
                        waterslides and waterfalls
                        and underwater tubes you could swim through. Fountains sprayed water into the air, forming
                        impossible shapes,
                        like flying eagles and galloping horses. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/12-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson loved horses, and I knew he’d love those fountains. I almost turned
                        around to see the
                        expression on his face before I remembered: Tyson was gone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You okay?” Annabeth asked me. “You look pale.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m okay,” I lied. “Just... let’s keep walking.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We passed all kinds of tame animals. A sea turtle napped in a stack of beach
                        towels. A leopard
                        stretched out asleep on the diving board. The resort guests—only young women, as far as I could
                        see—lounged in
                        deck chairs, drinking fruit smoothies or reading magazines while herbal gunk dried on their
                        faces and
                        manicurists in white uniforms did their nails. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As we headed up a staircase toward what looked like the main building, I heard
                        a woman singing.
                        Her voice drifted through the air like a lullaby. Her words were in some language other than
                        Ancient Greek, but
                        just as old—Minoan, maybe, or something like that. I could understand what she sang
                        about—moonlight in the olive
                        groves, the colors of the sunrise. And magic. Something about magic. Her voice seemed to lift me
                        off the steps
                        and carry me toward her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We came into a big room where the whole front wall was windows. The back wall
                        was covered in
                        mirrors, so the room seemed to go on forever. There was a bunch of expensive-looking white
                        furniture, and on a
                        table in one corner was a large wire pet cage. The cage seemed out of place, but I didn’t think
                        about it too
                        much, because just then I saw the lady who’d been singing... and whoa. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She sat at a loom the size of a big screen TV, her hands weaving colored thread
                        back and forth
                        with amazing skill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The tapestry shimmered like it was three dimensional—a waterfall scene so real
                        I could see the
                        water moving and clouds drifting across a fabric sky. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth caught her breath. “It’s beautiful.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The woman turned. She was even prettier than her fabric. Her long dark hair was
                        braided with
                        threads of gold. She had piercing green eyes and she wore a silky black dress with shapes that
                        seemed to move in
                        the fabric: animal shadows, black upon black, like deer running through a forest at night. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/12-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“You appreciate weaving, my dear?” the woman asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, yes, ma’am!” Annabeth said. “My mother is—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She stopped herself. You couldn’t just go around announcing that your mom was
                        Athena, the
                        goddess who invented the loom. Most people would lock you in a rubber room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Our hostess just smiled. “You have good taste, my dear. I’m so glad you’ve
                        come. My name is
                        C.C.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The animals in the corner cage started squealing. They must’ve been guinea
                        pigs, from the sound
                        of them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We introduced ourselves to C.C. She looked me over with a twinge of
                        disapproval, as if I’d
                        failed some kind of test. Immediately, I felt bad. For some reason, I really wanted to please
                        this lady. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, dear,” she sighed. “You <i class="calibre5">do </i>need my help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ma’am?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">C.C. called to the lady in the business suit. “Hylla, take Annabeth on a tour,
                        will you? Show
                        her what we have available. The clothing will need to change. And the hair, my goodness. We will
                        do a full image
                        consultation after I’ve spoken with this young gentleman.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But...” Annabeth’s voice sounded hurt. “What’s wrong with my hair?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">C.C. smiled benevolently. “My dear, you are lovely. Really! But you’re not
                        showing off yourself
                        or your talents at all. So much wasted potential!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wasted?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, surely you’re not happy the way you are! My goodness, there’s not a
                        single person who
                        is. But don’t worry. We can improve anyone here at the spa. Hylla will show you what I mean.
                        You, my dear, need
                        to unlock your true self!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth’s eyes glowed with longing. I’d never seen her so much at a loss for
                        words. “But... what
                        about Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, definitely,” C.C. said, giving me a sad look. “Percy requires my personal
                        attention. He
                        needs <i class="calibre5">much </i>more work than you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Normally if somebody had told me that, I would’ve gotten angry, but when C.C.
                        said it, I felt
                        sad. I’d disappointed her. I had to figure out how to do better. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The guinea pigs squealed like they were hungry. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well...” Annabeth said. “I suppose...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right this way, dear,” Hylla said. And Annabeth allowed herself to be led away
                        into the
                        waterfall-laced gardens of the spa. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">C.C. took my arm and guided me toward the mirrored wall. “You see, Percy... to
                        unlock your
                        potential, you’ll need serious help. The first step is admitting that you’re not happy the way
                        you are.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I fidgeted in the front of the mirror. I hated thinking about my
                        appearance—like the first zit
                        that had cropped up on my nose at the beginning of the school year, or the fact that my two
                        front teeth weren’t
                        perfectly even, or that my hair never stayed down straight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">C.C.’s voice brought all of these things to mind, as if she were passing me
                        under a microscope.
                        And my clothes were not cool. I knew that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Who cares? Part of me thought. But standing in front of C.C.’s mirror, it was
                        hard to see
                        anything good in myself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There, there,” C.C. consoled. “How about we try... this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She snapped her fingers and a sky-blue curtain rolled down over the mirror. It
                        shimmered like
                        the fabric on her loom. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you see?” C.C. asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at the blue cloth, not sure what she meant. “I don’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then it changed colors. I saw myself—a reflection, but not a reflection.
                        Shimmering there on
                        the cloth was a cooler version of Percy Jackson—with just the right clothes, a confident smile
                        on my face. My
                        teeth were straight. No zits. A perfect tan. More athletic. Maybe a couple of inches taller. It
                        was me, without
                        the faults. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/12-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whoa,” I managed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Do you want that?” C.C. asked. “Or shall I try a different—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” I said. “That’s... that’s amazing. Can you really—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I can give you a full makeover,” C.C. promised. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What’s the catch?” I said. “I have to like... eat a special diet?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, it’s quite easy,” C.C. said. “Plenty of fresh fruit, a mild exercise
                        program, and of
                        course... this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She stepped over to her wet bar and filled a glass with water. Then she ripped
                        open a drink-mix
                        packet and poured in some red powder. The mixture began to glow. When it faded, the drink looked
                        just like a
                        strawberry milk shake. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“One of these, substituted for a regular meal,” C.C. said. “I guarantee you’ll
                        see results
                        immediately.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How is that possible?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She laughed. “Why question it? I mean, don’t you want the perfect you right
                        away?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Something nagged at the back of my mind. “Why are there no guys at this spa?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, but there are,” C.C. assured me. “You’ll meet them quite soon. Just try
                        the mixture.
                        You’ll see.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at the blue tapestry, at the reflection of me, but not me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now, Percy,” C.C. chided. “The hardest part of the makeover process is giving
                        up control. You
                        have to decide: do you want to trust <i class="calibre5">your </i>judgment about what you should
                        be, or <i class="calibre5">my </i>judgment?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My throat felt dry. I heard myself say, “Your judgment.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">C.C. smiled and handed me the glass. I lifted it to my lips. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It tasted just like it looked—like a strawberry milk shake. Almost immediately
                        a warm feeling
                        spread through my gut: pleasant at first, then painfully hot, searing, as if the mixture were
                        coming to a boil
                        inside of me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I doubled over and dropped the cup. “What have you... what’s happening?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t worry, Percy,” C.C. said. “The pain will pass. Look! As I promised.
                        Immediate results.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Something was horribly wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The curtain dropped away, and in the mirror I saw my hands shriveling, curling,
                        growing long
                        delicate claws. Fur sprouted on my face, under my shirt, in every uncomfortable place you can
                        imagine. My teeth
                        felt too heavy in my mouth. My clothes were getting too big, or C.C. was getting too tall—no, I
                        was shrinking.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In one awful flash, I sank into a cavern of dark cloth. I was buried in my own
                        shirt. I tried
                        to run but hands grabbed me—hands as big as I was. I tried to scream for help, but all that came
                        out of my mouth
                        was, “<i class="calibre5">Reeet, reeet, reeet! </i>” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The giant hands squeezed me around the middle, lifting me into the air. I
                        struggled and kicked
                        with legs and arms that seemed much too stubby, and then I was staring, horrified, into the
                        enormous face of
                        C.C. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Perfect!” her voice boomed. I squirmed in alarm, but she only tightened her
                        grip around my
                        furry belly. “See, Percy? You’ve unlocked your true self!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She held me up to the mirror, and what I saw made me scream in terror, “<i
                            class="calibre5">Reeet, reeet, reeet!</i>” There was C.C., beautiful and smiling, holding a
                        fluffy,
                        bucktoothed creature with tiny claws and white and orange fur. When I twisted, so did the furry
                        critter in the
                        mirror. I was... I was... </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/12-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“A guinea pig,” C.C. said. “Lovely, aren’t you? Men are pigs, Percy Jackson. I
                        used to turn
                        them into <i class="calibre5">real </i>pigs, but they were so smelly and large and difficult to
                        keep. Not much
                        different than they were before, really. Guinea pigs are much more convenient! Now come, and
                        meet the other
                        men.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Reeet!</i>” I protested, trying to scratch her, but C.C.
                        squeezed me so
                        tight I almost blacked out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“None of that, little one,” she scolded, “or I’ll feed you to the owls. Go into
                        the cage like a
                        good little pet. Tomorrow, if you behave, you’ll be on your way. There is always a classroom in
                        need of a new
                        guinea pig.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mind was racing as fast as my tiny little heart. I needed to get back to my
                        clothes, which
                        were lying in a heap on the floor. If I could do that, I could get Riptide out of my pocket
                        and... And what? I
                        couldn’t uncap the pen. Even if I did, I couldn’t hold the sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I squirmed helplessly as C.C. brought me over to the guinea pig cage and opened
                        the wire door.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Meet my discipline problems, Percy,” she warned. “They’ll never make good
                        classroom pets, but
                        they might teach you some manners. Most of them have been in this cage for three hundred years.
                        If you don’t
                        want to stay with them permanently, I’d suggest you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth’s voice called: “Miss C.C.?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">C.C. cursed in Ancient Greek. She plopped me into the cage and closed the door.
                        I squealed and
                        clawed at the bars, but it was no good. I watched as C.C. hurriedly kicked my clothes under the
                        loom just as
                        Annabeth came in. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I almost didn’t recognize her. She was wearing a sleeveless silk dress like
                        C.C.’s, only white.
                        Her blond hair was newly washed and combed and braided with gold. Worst of all, she was wearing
                        makeup, which I
                        never thought Annabeth would be caught dead in. I mean, she looked good. Really good. I probably
                        would’ve been
                        tongue-tied if I could’ve said anything except <i class="calibre5">reet, reet, reet</i>. But
                        there was also
                        something totally wrong about it. It just wasn’t Annabeth. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/12-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked around the room and frowned. “Where’s Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I squealed up a storm, but she didn’t seem to hear me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">C.C. smiled. “He’s having one of our treatments, my dear. Not to worry. You
                        look wonderful!
                        What did you think of your tour?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth’s eyes brightened. “Your library is amazing!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, indeed,” C.C. said. “The best knowledge of the past three millennia.
                        Anything you want to
                        study, anything you want to <i class="calibre5">be</i>, my dear.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“An architect?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Pah!” C.C. said. “You, my dear, have the makings of a sorceress. Like me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth took a step back. “A sorceress?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, my dear.” C.C. held up her hand. A flame appeared in her palm and danced
                        across her
                        fingertips. “My mother is Hecate, the goddess of magic. I know a daughter of Athena when I see
                        one. We are not
                        so different, you and I. We both seek knowledge. We both admire greatness. Neither of us needs
                        to stand in the
                        shadow of men.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I—I don’t understand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Again, I squealed my best, trying to get Annabeth’s attention, but she either
                        couldn’t hear me
                        or didn’t think the noises were important. Meanwhile, the other guinea pigs were emerging from
                        their hutch to
                        check me out. I didn’t think it was possible for guinea pigs to look mean, but these did. There
                        were half a
                        dozen, with dirty fur and cracked teeth and beady red eyes. They were covered with shavings and
                        smelled like
                        they really had been in here for three hundred years, without getting their cage cleaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stay with me,” C.C. was telling Annabeth. “Study with me. You can join our
                        staff, become a
                        sorceress, learn to bend others to your will. You will become immortal!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You are too intelligent, my dear,” C.C. said. “You know better than to trust
                        that silly camp
                        for heroes. How many great female half-blood heroes can you name?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, Atalanta, Amelia Earhart—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bah! Men get all the glory.” C.C. closed her fist and extinguished the magic
                        flame. “The only
                        way to power for women is sorcery. Medea, Calypso, now there were powerful women! And me, of
                        course. The
                        greatest of all.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You... C.C.... Circe!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, my dear.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth backed up, and Circe laughed. “You need not worry. I mean you no
                        harm.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What have you done to Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Only helped him realize his true form.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth scanned the room. Finally she saw the cage, and me scratching at the
                        bars, all the
                        other guinea pigs crowding around me. Her eyes went wide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Forget him,” Circe said. “Join me and learn the ways of sorcery.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Your friend will be well cared for. He’ll be shipped to a wonderful new home
                        on the mainland.
                        The kindergartners will adore him. Meanwhile, you will be wise and powerful. You will have all
                        you ever wanted.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth was still staring at me, but she had a dreamy expression on her face.
                        She looked the
                        same way I had when Circe enchanted me into drinking the guinea pig milk shake. I squealed and
                        scratched, trying
                        to warn her to snap out of it, but I was absolutely powerless. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Let me think about it,” Annabeth murmured. “Just... give me a minute alone. To
                        say good-bye.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Of course, my dear,” Circe cooed. “One minute. Oh... and so you have absolute
                        privacy...” She waved
                        her hand and iron bars slammed down over the windows. She swept out of the room and I heard the
                        locks on the
                        door click shut behind her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The dreamy look melted off Annabeth’s face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She rushed over to my cage. “All right, which one is you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I squealed, but so did all the other guinea pigs. Annabeth looked desperate.
                        She scanned the
                        room and spotted the cuff of my jeans sticking out from under the loom. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Yes! </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She rushed over and rummaged through my pockets. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But instead of bringing out Riptide, she found the bottle of Hermes
                        multivitamins and started
                        struggling with the cap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to scream at her that this wasn’t the time for taking supplements! She
                        had to draw the
                        sword! </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She popped a lemon chewable in her mouth just as the door flew open and Circe
                        came back in,
                        flanked by two of her business-suited attendants. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well,” Circe sighed, “how fast a minute passes. What is your answer, my dear?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This,” Annabeth said, and she drew her bronze knife. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The sorceress stepped back, but her surprise quickly passed. She sneered.
                        “Really, little girl,
                        a knife against <i class="calibre5">my </i>magic? Is that wise?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Circe looked back at her attendants, who smiled. They raised their hands as if
                        preparing to
                        cast a spell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Run! </i>I wanted to tell Annabeth, but all I could make
                        were rodent
                        noises. The other guinea pigs squealed in terror and scuttled around the cage. I had the urge to
                        panic and hide,
                        too, but I had to think of something! I couldn’t stand to lose Annabeth the way I’d lost Tyson.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What will Annabeth’s makeover be?” Circe mused. “Something small and
                        ill-tempered. I know... a
                        shrew!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Blue fire coiled from her fingers curling like serpents around Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I watched, horror-struck, but nothing happened. Annabeth was still Annabeth,
                        only angrier. She
                        leaped forward and stuck the point of her knife against Circe’s neck. “How about turning me into
                        a panther
                        instead? One that has her claws at your throat!” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“How!” Circe yelped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth held up my bottle of vitamins for the sorceress to see. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Circe howled in frustration. “Curse Hermes and his multivitamins! Those are
                        such a fad! They do
                        <i class="calibre5">nothing </i>for you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Turn Percy back to a human or else!” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I can’t!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then you asked for it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Circe’s attendants stepped forward, but their mistress said, “Get back! She’s
                        immune to magic
                        until that cursed vitamin wears off.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth dragged Circe over to the guinea pig cage, knocked the top off, and
                        poured the rest of
                        the vitamins inside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Circe screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was the first to get a vitamin, but all the other guinea pigs scuttled out,
                        too, and checked
                        out this new food. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The first nibble, and I felt all fiery inside. I gnawed at the vitamin until it
                        stopped looking
                        so huge, and the cage got smaller, and then suddenly, <i class="calibre5">bang! </i>The cage
                        exploded. I was
                        sitting on the floor, a human again—somehow back in my regular clothes, thank the gods—with six
                        other guys who
                        all looked disoriented, blinking and shaking wood shavings out of their hair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Circe screamed. “You don’t understand! Those are the worst!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">One of the men stood up—a huge guy with a long tangled pitch-black beard and
                        teeth the same
                        color. He wore mismatched clothes of wool and leather, knee-length boots, and a floppy felt hat.
                        The other men
                        were dressed more simply—in breeches and stained white shirts. All of them were barefoot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Argggh!” bellowed the big man. “What’s the witch done t’me!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Circe moaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth gasped. “I recognize you! Edward Teach, son of Ares?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Aye, lass,” the big man growled. “Though most call me Blackbeard! And there’s
                        the sorceress
                        what captured us, lads. Run her through, and then I mean to find me a big bowl of celery!
                        Arggggh!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Circe screamed. She and her attendants ran from the room, chased by the
                        pirates. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth sheathed her knife and glared at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thanks...” I faltered. “I’m really sorry—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before I could figure out how to apologize for being such an idiot, she tackled
                        me with a hug,
                        then pulled away just as quickly. “I’m glad you’re not a guinea pig.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Me, too.” I hoped my face wasn’t as red as it felt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She undid the golden braids in her hair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come on, Seaweed Brain,” she said. “We have to get away while Circe’s
                        distracted.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We ran down the hillside through the terraces, past screaming spa workers and
                        pirates
                        ransacking the resort. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Blackbeard’s men broke the tiki torches for the luau, threw herbal wraps into
                        the swimming
                        pool, and kicked over tables of sauna towels. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I almost felt bad letting the unruly pirates out, but I guessed they deserved
                        something more
                        entertaining than the exercise wheel after being cooped up in a cage for three centuries. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Which ship?” Annabeth said as we reached the docks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked around desperately. We couldn’t very well take our rowboat. We had to
                        get off the
                        island fast, but what else could we use? A sub? A fighter jet? I couldn’t pilot any of those
                        things. And then I
                        saw it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth blinked. “But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I can make it work.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t explain. I just somehow knew an old sailing vessel was the best bet
                        for me. I
                        grabbed Annabeth’s hand and pulled her toward the three-mast ship. Painted on its prow was the
                        name that I would
                        only decipher later: <i class="calibre5">Queen Anne’s Revenge</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Argggh!” Blackbeard yelled somewhere behind us. “Those scalawags are
                        a-boarding me vessel! Get
                        ’em, lads!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll never get going in time!” Annabeth yelled as we climbed aboard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked around at the hopeless maze of sail and ropes. The ship was in great
                        condition for a
                        three-hundred-year old vessel, but it would still take a crew of fifty several hours to get
                        underway. We didn’t
                        have several hours. I could see the pirates running down the stairs, waving tiki torches and
                        sticks of celery.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I closed my eyes and concentrated on the waves lapping against the hull, the
                        ocean currents,
                        the winds all around me. Suddenly, the right word appeared in my mind. “Mizzenmast!” I yelled.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth looked at me like I was nuts, but in the next second, the air was
                        filled with
                        whistling sounds of ropes being snapped taut, canvases unfurling, and wooden pulleys creaking.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth ducked as a cable flew over her head and wrapped itself around the
                        bowsprit. “Percy,
                        how...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t have an answer, but I could feel the ship responding to me as if it
                        were part of my
                        body. I willed the sails to rise as easily as if I were flexing my arm. I willed the rudder to
                        turn.</p>

                        the pirates arrived at the water’s edge, we were already underway, sailing into the Sea of
                        Monsters. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">I’d finally found something I was really good at. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The <i class="calibre5">Queen Anne’s Revenge </i>responded to my every command.
                        I knew which
                        ropes to hoist, which sails to raise, which direction to steer. We plowed through the waves at
                        what I figured
                        was about ten knots. I even understood how fast that was. For a sailing ship, pretty darn fast.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It all felt perfect—the wind in my face, the waves breaking over the prow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But now that we were out of danger, all I could think about was how much I
                        missed Tyson, and
                        how worried I was about Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t get over how badly I’d messed up on Circe’s Island. If it hadn’t
                        been for Annabeth,
                        I’d still be a rodent, hiding in a hutch with a bunch of cute furry pirates. I thought about
                        what Circe had
                        said: <i class="calibre5">See, Percy? You’ve unlocked your true self! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I still felt changed. Not just because I had a sudden desire to eat lettuce. I
                        felt jumpy, like
                        the instinct to be a scared little animal was now a part of me. Or maybe it had always been
                        there. That’s what
                        really worried me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We sailed through the night. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth tried to help me keep lookout, but sailing didn’t agree with her.
                        After a few hours
                        rocking back and forth, her face turned the color of guacamole and she went below to lie in a
                        hammock. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I watched the horizon. More than once I spotted monsters. A plume of water as
                        tall as a
                        skyscraper spewed into the moonlight. A row of green spines slithered across the waves—something
                        maybe a hundred
                        feet long, reptilian. I didn’t really want to know. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Once I saw Nereids, the glowing lady spirits of the sea. I tried to wave at
                        them, but they
                        disappeared into the depths, leaving me unsure whether they’d seen me or not. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Sometime after midnight, Annabeth came up on deck. We were just passing a
                        smoking volcano
                        island. The sea bubbled and steamed around the shore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“One of the forges of Hephaestus,” Annabeth said. “Where he makes his metal
                        monsters.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Like the bronze bulls?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She nodded. “Go around. Far around.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t need to be told twice. We steered clear of the island, and soon it was
                        just a red
                        patch of haze behind us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at Annabeth. “The reason you hate Cyclopes so much... the story about
                        how
                        Thalia really
                        died. What happened?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was hard to see her expression in the dark. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I guess you deserve to know,” she said finally. “The night Grover was
                        escorting us to camp, he
                        got confused, took some wrong turns. You remember he told you that once?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, the worst wrong turn was into a Cyclops’s lair in Brooklyn.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They’ve got Cyclopes in Brooklyn?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You wouldn’t believe how many, but that’s not the point. This Cyclops, he
                        tricked us. He
                        managed to split us up inside this maze of corridors in an old house in Flatbush. And he could
                        sound like
                        anyone, Percy. Just the way Tyson did aboard the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>. He
                        lured us, one at
                        time. Thalia thought she was running to save Luke. Luke thought he heard me scream for help. And
                        me... I was alone
                        in the dark. I was seven years old. I couldn’t even find the exit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She brushed the hair out of her face. “I remember finding the main room. There
                        were bones all
                        over the floor. And there were Thalia and Luke and Grover, tied up and gagged, hanging from the
                        ceiling like
                        smoked hams. The Cyclops was starting a fire in the middle of the floor. I drew my knife, but he
                        heard me. He
                        turned and smiled. He spoke, and somehow he knew my dad’s voice. I guess he just plucked it out
                        of my mind. He
                        said, ‘Now, Annabeth, don’t you worry. I love you. You can stay here with me. You can stay
                        forever.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I shivered. The way she told it—even now, six years later—freaked me out worse
                        than any ghost
                        story I’d ever heard. “What did you do?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I stabbed him in the foot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at her. “Are you kidding? You were seven years old and you stabbed a
                        grown Cyclops in
                        the foot?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, he would’ve killed me. But I surprised him. It gave me just enough time to
                        run to Thalia
                        and cut the ropes on her hands. She took it from there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, but still... that was pretty brave, Annabeth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She shook her head. “We barely got out alive. I still have nightmares, Percy.
                        The way that
                        Cyclops talked in my father’s voice. It was his fault we took so long getting to camp. All the
                        monsters who’d
                        been chasing us had time to catch up. That’s really why Thalia died. If it hadn’t been for that
                        Cyclops, she’d
                        still be alive today.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Go below,” Annabeth told me at last. “You need some rest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded. My eyes were heavy. But when I got below and found a hammock, it took
                        me a long time
                        to fall asleep. I kept thinking about Annabeth’s story. I wondered, if I were her, would I have
                        had enough
                        courage to go on this quest, to sail straight toward the lair of another Cyclops? </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">I didn’t dream about Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Instead I found myself back in Luke’s stateroom aboard the <i

                        shadows. Voices
                        whispered all around me—spirits of the dead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Beware</i>, they whispered. <i class="calibre5">Traps.
                            Trickery</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Kronos’s golden sarcophagus glowed faintly—the only source of light in the
                        room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A cold laugh startled me. It seemed to come from miles below the ship. <i
                            class="calibre5">You
                            don’t have the courage, young one. You can’t stop me. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I knew what I had to do. I had to open that coffin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I uncapped Riptide. Ghosts whirled around me like a tornado. <i
                            class="calibre5">Beware! </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My heart pounded. I couldn’t make my feet move, but I had to stop Kronos. I had
                        to destroy
                        whatever was in that box. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then a girl spoke right next to me: “Well, Seaweed Brain?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked over, expecting to see Annabeth, but the girl wasn’t Annabeth. She
                        wore punk-style
                        clothes with silver chains on her wrists. She had spiky black hair, dark eyeliner around her
                        stormy blue eyes,
                        and a spray of freckles across her nose. She looked familiar, but I wasn’t sure why. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well?” she asked. “Are we going to stop him or not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t answer. I couldn’t move. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The girl rolled her eyes. “Fine. Leave it to me and Aegis.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She tapped her wrist and her silver chains transformed—flattening and expanding
                        into a huge
                        shield. It was silver and bronze, with the monstrous face of Medusa protruding from the center.
                        It looked like a
                        death mask, as if the gorgon’s real head had been pressed into the metal. I didn’t know if that
                        was true, or if
                        the shield could really petrify me, but I looked away. Just being near it made me cold with
                        fear. I got a
                        feeling that in a real fight, the bearer of that shield would be almost impossible to beat. Any
                        sane enemy would
                        turn and run. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The girl drew her sword and advanced on the sarcophagus. The shadowy ghosts
                        parted for her,
                        scattering before the terrible aura of her shield. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” I tried to warn her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But she didn’t listen. She marched straight up to the sarcophagus and pushed
                        aside the golden
                        lid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">For a moment she stood there, gazing down at whatever was in the box. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The coffin began to glow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No.” The girl’s voice trembled. “It can’t be.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">From the depths of the ocean, Kronos laughed so loudly the whole ship trembled.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” The girl screamed as the sarcophagus engulfed her in a blast of a golden
                        light. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah!” I sat bolt upright in my hammock. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth was shaking me. “Percy, you were having a nightmare. You need to get
                        up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wh—what is it?” I rubbed my eyes. “What’s wrong?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Land,” she said grimly. “We’re approaching the island of the Sirens.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I could barely make out the island ahead of us—just a dark spot in the mist.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I want you to do me a favor,” Annabeth said. “The Sirens... we’ll be in range
                        of
                        their singing
                        soon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I remembered stories about the Sirens. They sang so sweetly their voices
                        enchanted sailors and
                        lured them to their death. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No problem,” I assured her. “We can just stop up our ears. There’s a big tub
                        of candle wax
                        below deck—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I want to hear them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I blinked. “Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They say the Sirens sing the truth about what you desire. They tell you things
                        about yourself
                        you didn’t even realize. That’s what’s so enchanting. If you survive... you become wiser. I want
                        to
                        hear them. How
                        often will I get that chance?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Coming from most people, this would’ve made no sense. But Annabeth being who
                        she was—well, if
                        she could struggle through Ancient Greek architecture books and enjoy documentaries on the
                        History Channel, I
                        guessed the Sirens would appeal to her, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She told me her plan. Reluctantly, I helped her get ready. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As soon as the rocky coastline of the island came into view, I ordered one of
                        the ropes to wrap
                        around Annabeth’s waist, tying her to the foremast. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t untie me,” she said, “no matter what happens or how much I plead. I’ll
                        want to go
                        straight over the edge and drown myself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Are you trying to tempt me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ha-ha.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I promised I’d keep her secure. Then I took two large wads of candle wax,
                        kneaded them into
                        earplugs, and stuffed my ears. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/13-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth nodded sarcastically, letting me know the earplugs were a real fashion
                        statement. I
                        made a face at her and turned to the pilot’s wheel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The silence was eerie. I couldn’t hear anything but the rush of blood in my
                        head. As we
                        approached the island, jagged rocks loomed out of the fog. I willed the <i
                            class="calibre5">Queen Anne’s Revenge
                        </i>to skirt around them. If we sailed any closer, those rocks would shred our hull like blender
                        blades. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I glanced back. At first, Annabeth seemed totally normal. Then she got a
                        puzzled look on her
                        face. Her eyes widened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She strained against the ropes. She called my name—I could tell just from
                        reading her lips. Her
                        expression was clear: She had to get out. This was life or death. I had to let her out of the
                        ropes <i class="calibre5">right now</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She seemed so miserable it was hard not to cut her free. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I forced myself to look away. I urged the <i class="calibre5">Queen Anne’s
                            Revenge </i>to go
                        faster. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I still couldn’t see much of the island—just mist and rocks—but floating in the
                        water were
                        pieces of wood and fiberglass, the wreckage of old ships, even some flotation cushions from
                        airplanes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">How could music cause so many lives to veer off course? I mean, sure, there
                        were some Top Forty
                        songs that made me want to take a fiery nosedive, but still... What could the Sirens possibly
                        sing
                        about? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">For one dangerous moment, I understood Annabeth’s curiosity. I was tempted to
                        take out the
                        earplugs, just to get a taste of the song. I could feel the Sirens’ voices vibrating in the
                        timbers of the ship,
                        pulsing along with the roar of blood in my ears. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth was pleading with me. Tears streamed down her cheeks. She strained
                        against the ropes,
                        as if they were holding her back from everything she cared about. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">How could you be so cruel? </i>She seemed to be asking me.
                        <i class="calibre5">I thought you were my friend. </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I glared at the misty island. I wanted to uncap my sword, but there was nothing
                        to fight. How
                        do you fight a song? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried hard not to look at Annabeth. I managed it for about five minutes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That was my big mistake. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When I couldn’t stand it any longer, I looked back and found... a heap of cut
                        ropes. An empty
                        mast. Annabeth’s bronze knife lay on the deck. Somehow, she’d managed to wriggle it into her
                        hand. I’d totally
                        forgotten to disarm her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I rushed to the side of the boat and saw her, paddling madly for the island,
                        the waves carrying
                        her straight toward the jagged rocks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I screamed her name, but if she heard me, it didn’t do any good. She was
                        entranced, swimming
                        toward her death. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked back at the pilot’s wheel and yelled, “Stay!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I jumped over the side. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sliced into the water and willed the currents to bend around me, making a jet
                        stream that
                        shot me forward. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I came to the surface and spotted Annabeth, but a wave caught her, sweeping her
                        between two
                        razor-sharp fangs of rock. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I had no choice. I plunged after her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I dove under the wrecked hull of a yacht, wove through a collection of floating
                        metal balls on
                        chains that I realized afterward were mines. I had to use all my power over water to avoid
                        getting smashed
                        against the rocks or tangled in the nets of barbed wire strung just below the surface. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I jetted between the two rock fangs and found myself in a half-moon-shaped bay.
                        The water was
                        choked with more rocks and ship wreckage and floating mines. The beach was black volcanic sand.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked around desperately for Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There she was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luckily or unluckily, she was a strong swimmer. She’d made it past the mines
                        and the rocks. She
                        was almost to the black beach. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then the mist cleared and I saw them—the Sirens. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Imagine a flock of vultures the size of people—with dirty black plumage, gray
                        talons, and
                        wrinkled pink necks. Now imagine human heads on top of those necks, but the human heads keep
                        changing. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t hear them, but I could see they were singing. As their mouths moved,
                        their faces
                        morphed into people I knew—my mom, Poseidon, Grover, Tyson, Chiron. All the people I most wanted
                        to see. They
                        smiled reassuringly, inviting me forward. But no matter what shape they took, their mouths were
                        greasy and caked
                        with the remnants of old meals. Like vultures, they’d been eating with their faces, and it
                        didn’t look like
                        they’d been feasting on Monster Donuts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth swam toward them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I knew I couldn’t let her get out of the water. The sea was my only advantage.
                        It had always
                        protected me one way or another. I propelled myself forward and grabbed her ankle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The moment I touched her, a shock went through my body, and I saw the Sirens
                        the way Annabeth
                        must’ve been seeing them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Three people sat on a picnic blanket in Central Park. A feast was spread out
                        before them. I
                        recognized Annabeth’s dad from photos she’d shown me—an athletic-looking, sandy-haired guy in
                        his forties. He
                        was holding hands with a beautiful woman who looked a lot like Annabeth. She was dressed
                        casually—in blue jeans
                        and a denim shirt and hiking boots—but something about the woman radiated power. I knew that I
                        was looking at
                        the goddess Athena. Next to them sat a young man... Luke. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The whole scene glowed in a warm, buttery light. The three of them were talking
                        and laughing,
                        and when they saw Annabeth, their faces lit up with delight. Annabeth’s mom and dad held out
                        their arms
                        invitingly. Luke grinned and gestured for Annabeth to sit next to him—as if he’d never betrayed
                        her, as if he
                        were still her friend. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Behind the trees of Central Park, a city skyline rose. I caught my breath,
                        because it was
                        Manhattan, but <i class="calibre5">not </i>Manhattan. It had been totally rebuilt from dazzling
                        white marble,
                        bigger and grander than ever—with golden windows and rooftop gardens. It was better than New
                        York. Better than
                        Mount Olympus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I knew immediately that Annabeth had designed it all. She was the architect for
                        a whole new
                        world. She had reunited her parents. She had saved Luke. She had done everything she’d ever
                        wanted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I blinked hard. When I opened my eyes, all I saw were the Sirens—ragged
                        vultures with human
                        faces, ready to feed on another victim. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I pulled Annabeth back into the surf. I couldn’t hear her, but I could tell she
                        was screaming.
                        She kicked me in the face, but I held on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I willed the currents to carry us out into the bay. Annabeth pummeled and
                        kicked me, making it
                        hard to concentrate. She thrashed so much we almost collided with a floating mine. I didn’t know
                        what to do. I’d
                        never get back to the ship alive if she kept fighting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We went under and Annabeth stopped struggling. Her expression became confused.
                        Then our heads
                        broke the surface and she started to fight again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The water! Sound didn’t travel well underwater. If I could submerge her long
                        enough, I could
                        break the spell of the music. Of course, Annabeth wouldn’t be able to breathe, but at the
                        moment, that seemed
                        like a minor problem. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I grabbed her around the waist and ordered the waves to push us down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We shot into the depths—ten feet, twenty feet. I knew I had to be careful
                        because I could
                        withstand a lot more pressure than Annabeth. She fought and struggled for breath as bubbles rose
                        around us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Bubbles.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was desperate. I had to keep Annabeth alive. I imagined all the bubbles in
                        the sea—always
                        churning, rising. I imagined them coming together, being pulled toward me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The sea obeyed. There was a flurry of white, a tickling sensation all around
                        me, and when my
                        vision cleared, Annabeth and I had a huge bubble of air around us. Only our legs stuck into the
                        water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She gasped and coughed. Her whole body shuddered, but when she looked at me, I
                        knew the spell
                        had been broken. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She started to sob—I mean horrible, heartbroken sobbing. She put her head on my
                        shoulder and I
                        held her. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Fish gathered to look at us—a school of barracudas, some curious marlins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Scram! </i>I told them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They swam off, but I could tell they went reluctantly. I swear I understood
                        their intentions.
                        They were about to start rumors flying around the sea about the son of Poseidon and some girl at
                        the bottom of
                        Siren Bay. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll get us back to the ship,” I told her. “It’s okay. Just hang on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth nodded to let me know she was better now, then she murmured something
                        I couldn’t hear
                        because of the wax in my ears. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I made the current steer our weird little air submarine through the rocks and
                        barbed wire and
                        back toward the hull of the <i class="calibre5">Queen Anne’s Revenge</i>, which was maintaining
                        a slow and
                        steady course away from the island. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We stayed underwater, following the ship, until I judged we had moved out of
                        earshot of the
                        Sirens. Then I surfaced and our air bubble popped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I ordered a rope ladder to drop over the side of the ship, and we climbed
                        aboard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I kept my earplugs in, just to be sure. We sailed until the island was
                        completely out of sight.
                        Annabeth sat huddled in a blanket on the forward deck. Finally she looked up, dazed and sad, and
                        mouthed, <i class="calibre5">safe. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I took out the earplugs. No singing. The afternoon was quiet except for the
                        sound of the waves
                        against the hull. The fog had burned away to a blue sky, as if the island of the Sirens had
                        never existed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You okay?” I asked. The moment I said it, I realized how lame that sounded. Of
                        course she
                        wasn’t okay. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I didn’t realize,” she murmured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her eyes were the same color as the mist over the Sirens’ island. “How powerful
                        the temptation
                        would be.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t want to admit that I’d seen what the Sirens had promised her. I felt
                        like a
                        trespasser. But I figured I owed it to Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I saw the way you rebuilt Manhattan,” I told her. “And Luke and your parents.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She blushed. “You saw that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What Luke told you back on the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>,
                        about starting the
                        world from scratch... that really got to you, huh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pulled her blanket around her. “My fatal flaw. That’s what the Sirens
                        showed me. My fatal
                        flaw is hubris.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I blinked. “That brown stuff they spread on veggie sandwiches?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She rolled her eyes. “No, Seaweed Brain. That’s <i class="calibre5">hummus</i>.
                        Hubris is
                        worse.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What could be worse than hummus?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hubris means deadly pride, Percy. Thinking you can do things better than
                        anyone else... even the
                        gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You feel that way?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked down. “Don’t you ever feel like, what if the world really <i
                            class="calibre5">is
                        </i>messed up? What if we <i class="calibre5">could </i>do it all over again from scratch? No
                        more war. Nobody
                        homeless. No more summer reading homework.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m listening.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I mean, the West represents a lot of the best things mankind ever did—that’s
                        why the fire is
                        still burning. That’s why Olympus is still around. But sometimes you just see the bad stuff, you
                        know? And you
                        start thinking the way Luke does: ‘If I could tear this all down, I would do it better.’ Don’t
                        you ever feel
                        that way? Like <i class="calibre5">you </i>could do a better job if you ran the world?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um... no. Me running the world would kind of be a nightmare.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then you’re lucky. Hubris isn’t your fatal flaw.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What is?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t know, Percy, but every hero has one. If you don’t find it and learn to
                        control
                        it... well, they don’t call it ‘fatal’ for nothing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought about that. It didn’t exactly cheer me up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I also noticed Annabeth hadn’t said much about the <i
                            class="calibre5">per</i><i class="calibre5">sonal </i>things she would change—like getting
                        her parents back together, or saving Luke. I
                        understood. I didn’t want to admit how many times I’d dreamed of getting my own parents back
                        together. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I pictured my mom, alone in our little apartment on the Upper East Side. I
                        tried to remember
                        the smell of her blue waffles in the kitchen. It seemed so far away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So was it worth it?” I asked Annabeth. “Do you feel... wiser?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She gazed into the distance. “I’m not sure. But we <i class="calibre5">have
                        </i>to save the
                        camp. If we don’t stop Luke...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She didn’t need to finish. If Luke’s way of thinking could even tempt Annabeth,
                        there was no
                        telling how many other half-bloods might join him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought about my dream of the girl and the golden sarcophagus. I wasn’t sure
                        what it meant,
                        but I got the feeling I was missing something. Something terrible that Kronos was planning. What
                        had the girl
                        seen when she opened that coffin lid? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Suddenly Annabeth’s eyes widened. “Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Up ahead was another blotch of land—a saddle-shaped island with forested hills
                        and white
                        beaches and green meadows—just like I’d seen in my dreams. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My nautical senses confirmed it. 30 degrees, 31 minutes north, 75 degrees, 12
                        minutes west.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We had reached the home of the Cyclops. </p>

                        the beach like
                        the island of the Sirens. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Cyclops’s island was nothing like that. I mean, okay, it had a rope bridge
                        across a chasm,
                        which was not a good sign. You might as well put up a billboard that said, <small
                            class="calibre4">SOMETHING
                            EVIL LIVES HERE</small>. But except for that, the place looked like a Caribbean postcard. It
                        had green
                        fields and tropical fruit trees and white beaches. As we sailed toward the shore, Annabeth
                        breathed in the sweet
                        air. “The Fleece,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I nodded. I couldn’t see the Fleece yet, but I could feel its power. I could
                        believe it would
                        heal anything, even Thalia’s poisoned tree. “If we take it away, will the island die?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth shook her head. “It’ll fade. Go back to what it would be normally,
                        whatever that is.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I felt a little guilty about ruining this paradise, but I reminded myself we
                        had no choice.
                        Camp Half-Blood was in trouble. And Tyson... Tyson would still be with us if it wasn’t for this
                        quest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In the meadow at the base of the ravine, several dozen sheep were milling
                        around. They looked
                        peaceful enough, but they were huge—the size of hippos. Just past them was a path that led up
                        into the hills. At
                        the top of the path, near the edge of the canyon, was the massive oak tree I’d seen in my
                        dreams. Something gold
                        glittered in its branches. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“This is too easy,” I said. “We could just hike up there and take it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth’s eyes narrowed. “There’s supposed be a guardian. A dragon or...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That’s when a deer emerged from the bushes. It trotted into the meadow,
                        probably looking for
                        grass to eat, when the sheep all bleated at once and rushed the animal. It happened so fast that
                        the deer
                        stumbled and was lost in a sea of wool and trampling hooves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grass and tufts of fur flew into the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A second later the sheep all moved away, back to their regular peaceful
                        wanderings. Where the
                        deer had been was a pile of clean white bones. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and I exchanged looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They’re like piranhas,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Piranhas with wool. How will we—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Annabeth gasped, grabbing my arm. “Look.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pointed down the beach, to just below the sheep meadow, where a small boat
                        had been run
                        aground... the other lifeboat from the CSS <i class="calibre5">Birmingham</i>. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">We decided there was no way we could get past the man-eating sheep. Annabeth
                        wanted to sneak up
                        the path invisibly and grab the Fleece, but in the end I convinced her that something would go
                        wrong. The sheep
                        would smell her. Another guardian would appear. Something. And if that happened, I’d be too far
                        away to help.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Besides, our first job was to find Grover and whoever had come ashore in that
                        lifeboat—assuming
                        they’d gotten past the sheep. I was too nervous to say what I was secretly hoping... that Tyson
                        might still be
                        alive. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We moored the <i class="calibre5">Queen Anne’s Revenge </i>on the back side of
                        the island where
                        the cliffs rose straight up a good two hundred feet. I figured the ship was less likely to be
                        seen there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The cliffs looked climbable, barely—about as difficult as the lava wall back at
                        camp. At least
                        it was free of sheep. I hoped that Polyphemus did not also keep carnivorous mountain goats. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We rowed a lifeboat to the edge of the rocks and made our way up, very slowly.
                        Annabeth went
                        first because she was the better climber. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We only came close to dying six or seven times, which I thought was pretty
                        good. Once, I lost
                        my grip and I found myself dangling by one hand from a ledge fifty feet above the rocky surf.
                        But I found
                        another handhold and kept climbing. A minute later Annabeth hit a slippery patch of moss and her
                        foot slipped.
                        Fortunately, she found something else to put it against. Unfortunately, that something was my
                        face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry,” she murmured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“S’okay,” I grunted, though I’d never really wanted to know what Annabeth’s
                        sneaker tasted
                        like. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally, when my fingers felt like molten lead and my arm muscles were shaking
                        from exhaustion,
                        we hauled ourselves over the top of the cliff and collapsed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ugh,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ouch,” moaned Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Garrr!” bellowed another voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">If I hadn’t been so tired, I would’ve leaped another two hundred feet. I
                        whirled around, but I
                        couldn’t see who’d spoken. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth clamped her hand over my mouth. She pointed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The ledge we were sitting on was narrower than I’d realized. It dropped off on
                        the opposite
                        side, and that’s where the voice was coming from—right below us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re a feisty one!” the deep voice bellowed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Challenge me!” Clarisse’s voice, no doubt about it. “Give me back my sword and
                        I’ll fight
                        you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The monster roared with laughter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and I crept to the edge. We were right above the entrance of the
                        Cyclops’s cave. Below
                        us stood Polyphemus and Grover, still in his wedding dress. Clarisse was tied up, hanging upside
                        down over a pot
                        of boiling water. I was half hoping to see Tyson down there, too. Even if he’d been in danger,
                        at least I
                        would’ve known he was alive. But there was no sign of him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hmm,” Polyphemus pondered. “Eat loudmouth girl now or wait for wedding feast?
                        What does my
                        bride think?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He turned to Grover, who backed up and almost tripped over his completed bridal
                        train. “Oh, um,
                        I’m not hungry right now, dear. Perhaps—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Did you say <i class="calibre5">bride</i>?” Clarisse demanded. “Who—Grover?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Next to me, Annabeth muttered, “Shut up. She has to shut up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus glowered. “What ‘Grover’?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The satyr!” Clarisse yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh!” Grover yelped. “The poor thing’s brain is boiling from that hot water.
                        Pull her down,
                        dear!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus’s eyelids narrowed over his baleful milky eye, as if he were trying
                        to see Clarisse
                        more clearly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Cyclops was an even more horrible sight than he had been in my dreams.
                        Partly because his
                        rancid smell was now up close and personal. Partly because he was dressed in his wedding
                        outfit—a crude kilt and
                        shoulder-wrap, stitched together from baby-blue tuxedoes, as if he’d skinned an entire wedding
                        party. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What satyr?” asked Polyphemus. “Satyrs are good eating. You bring me a satyr?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, you big idiot!” bellowed Clarisse. “<i class="calibre5">That </i>satyr!
                        Grover! The one in
                        the wedding dress!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to wring Clarisse’s neck, but it was too late. All I could do was
                        watch as Polyphemus
                        turned and ripped off Grover’s wedding veil—revealing his curly hair, his scruffy adolescent
                        beard, his tiny
                        horns. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/14-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus breathed heavily, trying to contain his anger. “I don’t see very
                        well,” he growled.
                        “Not since many years ago when the other hero stabbed me in eye. But YOU’RE—NO—LADY—CYCLOPS!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Cyclops grabbed Grover’s dress and tore it away. Underneath, the old Grover
                        reappeared in
                        his jeans and T-shirt. He yelped and ducked as the monster swiped over his head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stop!” Grover pleaded. “Don’t eat me raw! I—I have a good recipe!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I reached for my sword, but Annabeth hissed, “Wait!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus was hesitating, a boulder in his hand, ready to smash his would-be
                        bride. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Recipe?” he asked Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh y-yes! You don’t want to eat me raw. You’ll get E coli and botulism and all
                        sorts of
                        horrible things. I’ll taste much better grilled over a slow fire. With mango chutney! You could
                        go get some
                        mangos right now, down there in the woods. I’ll just wait here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The monster pondered this. My heart hammered against my ribs. I figured I’d die
                        if I charged.
                        But I couldn’t let the monster kill Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grilled satyr with mango chutney,” Polyphemus mused. He looked back at
                        Clarisse, still hanging
                        over the pot of boiling water. “You a satyr, too?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, you overgrown pile of dung!” she yelled. “I’m a girl! The daughter of
                        Ares! Now untie me
                        so I can rip your arms off!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Rip my arms off,” Polyphemus repeated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And stuff them down your throat!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You got spunk.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Let me down!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/14-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus snatched up Grover as if he were a wayward puppy. “Have to graze
                        sheep now. Wedding
                        postponed until tonight. Then we’ll eat satyr for the main course!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But... you’re still getting married?” Grover sounded hurt. “Who’s the bride?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus looked toward the boiling pot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse made a strangled sound. “Oh, no! You can’t be serious. I’m not—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before Annabeth or I could do anything, Polyphemus plucked her off the rope
                        like she was a ripe
                        apple, and tossed her and Grover deep into the cave. “Make yourself comfortable! I come back at
                        sundown for big
                        event!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then the Cyclops whistled, and a mixed flock of goats and sheep—smaller than
                        the
                        man-eaters—flooded out of the cave and past their master. As they went to pasture, Polyphemus
                        patted some on the
                        back and called them by name—Beltbuster, Tammany, Lockhart, etc. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When the last sheep had waddled out, Polyphemus rolled a boulder in front of
                        the doorway as
                        easily as I would close a refrigerator door, shutting off the sound of Clarisse and Grover
                        screaming inside.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mangos,” Polyphemus grumbled to himself. “What are mangos?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He strolled off down the mountain in his baby-blue groom’s outfit, leaving us
                        alone with a pot
                        of boiling water and a six-ton boulder. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">We tried for what seemed like hours, but it was no good. The boulder wouldn’t
                        move. We yelled
                        into the cracks, tapped on the rock, did everything we could think of to get a signal to Grover,
                        but if he heard
                        us, we couldn’t tell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Even if by some miracle we managed to kill Polyphemus, it wouldn’t do us any
                        good. Grover and
                        Clarisse would die inside that sealed cave. The only way to move the rock was to have the
                        Cyclops do it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In total frustration, I stabbed Riptide against the boulder. Sparks flew, but
                        nothing else
                        happened. A large rock is not the kind of enemy you can fight with a magic sword. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and I sat on the ridge in despair and watched the distant baby-blue
                        shape of the
                        Cyclops as he moved among his flocks. He had wisely divided his regular animals from his
                        man-eating sheep,
                        putting each group on either side of the huge crevice that divided the island. The only way
                        across was the rope
                        bridge, and the planks were much too far apart for sheep hooves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We watched as Polyphemus visited his carnivorous flock on the far side.
                        Unfortunately, they
                        didn’t eat him. In fact, they didn’t seem to bother him at all. He fed them chunks of mystery
                        meat from a great
                        wicker basket, which only reinforced the feelings I’d been having since Circe turned me into a
                        guinea pig—that
                        maybe it was time I joined Grover and became a vegetarian. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Trickery,” Annabeth decided. “We can’t beat him by force, so we’ll have to use
                        trickery.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Okay,” I said. “What trick?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I haven’t figured that part out yet.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Great.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Polyphemus will have to move the rock to let the sheep inside.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“At sunset,” I said. “Which is when he’ll marry Clarisse and have Grover for
                        dinner. I’m not
                        sure which is grosser.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I could get inside,” she said, “invisibly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What about me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The sheep,” Annabeth mused. She gave me one of those sly looks that always
                        made me wary. “How
                        much do you like sheep?” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">“Just don’t let go!” Annabeth said, standing invisibly somewhere off to my
                        right. That was easy
                        for her to say. She wasn’t hanging upside down from the belly of a sheep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Now, I’ll admit it wasn’t as hard as I’d thought. I’d crawled under a car
                        before to change my
                        mom’s oil, and this wasn’t too different. The sheep didn’t care. Even the Cyclops’s smallest
                        sheep were big
                        enough to support my weight, and they had thick wool. I just twirled the stuff into handles for
                        my hands, hooked
                        my feet against the sheep’s thigh bones, and presto—I felt like a baby wallaby, riding around
                        against the
                        sheep’s chest, trying to keep the wool out of my mouth and my nose. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/14-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">In case you’re wondering, the underside of a sheep doesn’t smell that great.
                        Imagine a winter
                        sweater that’s been dragged through the mud and left in the laundry hamper for a week. Something
                        like that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The sun was going down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">No sooner was I in position than the Cyclops roared, “Oy! Goaties! Sheepies!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The flock dutifully began trudging back up the slopes toward the cave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This is it!” Annabeth whispered. “I’ll be close by. Don’t worry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I made a silent promise to the gods that if we survived this, I’d tell Annabeth
                        she was a
                        genius. The frightening thing was, I knew the gods would hold me to it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My sheep taxi started plodding up the hill. After a hundred yards, my hands and
                        feet started to
                        hurt from holding on. I gripped the sheep’s wool more tightly, and the animal made a grumbling
                        sound. I didn’t
                        blame it. I wouldn’t want anybody rock climbing in my hair either. But if I didn’t hold on, I
                        was sure I’d fall
                        off right there in front of the monster. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hasenpfeffer!” the Cyclops said, patting one of the sheep in front of me.
                        “Einstein! Widget—eh
                        there, Widget!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus patted my sheep and nearly knocked me to the ground. “Putting on
                        some extra mutton
                        there?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Uh-oh</i>, I thought. <i class="calibre5">Here it comes.
                        </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But Polyphemus just laughed and swatted the sheep’s rear end, propelling us
                        forward. “Go on,
                        fatty! Soon Polyphemus will eat you for breakfast!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And just like that, I was in the cave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I could see the last of the sheep coming inside. If Annabeth didn’t pull off
                        her distraction
                        soon... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Cyclops was about to roll the stone back into place, when from somewhere
                        outside Annabeth
                        shouted, “Hello, ugly!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus stiffened. “Who said that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nobody!” Annabeth yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That got exactly the reaction she’d been hoping for. The monster’s face turned
                        red with rage.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nobody!” Polyphemus yelled back. “I remember you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re too stupid to remember anybody,” Annabeth taunted. “Much less Nobody.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hoped to the gods she was already moving when she said that, because
                        Polyphemus bellowed
                        furiously, grabbed the nearest boulder (which happened to be his front door) and threw it toward
                        the sound of
                        Annabeth’s voice. I heard the rock smash into a thousand fragments. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">For a terrible moment, there was silence. Then Annabeth shouted, “You haven’t
                        learned to throw
                        any better, either!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus howled. “Come here! Let me kill you, Nobody!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You can’t kill Nobody, you stupid oaf,” she taunted. “Come find me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus barreled down the hill toward her voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Now, the “Nobody” thing wouldn’t have made sense to anybody, but Annabeth had
                        explained to me
                        that it was the name Odysseus had used to trick Polyphemus centuries ago, right before he poked
                        the Cyclops’s
                        eye out with a large hot stick. Annabeth had figured Polyphemus would still have a grudge about
                        that name, and
                        she was right. In his frenzy to find his old enemy, he forgot about resealing the cave entrance.
                        Apparently, he
                        didn’t even stop to consider that Annabeth’s voice was female, whereas the first Nobody had been
                        male. On the
                        other hand, he’d wanted to marry Grover, so he couldn’t have been all that bright about the
                        whole male/female
                        thing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I just hoped Annabeth could stay alive and keep distracting him long enough for
                        me to find
                        Grover and Clarisse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I dropped off my ride, patted Widget on the head, and apologized. I searched
                        the main room, but
                        there was no sign of Grover or Clarisse. I pushed through the crowd of sheep and goats toward
                        the back of the
                        cave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Even though I’d dreamed about this place, I had a hard time finding my way
                        through the maze. I
                        ran down corridors littered with bones, past rooms full of sheepskin rugs and life-size cement
                        sheep that I
                        recognized as the work of Medusa. There were collections of sheep T-shirts; large tubs of
                        lanolin cream; and
                        wooly coats, socks, and hats with ram’s horns. Finally, I found the spinning room, where Grover
                        was huddled in
                        the corner, trying to cut Clarisse’s bonds with a pair of safety scissors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s no good,” Clarisse said. “This rope is like iron!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Just a few more minutes!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grover,” she cried, exasperated. “You’ve been working at it for hours!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And then they saw me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Percy? </i>” Clarisse said. “You’re supposed to be blown
                        up!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Good to see you, too. Now hold still while I—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Perrrrrcy!” Grover bleated and tackled me with a goat-hug. “You heard me! You
                        came!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/14-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, buddy,” I said. “Of course I came.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Where’s Annabeth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Outside,” I said. “But there’s no time to talk. Clarisse, hold still.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I uncapped Riptide and sliced off her ropes. She stood stiffly, rubbing her
                        wrists. She glared
                        at me for a moment, then looked at the ground and mumbled, “Thanks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re welcome,” I said. “Now, was anyone else on board your lifeboat?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse looked surprised. “No. Just me. Everybody else aboard the <i
                            class="calibre5">Birmingham </i>... well, I didn’t even know you guys made it out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked down, trying not to believe that my last hope of seeing Tyson alive
                        had just been
                        crushed. “Okay. Come on, then. We have to help—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">An explosion echoed through the cave, followed by a scream that told me we
                        might be too late.
                        It was Annabeth crying out in fear. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">“I got Nobody!” Polyphemus gloated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We crept to the cave entrance and saw the Cyclops, grinning wickedly, holding
                        up empty air. The
                        monster shook his fist, and a baseball cap fluttered to the ground. There was Annabeth, hanging
                        upside down by
                        her legs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hah!” the Cyclops said. “Nasty invisible girl! Already got feisty one for
                        wife. Means you
                        gotta be grilled with mango chutney!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth struggled, but she looked dazed. She had a nasty cut on her forehead.
                        Her eyes were
                        glassy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll rush him,” I whispered to Clarisse. “Our ship is around the back of the
                        island. You and
                        Grover—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No way,” they said at the same time. Clarisse had armed herself with a highly
                        collectible
                        ram’s-horn spear from the Cyclops’s cave. Grover had found a sheep’s thigh bone, which he didn’t
                        look too happy
                        about, but he was gripping it like a club, ready to attack. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll take him together,” Clarisse growled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” Grover said. Then he blinked, like he couldn’t believe he’d just agreed
                        with Clarisse
                        about something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right,” I said. “Attack plan Macedonia.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They nodded. We’d all taken the same training courses at Camp Half-Blood. They
                        knew what I was
                        talking about. They would sneak around either side and attack the Cyclops from the flanks while
                        I held his
                        attention in the front. Probably what this meant was that we’d <i class="calibre5">all </i>die
                        instead of just
                        me, but I was grateful for the help. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">I hefted my sword and shouted, “Hey, Ugly!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The giant whirled toward me. “<i class="calibre5">Another </i>one? Who are

                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s right, you smelly bucket of nose drool!” It didn’t sound quite as good
                        as Annabeth’s
                        insults, but it was all I could think of. “I’m Nobody and I’m proud of it! Now, put her down and
                        get over here.
                        I want to stab your eye out again.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“RAAAR!” he bellowed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The good news: he dropped Annabeth. The bad news: he dropped her headfirst onto
                        the rocks,
                        where she lay motionless as a rag doll. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The other bad news: Polyphemus barreled toward me, a thousand smelly pounds of
                        Cyclops that I
                        would have to fight with a very small sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“For Pan!” Grover rushed in from the right. He threw his sheep bone, which
                        bounced harmlessly
                        off the monster’s forehead. Clarisse ran in from the left and set her spear against the ground
                        just in time for
                        the Cyclops to step on it. He wailed in pain, and Clarisse dove out of the way to avoid getting
                        trampled. But
                        the Cyclops just plucked out the shaft like a large splinter and kept advancing on me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I moved in with Riptide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The monster made a grab for me. I rolled aside and stabbed him in the thigh.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was hoping to see him disintegrate, but this monster was much too big and
                        powerful. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get Annabeth!” I yelled at Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He rushed over, grabbed her invisibility cap, and picked her up while Clarisse
                        and I tried to
                        keep Polyphemus distracted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I have to admit, Clarisse was brave. She charged the Cyclops again and again.
                        He pounded the
                        ground, stomped at her, grabbed at her, but she was too quick. And as soon as she made an
                        attack, I followed up
                        by stabbing the monster in the toe or the ankle or the hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But we couldn’t keep this up forever. Eventually we would tire or the monster
                        would get in a
                        lucky shot. It would only take one hit to kill us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Grover carrying Annabeth across the rope
                        bridge. It wouldn’t
                        have been my first choice, given the man-eating sheep on the other side, but at the moment that
                        looked better
                        than <i class="calibre5">this </i>side of the chasm, and it gave me an idea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Fall back!” I told Clarisse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She rolled away as the Cyclops’s fist smashed the olive tree beside her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We ran for the bridge, Polyphemus right behind us. He was cut up and hobbling
                        from so many
                        wounds, but all we’d done was slow him down and make him mad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grind you into sheep chow!” he promised. “A thousand curses on Nobody!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Faster!” I told Clarisse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We tore down the hill. The bridge was our only chance. Grover had just made it
                        to the other
                        side and was setting Annabeth down. We had to make it across, too, before the giant caught us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grover!” I yelled. “Get Annabeth’s knife!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His eyes widened when he saw the Cyclops behind us, but he nodded like he
                        understood. As
                        Clarisse and I scrambled across the bridge, Grover began sawing at the ropes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The first strand went <i class="calibre5">snap! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus bounded after us, making the bridge sway wildly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The ropes were now half cut. Clarisse and I dove for solid ground, landing
                        beside Grover. I
                        made a wild slash with my sword and cut the remaining ropes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The bridge fell away into the chasm, and the Cyclops howled... with delight,
                        because he was
                        standing right next to us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Failed!” he yelled gleefully. “Nobody failed!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse and Grover tried to charge him, but the monster swatted them aside
                        like flies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My anger swelled. I couldn’t believe I’d come this far, lost Tyson, suffered
                        through so much,
                        only to fail—stopped by a big stupid monster in a baby-blue tuxedo kilt. Nobody was going to
                        swat down my
                        friends like that! I mean... <i class="calibre5">nobody</i>, not Nobody. Ah, you know what I
                        mean.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Strength coursed through my body. I raised my sword and attacked, forgetting
                        that I was
                        hopelessly outmatched. I jabbed the Cyclops in the belly. When he doubled over I smacked him in
                        the nose with
                        the hilt of my sword. I slashed and kicked and bashed until the next thing I knew, Polyphemus
                        was sprawled on
                        his back, dazed and groaning, and I was standing above him, the tip of my sword hovering over
                        his eye. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uhhhhhhhh,” Polyphemus moaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Grover gasped. “How did you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Please, noooo!” the Cyclops moaned, pitifully staring up at me. His nose was
                        bleeding. A tear
                        welled in the corner of his half-blind eye. “M-m-my sheepies need me. Only trying to protect my
                        sheep!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He began to sob. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I had won. All I had to do was stab—one quick strike. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Kill him!” Clarisse yelled. “What are you waiting for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Cyclops sounded so heartbroken, just like... like Tyson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He’s a Cyclops!” Grover warned. “Don’t trust him!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I knew he was right. I knew Annabeth would’ve said the same thing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But Polyphemus sobbed... and for the first time it sank in that <i
                            class="calibre5">he </i>was a
                        son of Poseidon, too. Like Tyson. Like me. How could I just kill him in cold blood? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We only want the Fleece,” I told the monster. “Will you agree to let us take
                        it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Clarisse shouted. “Kill him!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The monster sniffed. “My beautiful Fleece. Prize of my collection. Take it,
                        cruel human. Take
                        it and go in peace.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m going to step back slowly,” I told the monster. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“One false move...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus nodded like he understood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stepped back... and as fast as a cobra, Polyphemus smacked me to the edge of
                        the
                        cliff. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Foolish mortal!” he bellowed, rising to his feet. “Take my Fleece? Ha! I eat
                        you first.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He opened his enormous mouth, and I knew that his rotten molars were the last
                        things I would
                        ever see. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then something went <i class="calibre5">whoosh </i>over my head and <i
                            class="calibre5">thump!
                        </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A rock the size of a basketball sailed into Polyphemus’s throat—a beautiful
                        three-pointer,
                        nothing but net. The Cyclops choked, trying to swallow the unexpected pill. He staggered
                        backward, but there was
                        no place to stagger. His heel slipped, the edge of the cliff crumbled, and the great Polyphemus
                        made chicken
                        wing motions that did nothing to help him fly as he tumbled into the chasm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Halfway down the path to the beach, standing completely unharmed in the midst
                        of a flock of
                        killer sheep, was an old friend. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“Bad Polyphemus,” Tyson said. “Not all Cyclopes as nice as we look.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Tyson gave us the short version: Rainbow the hippocampus—who’d apparently been
                        following us
                        ever since the Long Island Sound, waiting for Tyson to play with him—had found Tyson sinking
                        beneath the
                        wreckage of the CSS <i class="calibre5">Birmingham </i>and pulled him to safety. He and Tyson
                        had been searching
                        the Sea of Monsters ever since, trying to find us, until Tyson caught the scent of sheep and
                        found this island.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to hug the big oaf, except he was standing in the middle of killer
                        sheep. “Tyson,
                        thank the gods. Annabeth is hurt!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You thank the gods she is hurt?” he asked, puzzled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” I knelt beside Annabeth and was worried sick by what I saw. The gash on
                        her forehead was
                        worse than I’d realized. Her hairline was sticky with blood. Her skin was pale and clammy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover and I exchanged nervous looks. Then an idea came to me. “Tyson, the
                        Fleece. Can you get
                        it for me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Which one?” Tyson said, looking around at the hundreds of sheep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“In the tree!” I said. “The gold one!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh. Pretty. Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson lumbered over, careful not to step on the sheep. If any of us had tried
                        to approach the
                        Fleece, we would’ve been eaten alive, but I guess Tyson smelled like Polyphemus, because the
                        flock didn’t bother
                        him at all. They just cuddled up to him and bleated affectionately, as though they expected to
                        get sheep treats
                        from the big wicker basket. Tyson reached up and lifted the Fleece off its branch. Immediately
                        the leaves on the
                        oak tree turned yellow. Tyson started wading back toward me, but I yelled, “No time! Throw it!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The gold ram skin sailed through the air like a glittering shag Frisbee. I
                        caught it with a
                        grunt. It was heavier than I’d expected—sixty or seventy pounds of precious gold wool. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I spread it over Annabeth, covering everything but her face, and prayed
                        silently to all the
                        gods I could think of, even the ones I didn’t like. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Please. Please.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The color returned to her face. Her eyelids fluttered open. The cut on her
                        forehead began to
                        close. She saw Grover and said weakly, “You’re not... married?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover grinned. “No. My friends talked me out of it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth,” I said, “just lay still.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But despite our protests she sat up, and I noticed that the cut on her face was
                        almost
                        completely healed. She looked a lot better. In fact, she shimmered with health, as if someone
                        had injected her
                        with glitter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Meanwhile, Tyson was starting to have trouble with the sheep. “Down!” he told
                        them as they
                        tried to climb him, looking for food. A few were sniffing in our direction. “No, sheepies. This
                        way! Come here!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They heeded him, but it was obvious they were hungry, and they were starting to
                        realize Tyson
                        didn’t have any treats for them. They wouldn’t hold out forever with so much fresh meat nearby.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We have to go,” I said. “Our ship is. . .” The <i class="calibre5">Queen
                            Anne’s Revenge
                        </i>was a very long way away. The shortest route was across the chasm, and we’d just destroyed
                        the only bridge.
                        The only other possibility was through the sheep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson,” I called, “can you lead the flock as far away as possible?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The sheep want food.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know! They want people food! Just lead them away from the path. Give us time
                        to get to the
                        beach. Then join us there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson looked doubtful, but he whistled. “Come, sheepies! Um, people food this
                        way!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He jogged off into the meadow, the sheep in pursuit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Keep the Fleece around you,” I told Annabeth. “Just in case you’re not fully
                        healed yet. Can
                        you stand?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She tried, but her face turned pale again. “Ohh. <i class="calibre5">Not
                        </i>fully healed.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse dropped next to her and felt her chest, which made Annabeth gasp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ribs broken,” Clarisse said. “They’re mending, but definitely broken.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How can you tell?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse glared at me. “Because I’ve broken a few, runt! I’ll have to carry
                        her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before I could argue, Clarisse picked up Annabeth like a sack of flour and
                        lugged her down to
                        the beach. Grover and I followed. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">As soon as we got to the edge of the water, I concentrated on the <i
                            class="calibre5">Queen
                            Anne’s Revenge</i>. I willed it to raise anchor and come to me. After a few anxious minutes,
                        I saw the ship
                        rounding the tip of the island. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Incoming!” Tyson yelled. He was bounding down the path to join us, the sheep
                        about fifty yards
                        behind, bleating in frustration as their Cyclops friend ran away without feeding them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They probably won’t follow us into the water,” I told the others. “All we have
                        to do is swim
                        for the ship.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“With Annabeth like this?” Clarisse protested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We can do it,” I insisted. I was starting to feel confident again. I was back
                        in my home
                        turf—the sea. “Once we get to the ship, we’re home free.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We almost made it, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were just wading past the entrance to the ravine, when we heard a tremendous
                        roar and saw
                        Polyphemus, scraped up and bruised but still very much alive, his baby-blue wedding outfit in
                        tatters, splashing
                        toward us with a boulder in each hand. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">“You’d think he’d run out of rocks,” I muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Swim for it!” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He and Clarisse plunged into the surf. Annabeth hung on to Clarisse’s neck and
                        tried to paddle
                        with one hand, the wet Fleece weighing her down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But the monster’s attention wasn’t on the Fleece. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You, young Cyclops!” Polyphemus roared. “Traitor to your kind!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson froze. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t listen to him!” I pleaded. “Come on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I pulled Tyson’s arm, but I might as well have been pulling a mountain. He
                        turned and faced the
                        older Cyclops. “I am not a traitor.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You serve mortals!” Polyphemus shouted. “Thieving humans!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus threw his first boulder. Tyson swatted it aside with his fist. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not a traitor,” Tyson said. “And you are <i class="calibre5">not </i>my kind.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Death or victory!” Polyphemus charged into the surf, but his foot was still
                        wounded. He
                        immediately stumbled and fell on his face. That would’ve been funny, except he started to get up
                        again, spitting
                        salt water and growling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Clarisse yelled. “Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They were almost to the ship with the Fleece. If I could just keep the monster
                        distracted a
                        little longer... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Go,” Tyson told me. “I will hold Big Ugly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No! He’ll kill you.” I’d already lost Tyson once. I wasn’t going to lose him
                        again. “We’ll
                        fight him together.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Together,” Tyson agreed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I drew my sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus advanced carefully, limping worse than ever. But there was nothing
                        wrong with his
                        throwing arm. He chucked his second boulder. I dove to one side, but I still would’ve been
                        squashed if Tyson’s
                        fist hadn’t blasted the rock to rubble. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I willed the sea to rise. A twenty-foot wave surged up, lifting me on its
                        crest. I rode toward
                        the Cyclops and kicked him in the eye, leaping over his head as the water blasted him onto the
                        beach. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Destroy you!” Polyphemus spluttered. “Fleece stealer!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">You </i>stole the Fleece!” I yelled. “You’ve been using it
                        to lure satyrs
                        to their deaths!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So? Satyrs good eating!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Fleece should be used to heal! It belongs to the children of the gods!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">I </i>am a child of the gods!” Polyphemus swiped at me,
                        but I sidestepped.
                        “Father Poseidon, curse this thief!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He was blinking hard now, like he could barely see, and I realized he was
                        targeting by the
                        sound of my voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Poseidon won’t curse me,” I said, backing up as the Cyclops grabbed air. “I’m
                        his son, too. He
                        won’t play favorites.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus roared. He ripped an olive tree out of the side of the cliff and
                        smashed it where
                        I’d been standing a moment before. “Humans not the same! Nasty, tricky, lying!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover was helping Annabeth aboard the ship. Clarisse was waving frantically at
                        me, telling me
                        to come on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson worked his way around Polyphemus, trying to get behind him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Young one!” the older Cyclops called. “Where are you? Help me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson stopped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You weren’t raised right!” Polyphemus wailed, shaking his olive tree club.
                        “Poor orphaned
                        brother! Help me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">No one moved. No sound but the ocean and my own heartbeat. Then Tyson stepped
                        forward, raising
                        his hands defensively. “Don’t fight, Cyclops brother. Put down the—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus spun toward his voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” I shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The tree struck him with such force it would’ve flattened me into a Percy pizza
                        with extra
                        olives. Tyson flew backward, plowing a trench in the sand. Polyphemus charged after him, but I
                        shouted, “No!”
                        and lunged as far as I could with Riptide. I’d hoped to sting Polyphemus in the back of the
                        thigh, but I managed
                        to leap a little bit higher. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Blaaaaah!” Polyphemus bleated just like his sheep, and swung at me with his
                        tree. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I dove, but still got raked across the back by a dozen jagged branches. I was
                        bleeding and
                        bruised and exhausted. The guinea pig inside me wanted to bolt. But I swallowed down my fear.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus swung the tree again, but this time I was ready. I grabbed a branch
                        as it passed,
                        ignoring the pain in my hands as I was jerked skyward, and let the Cyclops lift me into the air.
                        At the top of
                        the arc I let go and fell straight against the giant’s face—landing with both feet on his
                        already damaged eye.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Polyphemus yowled in pain. Tyson tackled him, pulling him down. I landed next
                        to them—sword in
                        hand, within striking distance of the monster’s heart. But I locked eyes with Tyson, and I knew
                        I couldn’t do
                        it. It just wasn’t right. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Let him go,” I told Tyson. “Run.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">With one last mighty effort, Tyson pushed the cursing older Cyclops away, and
                        we ran for the
                        surf. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I will smash you!” Polyphemus yelled, doubling over in pain. His enormous
                        hands cupped over
                        his eye. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson and I plunged into the waves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Where are you?” Polyphemus screamed. He picked up his tree club and threw it
                        into the water.
                        It splashed off to our right. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I summoned up a current to carry us, and we started gaining speed. I was
                        beginning to think we
                        might make it to the ship, when Clarisse shouted from the deck, “Yeah, Jackson! In your face,
                        Cyclops!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Shut up</i>, I wanted to yell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Rarrr!” Polyphemus picked up a boulder. He threw it toward the sound of
                        Clarisse’s voice, but
                        it fell short, narrowly missing Tyson and me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, yeah!” Clarisse taunted. “You throw like a wimp! Teach you to try
                        marrying me, you
                        idiot!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Clarisse!” I yelled, unable to stand it. “Shut up!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Too late. Polyphemus threw another boulder, and this time I watched helplessly
                        as it sailed
                        over my head and crashed through the hull of the <i class="calibre5">Queen Anne’s Revenge</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">You wouldn’t believe how fast a ship can sink. The <i class="calibre5">Queen
                            Anne’s Revenge

                    <p class="calibre13">I cursed, willing the sea to push us faster, but the ship’s masts were already
                        going under.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Dive!” I told Tyson. And as another rock sailed over our heads, we plunged
                        underwater. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">My friends were sinking fast, trying to swim, without luck, in the bubbly trail
                        of the ship’s
                        wreckage. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Not many people realize that when a ship goes down, it acts like a sinkhole,
                        pulling down
                        everything around it. Clarisse was a strong swimmer, but even she wasn’t making any progress.
                        Grover frantically
                        kicked with his hooves. Annabeth was hanging on to the Fleece, which flashed in the water like a
                        wave of new
                        pennies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I swam toward them, knowing that I might not have the strength to pull my
                        friends out. Worse,
                        pieces of timber were swirling around them; none of my power with water would help if I got
                        whacked on the head
                        by a beam. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">We need help</i>, I thought. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Yes. </i>Tyson’s voice, loud and clear in my head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked over at him, startled. I’d heard Nereids and other water spirits speak
                        to me
                        underwater before, but it never occurred to me... Tyson was a son of Poseidon. We could
                        communicate
                        with each
                        other. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Rainbow</i>, Tyson said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I nodded, then closed my eyes and concentrated, adding my voice to Tyson’s: <i
                            class="calibre5">RAINBOW! We need you! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Immediately, shapes shimmered in the darkness below—three horses with fish
                        tails, galloping
                        upward faster than dolphins. Rainbow and his friends glanced in our direction and seemed to read
                        our thoughts.
                        They whisked into the wreckage, and a moment later burst upward in a cloud of bubbles—Grover,
                        Annabeth, and
                        Clarisse each clinging to the neck of a hippocampus. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Rainbow, the largest, had Clarisse. He raced over to us and allowed Tyson to
                        grab hold of his
                        mane. His friend who bore Annabeth did the same for me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We broke the surface of the water and raced away from Polyphemus’s island.
                        Behind us, I could
                        hear the Cyclops roaring in triumph, “I did it! I finally sank Nobody!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hoped he never found out he was wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We skimmed across the sea as the island shrank to a dot and then disappeared.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Did it,” Annabeth muttered in exhaustion. “We...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She slumped against the neck of the hippocampus and instantly fell asleep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know how far the hippocampi could take us. I didn’t know where we were
                        going. I just
                        propped up Annabeth so she wouldn’t fall off, covered her in the Golden Fleece that we’d been
                        through so much to
                        get, and said a silent prayer of thanks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Which reminded me... I still owed the gods a debt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re a genius,” I told Annabeth quietly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I put my head against the Fleece, and before I knew it, I was asleep, too.

                    <p class="calibre13">Salt water splashed my face. Annabeth was shaking my shoulder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In the distance, the sun was setting behind a city skyline. I could see a
                        beachside highway
                        lined with palm trees, storefronts glowing with red and blue neon, a harbor filled with
                        sailboats and cruise
                        ships. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Miami, I think,” Annabeth said. “But the hippocampi are acting funny.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Sure enough, our fishy friends had slowed down and were whinnying and swimming
                        in circles,
                        sniffing the water. They didn’t look happy. One of them sneezed. I could tell what they were
                        thinking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This is as far as they’ll take us,” I said. “Too many humans. Too much
                        pollution. We’ll have
                        to swim to shore on our own.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">None of us was very psyched about that, but we thanked Rainbow and his friends
                        for the ride.
                        Tyson cried a little. He unfastened the makeshift saddle pack he’d made, which contained his
                        tool kit and a
                        couple of other things he’d salvaged from the <i class="calibre5">Birmingham </i>wreck. He
                        hugged Rainbow around
                        the neck, gave him a soggy mango he’d picked up on the island, and said good-bye. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Once the hippocampi’s white manes disappeared into the sea, we swam for shore.
                        The waves pushed
                        us forward, and in no time we were back in the mortal world. We wandered along the cruise line
                        docks, pushing
                        through crowds of people arriving for vacations. Porters bustled around with carts of luggage.
                        Taxi drivers
                        yelled at each other in Spanish and tried to cut in line for customers. If anybody noticed
                        us—five kids dripping
                        wet and looking like they’d just had a fight with a monster—they didn’t let on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Now that we were back among mortals, Tyson’s single eye had blurred from the
                        Mist. Grover had
                        put on his cap and sneakers. Even the Fleece had transformed from a sheepskin to a red-and-gold
                        high school
                        letter jacket with a large glittery Omega on the pocket. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth ran to the nearest newspaper box and checked the date on the <i
                            class="calibre5">Miami
                            Herald</i>. She cursed. “June eighteenth! We’ve been away from camp ten days!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s impossible!” Clarisse said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But I knew it wasn’t. Time traveled differently in monstrous places. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thalia’s tree must be almost dead,” Grover wailed. “We have to get the Fleece
                        back <i class="calibre5">tonight</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse slumped down on the pavement. “How are we supposed to do that?” Her
                        voice trembled.
                        “We’re hundreds of miles away. No money. No ride. This is just like the Oracle said. It’s <i
                            class="calibre5">your </i>fault, Jackson! If you hadn’t interfered—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy’s fault?!” Annabeth exploded. “Clarisse, how can you say that? You are
                        the biggest—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stop it!” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse put her head in hands. Annabeth stomped her foot in frustration. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The thing was: I’d almost forgotten this quest was supposed to be Clarisse’s.
                        For a scary
                        moment, I saw things from her point of view. How would I feel if a bunch of other heroes had
                        butted in and made
                        me look bad? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought about what I’d overheard in the boiler room of the CSS <i
                            class="calibre5">Birmingham</i>—Ares yelling at Clarisse, warning her that she’d better not
                        fail. Ares
                        couldn’t care less about the camp, but if Clarisse made him look bad... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Clarisse,” I said, “what did the Oracle tell you exactly?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked up. I thought she was going to tell me off, but instead she took a
                        deep breath and
                        recited her prophecy: </p>

                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <p class="center"><i class="calibre5">“You shall sail the iron ship with warriors of bone, <br
                                class="calibre1" />You shall find what you seek and make it your own, <br
                                class="calibre1" />But despair
                            for your life entombed within stone, <br class="calibre1" />And fail without friends, to fly
                            home
                            alone.”</i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />

                    <p class="calibre13">“Ouch,” Grover mumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” I said. “No... wait a minute. I’ve got it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I searched my pockets for money, and found nothing but a golden drachma. “Does
                        anybody have any
                        cash?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and Grover shook their heads morosely. Clarisse pulled a wet
                        Confederate dollar from
                        her pocket and sighed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cash?” Tyson asked hesitantly. “Like... green paper?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at him. “Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Like the kind in duffel bags?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, but we lost those bags days a-g-g—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stuttered to a halt as Tyson rummaged in his saddle pack and pulled out the
                        Ziploc bag full
                        of cash that Hermes had included in our supplies. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/17-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” I said. “How did you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thought it was a feed bag for Rainbow,” he said. “Found it floating in sea,
                        but only paper
                        inside. Sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He handed me the cash. Fives and tens, at least three hundred dollars. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I ran to the curb and grabbed a taxi that was just letting out a family of
                        cruise passengers.
                        “Clarisse,” I yelled. “Come on. You’re going to the airport. Annabeth, give her the Fleece.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I’m not sure which of them looked more stunned as I took the Fleece letter
                        jacket from
                        Annabeth, tucked the cash into its pocket, and put it in Clarisse’s arms. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Clarisse said, “You’d let me—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s your quest,” I said. “We only have enough money for one flight. Besides,
                        I can’t travel
                        by air. Zeus would blast me into a million pieces. That’s what the prophecy meant: you’d fail
                        without friends,
                        meaning you’d need our help, but you’d have to fly home alone. You have to get the Fleece back
                        safely.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I could see her mind working—suspicious at first, wondering what trick I was
                        playing, then
                        finally deciding I meant what I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She jumped in the cab. “You can count on me. I won’t fail.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not failing would be good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The cab peeled out in a cloud of exhaust. The Fleece was on its way. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” Annabeth said, “that was so—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Generous?” Grover offered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Insane</i>,” Annabeth corrected. “You’re betting the lives
                        of everybody at
                        camp that Clarisse will get the Fleece safely back by tonight?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s her quest,” I said. “She deserves a chance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy is nice,” Tyson said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy is <i class="calibre5">too </i>nice,” Annabeth grumbled, but I couldn’t
                        help thinking
                        that maybe, just maybe, she was a little impressed. I’d surprised her, anyway. And that wasn’t
                        easy to do. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come on,” I told my friends. “Let’s find another way home.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That’s when I turned and found a sword’s point at my throat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, cuz,” said Luke. “Welcome back to the States.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/17-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">His bear-man thugs appeared on either of side of us. One grabbed Annabeth and
                        Grover by their
                        T-shirt collars. The other tried to grab Tyson, but Tyson knocked him into a pile of luggage and
                        roared at Luke.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” Luke said calmly, “tell your giant to back down or I’ll have Oreius
                        bash your friends’
                        heads together.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Oreius grinned and raised Annabeth and Grover off the ground, kicking and
                        screaming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you want, Luke?” I growled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He smiled, the scar rippling on the side of his face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He gestured toward the end of the dock, and I noticed what should’ve been
                        obvious. The biggest
                        boat in port was the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why, Percy,” Luke said, “I want to extend my hospitality, of course.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The bear twins herded us aboard the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>.
                        They threw us
                        down on the aft deck in front of a swimming pool with sparkling fountains that sprayed into the
                        air. A dozen of
                        Luke’s assorted goons—snake people, Laistrygonians, demigods in battle armor—had gathered to
                        watch us get some
                        “hospitality.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And so, the Fleece,” Luke mused. “Where is it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked us over, prodding my shirt with the tip of his sword, poking Grover’s
                        jeans. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” Grover yelled. “That’s real goat fur under there!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry, old friend.” Luke smiled. “Just give me the Fleece and I’ll leave you
                        to return to
                        your, ah, little nature quest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Blaa-ha-ha!” Grover protested. “Some old friend!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Maybe you didn’t hear me.” Luke’s voice was dangerously calm.
                        “Where—is—the—Fleece?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not here,” I said. I probably shouldn’t have told him anything, but it felt
                        good to throw the
                        truth in his face. “We sent it on ahead of us. You messed up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke’s eyes narrowed. “You’re lying. You couldn’t have...” His face reddened as
                        a
                        horrible
                        possibility occurred to him. “Clarisse?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You trusted... you gave...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Agrius!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The bear giant flinched. “Y-yes?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get below and prepare my steed. Bring it to the deck. I need to fly to the
                        Miami Airport,
                        fast!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But, boss—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Do it!” Luke screamed. “Or I’ll feed you to the drakon!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The bear-man gulped and lumbered down the stairs. Luke paced in front of the
                        swimming pool,
                        cursing in Ancient Greek, gripping his sword so tight his knuckles turned white. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The rest of Luke’s crew looked uneasy. Maybe they’d never seen their boss so
                        unhinged before.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I started thinking... If I could use Luke’s anger, get him to talk so everybody
                        could hear how
                        crazy his plans were... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at the swimming pool, at the fountains spraying mist into the air,
                        making a rainbow in
                        the sunset. And suddenly I had an idea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’ve been toying with us all along,” I said. “You wanted us to bring you the
                        Fleece and save
                        you the trouble of getting it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke scowled. “Of course, you idiot! And you’ve messed everything up!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Traitor!” I dug my last gold drachma out of my pocket and threw it at Luke. As
                        I expected, he
                        dodged it easily. The coin sailed into the spray of rainbow-colored water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hoped my prayer would be accepted in silence. I thought with all my heart: <i
                            class="calibre5">O goddess, accept my offering. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You tricked all of us!” I yelled at Luke. “Even DIONYSUS at CAMP HALF-BLOOD!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Behind Luke, the fountain began to shimmer, but I needed everyone’s attention
                        on me, so I
                        uncapped Riptide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke just sneered. “This is no time for heroics, Percy. Drop your puny little
                        sword, or I’ll
                        have you killed sooner rather than later.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Who poisoned Thalia’s tree, Luke?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I did, of course,” he snarled. “I already told you that. I used elder python
                        venom, straight
                        from the depths of Tartarus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Chiron had nothing to do with it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ha! You know he would never do that. The old fool wouldn’t have the guts.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You call it guts? Betraying your friends? Endangering the whole camp?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke raised his sword. “You don’t understand the half of it. I was going to let
                        you take the
                        Fleece... once I was done with it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That made me hesitate. Why would he let me take the Fleece? He must’ve been
                        lying. But I
                        couldn’t afford to lose his attention. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You were going to heal Kronos,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes! The Fleece’s magic would’ve sped his mending process by tenfold. But you
                        haven’t stopped
                        us, Percy. You’ve only slowed us down a little.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And so you poisoned the tree, you betrayed Thalia, you set us up—all to help
                        Kronos destroy
                        the gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke gritted his teeth. “You know that! Why do you keep asking me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Because I want everybody in the audience to hear you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">What </i>audience?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then his eyes narrowed. He looked behind him and his goons did the same. They
                        gasped and
                        stumbled back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Above the pool, shimmering in the rainbow mist, was an Iris-message vision of
                        Dionysus,
                        Tantalus, and the whole camp in the dining pavilion. They sat in stunned silence, watching us.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/17-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well,” said Dionysus dryly, “some unplanned dinner entertainment.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mr. D, you heard him,” I said. “You all heard Luke. The poisoning of the tree
                        wasn’t Chiron’s
                        fault.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D sighed. “I suppose not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Iris-message could be a trick,” Tantalus suggested, but his attention was
                        mostly on his
                        cheeseburger, which he was trying to corner with both hands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I fear not,” Mr. D said, looking with distaste at Tantalus. “It appears I
                        shall have to
                        reinstate Chiron as activities director. I suppose I do miss the old horse’s pinochle games.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tantalus grabbed the cheeseburger. It didn’t bolt away from him. He lifted it
                        from the plate
                        and stared at it in amazement, as if it were the largest diamond in the world. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I got it!” he cackled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We are no longer in need of your services, Tantalus,” Mr. D announced. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tantalus looked stunned. “What? But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You may return to the Underworld. You are dismissed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No! But—Nooooooooooo!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As he dissolved into mist, his fingers clutched at the cheeseburger, trying to
                        bring it to his
                        mouth. But it was too late. He disappeared and the cheeseburger fell back onto its plate. The
                        campers exploded
                        into cheering. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke bellowed with rage. He slashed his sword through the fountain and the
                        Iris-message
                        dissolved, but the deed was done. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was feeling pretty good about myself, until Luke turned and gave me a
                        murderous look. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Kronos was right, Percy. You’re an unreliable weapon. You need to be
                        replaced.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wasn’t sure what he meant, but I didn’t have time to think about it. One of
                        his men blew a
                        brass whistle, and the deck doors flew open. A dozen more warriors poured out, making a circle
                        around us, the
                        brass tips of their spears bristling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke smiled at me. “You’ll never leave this boat alive.” </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">“One on one,” I challenged Luke. “What are you afraid of ?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke curled his lip. The soldiers who were about to kill us hesitated, waiting
                        for his order.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before he could saying anything, Agrius, the bear-man, burst onto the deck
                        leading a flying
                        horse. It was the first pure-black pegasus I’d ever seen, with wings like a giant raven. The
                        pegasus mare bucked
                        and whinnied. I could understand her thoughts. She was calling Agrius and Luke some names so bad
                        Chiron would’ve
                        washed her muzzle out with saddle soap. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/18-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sir!” Agrius called, dodging a pegasus hoof. “Your steed is ready!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke kept his eyes on me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I told you last summer, Percy,” he said. “You can’t bait me into a fight.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And you keep avoiding one,” I noticed. “Scared your warriors will see you get
                        whipped?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke glanced at his men, and he saw I’d trapped him. If he backed down now, he
                        would look weak.
                        If he fought me, he’d lose valuable time chasing after Clarisse. For my part, the best I could
                        hope for was to
                        distract him, giving my friends a chance to escape. If anybody could think of a plan to get them
                        out of there,
                        Annabeth could. On the downside, I knew how good Luke was at sword-fighting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll kill you quickly,” he decided, and raised his weapon. Backbiter was a
                        foot longer than my
                        own sword. Its blade glinted with an evil gray-and-gold light where the human steel had been
                        melded with
                        celestial bronze. I could almost feel the blade fighting against itself, like two opposing
                        magnets bound
                        together. I didn’t know how the blade had been made, but I sensed a tragedy. Someone had died in
                        the process.
                        Luke whistled to one of his men, who threw him a round leather-and-bronze shield. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He grinned at me wickedly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Luke,” Annabeth said, “at least give him a shield.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry, Annabeth,” he said. “You bring your own equipment to this party.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The shield was a problem. Fighting two-handed with just a sword gives you more
                        power, but
                        fighting one-handed with a shield gives you better defense and versatility. There are more
                        moves, more options,
                        more ways to kill. I thought back to Chiron, who’d told me to stay at camp no matter what, and
                        learn to fight.
                        Now I was going to pay for not listening to him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke lunged and almost killed me on the first try. His sword went under my arm,
                        slashing
                        through my shirt and grazing my ribs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I jumped back, then counterattacked with Riptide, but Luke slammed my blade
                        away with his
                        shield. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“My, Percy,” Luke chided. “You’re out of practice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He came at me again with a swipe to the head. I parried, returned with a
                        thrust. He sidestepped
                        easily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The cut on my ribs stung. My heart was racing. When Luke lunged again, I jumped
                        backward into
                        the swimming pool and felt a surge of strength. I spun underwater, creating a funnel cloud, and
                        blasted out of
                        the deep end, straight at Luke’s face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The force of the water knocked him down, spluttering and blinded. But before I
                        could strike, he
                        rolled aside and was on his feet again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I attacked and sliced off the edge of his shield, but that didn’t even faze
                        him. He dropped to
                        a crouch and jabbed at my legs. Suddenly my thigh was on fire, with a pain so intense I
                        collapsed. My jeans were
                        ripped above the knee. I was hurt. I didn’t know how badly. Luke hacked downward and I rolled
                        behind a deck
                        chair. I tried to stand, but my leg wouldn’t take the weight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Perrrrrcy!” Grover bleated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I rolled again as Luke’s sword slashed the deck chair in half, metal pipes and
                        all. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I clawed toward the swimming pool, trying hard not to black out. I’d never make
                        it. Luke knew
                        it, too. He advanced slowly, smiling. The edge of his sword was tinged with red. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“One thing I want you to watch before you die, Percy.” He looked at the
                        bear-man Oreius, who
                        was still holding Annabeth and Grover by the necks. “You can eat your dinner now, Oreius. Bon
                        appetit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He-he! He-he!” The bear-man lifted my friends and bared his teeth. That’s when
                        all Hades broke
                        loose. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Whish!</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A red-feathered arrow sprouted from Oreius’s mouth. With a surprised look on
                        his hairy face, he
                        crumpled to the deck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Brother!” Agrius wailed. He let the pegasus’s reins go slack just long enough
                        for the black
                        steed to kick him in the head and fly away free over Miami Bay. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">For a split second, Luke’s guards were too stunned to do anything except watch
                        the bear twins’
                        bodies dissolve into smoke. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then there was a wild chorus of war cries and hooves thundering against metal.
                        A dozen centaurs
                        charged out of the main stairwell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ponies!” Tyson cried with delight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mind had trouble processing everything I saw. Chiron was among the crowd,
                        but his relatives
                        were almost nothing like him. There were centaurs with black Arabian stallion bodies, others
                        with gold palomino
                        coats, others with orange-and-white spots like paint horses. Some wore brightly colored T-shirts
                        with Day-Glo
                        letters that said <small class="calibre4">PARTY PONIES: SOUTH FLORIDA CHAPTER</small>. Some were
                        armed with
                        bows, some with baseball bats, some with paintball guns. One had his face painted like a
                        Comanche warrior and
                        was waving a large orange Styrofoam hand making a big Number 1. Another was bare-chested and
                        painted entirely
                        green. A third had googly-eye glasses with the eyeballs bouncing around on Slinky coils, and one
                        of those
                        baseball caps with soda-can-and-straw attachments on either side. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They exploded onto the deck with such ferocity and color that for a moment even
                        Luke was
                        stunned. I couldn’t tell whether they had come to celebrate or attack. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/18-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Apparently both. As Luke was raising his sword to rally his troops, a centaur
                        shot a
                        custom-made arrow with a leather boxing glove on the end. It smacked Luke in the face and sent
                        him crashing into
                        the swimming pool. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His warriors scattered. I couldn’t blame them. Facing the hooves of a rearing
                        stallion is scary
                        enough, but when it’s a centaur, armed with a bow and whooping it up in a soda-drinking hat,
                        even the bravest
                        warrior would retreat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come get some!” yelled one of the party ponies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They let loose with their paintball guns. A wave of blue and yellow exploded
                        against Luke’s
                        warriors, blinding them and splattering them from head to toe. They tried to run, only to slip
                        and fall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron galloped toward Annabeth and Grover, neatly plucked them off the deck,
                        and deposited
                        them on his back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to get up, but my wounded leg still felt like it was on fire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke was crawling out of the pool. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Attack, you fools!” he ordered his troops. Somewhere down below deck, a large
                        alarm bell
                        thrummed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I knew any second we would be swamped by Luke’s reinforcements. Already, his
                        warriors were
                        getting over their surprise, coming at the centaurs with swords and spears drawn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson slapped half a dozen of them aside, knocking them over the guardrail into
                        Miami Bay. But
                        more warriors were coming up the stairs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Withdraw, brethren!” Chiron said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You won’t get away with this, horse man!” Luke shouted. He raised his sword,
                        but got smacked
                        in the face with another boxing glove arrow, and sat down hard in a deck chair. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                    <p class="calibre13">A palomino centaur hoisted me onto his back. “Dude, get your big friend!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” I yelled. “Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson dropped the two warriors he was about to tie into a knot and jogged after
                        us. He jumped
                        on the centaur’s back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dude!” the centaur groaned, almost buckling under Tyson’s weight. “Do the
                        words ‘low-carb
                        diet’ mean anything to you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke’s warriors were organizing themselves into a phalanx. But by the time they
                        were ready to
                        advance, the centaurs had galloped to the edge of the deck and fearlessly jumped the guardrail,
                        as if it were a
                        steeplechase and not ten stories above the ground. I was sure we were going to die. We plummeted
                        toward the
                        docks, but the centaurs hit the asphalt with hardly a jolt and galloped off, whooping and
                        yelling taunts at the
                        <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda </i>as we raced into the streets of downtown Miami.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I have no idea what the Miamians thought as we galloped by. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Streets and buildings began to blur as the centaurs picked up speed. It felt as
                        if space were
                        compacting—as if each centaur step took us miles and miles. In no time, we’d left the city
                        behind. We raced
                        through marshy fields of high grass and ponds and stunted trees. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally, we found ourselves in a trailer park at the edge of a lake. The
                        trailers were all
                        horse trailers, tricked out with televisions and mini-refrigerators and mosquito netting. We
                        were in a centaur
                        camp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dude!” said a party pony as he unloaded his gear. “Did you see that bear guy?
                        He was all like:
                        ‘Whoa, I have an arrow in my mouth!’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The centaur with the googly-eye glasses laughed. “That was awesome! Head slam!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The two centaurs charged at each other full-force and knocked heads, then went
                        staggering off
                        in different directions with crazy grins on their faces. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron sighed. He set Annabeth and Grover down on a picnic blanket next to me.
                        “I really wish
                        my cousins wouldn’t slam their heads together. They don’t have the brain cells to spare.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Chiron,” I said, still stunned by the fact that he was here. “You saved us.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He gave me a dry smile. “Well now, I couldn’t very well let you die, especially
                        since you’ve
                        cleared my name.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But how did you know where we were?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Advanced planning, my dear. I figured you would wash up near Miami if you made
                        it out of the
                        Sea of Monsters alive. Almost everything strange washes up near Miami.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Gee, thanks,” Grover mumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no,” Chiron said. “I didn’t mean... Oh, never mind. I <i
                            class="calibre5">am
                        </i>glad to see
                        you, my young satyr. The point is, I was able to eavesdrop on Percy’s Iris-message and trace the
                        signal. Iris
                        and I have been friends for centuries. I asked her to alert me to any important communications
                        in this area. It
                        then took no effort to convince my cousins to ride to your aid. As you see, centaurs can travel
                        quite fast when
                        we wish to. Distance for us is not the same as distance for humans.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked over at the campfire, where three party ponies were teaching Tyson to
                        operate a
                        paintball gun. I hoped they knew what they were getting into. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So what now?” I asked Chiron. “We just let Luke sail away? He’s got Kronos
                        aboard that ship.
                        Or parts of him, anyway.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron knelt, carefully folding his front legs underneath him. He opened the
                        medicine pouch on
                        his belt and started to treat my wounds. “I’m afraid, Percy, that today has been something of a
                        draw. We didn’t
                        have the strength of numbers to take that ship. Luke was not organized enough to pursue us.
                        Nobody won.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“But we got the Fleece!” Annabeth said. “Clarisse is on her way back to camp
                        with it right
                        now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron nodded, though he still looked uneasy. “You are all true heroes. And as
                        soon as we get
                        Percy fixed up, you must return to Half-Blood Hill. The centaurs shall carry you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re coming, too?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh yes, Percy. I’ll be relieved to get home. My brethren here simply do not
                        appreciate Dean
                        Martin’s music. Besides, I must have some words with Mr. D. There’s the rest of the summer to
                        plan. So much
                        training to do. And I want to see... I’m curious about the Fleece.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know exactly what he meant, but it made me worried about what Luke had
                        said: <i class="calibre5">I was going to let you take the Fleece... once I was done with it.
                        </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Had he just been lying? I’d learned with Kronos there was usually a plan within
                        a plan. The
                        titan lord wasn’t called the Crooked One for nothing. He had ways of getting people to do what
                        he wanted without
                        them ever realizing his true intentions. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Over by the campfire, Tyson let loose with his paintball gun. A blue projectile
                        splattered
                        against one of the centaurs, hurling him backward into the lake. The centaur came up grinning,
                        covered in swamp
                        muck and blue paint, and gave Tyson two thumbs up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth,” Chiron said, “perhaps you and Grover would go supervise Tyson and
                        my cousins before
                        they, ah, teach each other too many bad habits?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth met his eyes. Some kind of understanding passed between them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sure, Chiron,” Annabeth said. “Come on, goat boy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But I don’t like paintball.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, you do.” She hoisted Grover to his hooves and led him off toward the
                        campfire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron finished bandaging my leg. “Percy, I had a talk with Annabeth on the way
                        here. A talk
                        about the prophecy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Uh-oh, I thought. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It wasn’t her fault,” I said. “I made her tell me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His eyes flickered with irritation. I was sure he was going to chew me out, but
                        then his look
                        turned to weariness. “I suppose I could not expect to keep it secret forever.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So <i class="calibre5">am </i>I the one in the prophecy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron tucked his bandages back into his pouch. “I wish I knew, Percy. You’re
                        not yet sixteen.
                        For now we must simply train you as best we can, and leave the future to the Fates.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Fates. I hadn’t thought about those old ladies in a long time, but as soon
                        as Chiron
                        mentioned them, something clicked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s what it meant,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron frowned. “That’s what <i class="calibre5">what </i>meant?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Last summer. The omen from the Fates, when I saw them snip somebody’s life
                        string. I thought
                        it meant I was going to die right away, but it’s worse than that. It’s got something to do with
                        your prophecy.
                        The death they foretold—it’s going to happen when I’m sixteen.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron’s tail whisked nervously in the grass. “My boy, you can’t be sure of
                        that. We don’t even
                        know if the prophecy is about you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But there isn’t any other half-blood child of the Big Three!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That we know of.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And Kronos is rising. He’s going to destroy Mount Olympus!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He will try,” Chiron agreed. “And Western Civilization along with it, if we
                        don’t stop him.
                        But we <i class="calibre5">will </i>stop him. You will not be alone in that fight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I knew he was trying to make me feel better, but I remembered what Annabeth had
                        told me. It
                        would come down to one hero. One decision that would save or destroy the West. And I felt sure
                        the Fates had
                        been giving me some kind of warning about that. Something terrible was going to happen, either
                        to me or to
                        somebody I was close to. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m just a <i class="calibre5">kid</i>, Chiron,” I said miserably. “What good
                        is one lousy
                        hero against something like Kronos?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron managed a smile. “‘What good is one lousy hero’? Joshua Lawrence
                        Chamberlain said
                        something like that to me once, just before he single-handedly changed the course of your Civil
                        War.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He pulled an arrow from his quiver and turned the razor-sharp tip so it glinted
                        in the
                        firelight. “Celestial bronze, Percy. An immortal weapon. What would happen if you shot this at a
                        human?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nothing,” I said. “It would pass right through.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s right,” he said. “Humans don’t exist on the same level as the
                        immortals. They can’t
                        even be hurt by our weapons. But you, Percy—you are part god, part human. You live in both
                        worlds. You can be
                        harmed by both, and you can affect both. <i class="calibre5">That’s </i>what makes heroes so
                        special. You carry
                        the hopes of humanity into the realm of the eternal. Monsters never die. They are reborn from
                        the chaos and
                        barbarism that is always bubbling underneath civilization, the very stuff that makes Kronos
                        stronger. They must
                        be defeated again and again, kept at bay. Heroes embody that struggle. You fight the battles
                        humanity must win,
                        every generation, in order to stay human. Do you understand?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I... I don’t know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You must try, Percy. Because whether or not you are the child of the prophecy,
                        Kronos thinks
                        you might be. And after today, he will finally despair of turning you to his side. That <i
                            class="calibre5">is
                        </i>the only reason he hasn’t killed you yet, you know. As soon as he’s sure he can’t use you,
                        he will destroy
                        you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You talk like you know him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron pursed his lips. “I <i class="calibre5">do </i>know him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at him. I sometimes forgot just how old Chiron was. “Is that why Mr. D
                        blamed you when
                        the tree was poisoned? Why you said some people don’t trust you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Indeed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But, Chiron... I mean, come on! Why would they think you’d ever betray the
                        camp
                        for Kronos?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron’s eyes were deep brown, full of thousands of years of sadness. “Percy,
                        remember your
                        training. Remember your study of mythology. What is my connection to the titan lord?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to think, but I’d always gotten my mythology mixed up. Even now, when
                        it was so real,
                        so important to my own life, I had trouble keeping all the names and facts straight. I shook my
                        head. “You, uh,
                        owe Kronos a favor or something? He spared your life?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” Chiron said, his voice impossibly soft. “The titan Kronos is my
                        father.” </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">We arrived in Long Island just after Clarisse, thanks to the centaurs’ travel
                        powers. I rode on
                        Chiron’s back, but we didn’t talk much, especially not about Kronos. I knew it had been
                        difficult for Chiron to
                        tell me. I didn’t want to push him with more questions. I mean, I’ve met plenty of embarrassing
                        parents, but
                        Kronos, the evil titan lord who wanted to destroy Western Civilization? Not the kind of dad you
                        invited to
                        school for career day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When we got to camp, the centaurs were anxious to meet Dionysus. They’d heard
                        he threw some
                        really wild parties, but they were disappointed. The wine god was in no mood to celebrate as the
                        whole camp
                        gathered at the top of Half-Blood Hill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The camp had been through a hard two weeks. The arts and crafts cabin had
                        burned to the ground
                        from an attack by a <i class="calibre5">Draco Aionius </i>(which as near as I could figure was
                        Latin for
                        “really-big-lizard-with-breath-that-blows-stuff-up”). The Big House’s rooms were overflowing
                        with wounded. The
                        kids in the Apollo cabin, who were the best healers, had been working overtime performing first
                        aid. Everybody
                        looked weary and battered as we crowded around Thalia’s tree. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The moment Clarisse draped the Golden Fleece over the lowest bough, the
                        moonlight seemed to
                        brighten, turning from gray to liquid silver. A cool breeze rustled in the branches and rippled
                        through the
                        grass, all the way into the valley. Everything came into sharper focus—the glow of the fireflies
                        down in the
                        woods, the smell of the strawberry fields, the sound of the waves on the beach. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Gradually, the needles on the pine tree started turning from brown to green.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/19-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Everybody cheered. It was happening slowly, but there could be no doubt—the
                        Fleece’s magic was
                        seeping into the tree, filling it with new power and expelling the poison. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron ordered a twenty-four/seven guard duty on the hilltop, at least until he
                        could find an
                        appropriate monster to protect the Fleece. He said he’d place an ad in <i
                            class="calibre5">Olympus Weekly
                        </i>right away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In the meantime, Clarisse was carried on her cabin mates’ shoulders down to the
                        amphitheater,
                        where she was honored with a laurel wreath and a lot of celebrating around the campfire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nobody gave Annabeth or me a second look. It was as if we’d never left. In a
                        way, I guess that
                        was the best thank-you anyone could give us, because if they admitted we’d snuck out of camp to
                        do the quest,
                        they’d have to expel us. And really, I didn’t want any more attention. It felt good to be just
                        one of the
                        campers for once. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Later that night, as we were roasting s’mores and listening to the Stoll
                        brothers tell us a
                        ghost story about an evil king who was eaten alive by demonic breakfast pastries, Clarisse
                        shoved me from behind
                        and whispered in my ear, “Just because you were cool one time, Jackson, don’t think you’re off
                        the hook with
                        Ares. I’m still waiting for the right opportunity to pulverize you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I gave her a grudging smile. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” she demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nothing,” I said. “Just good to be home.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The next morning, after the party ponies headed back to Florida, Chiron made a
                        surprise
                        announcement: the chariot races would go ahead as scheduled. We’d all figured they were history
                        now that
                        Tantalus was gone, but completing them did feel like the right thing to do, especially now that
                        Chiron was back
                        and the camp was safe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson wasn’t too keen on the idea of getting back in a chariot after our first
                        experience, but
                        he was happy to let me team up with Annabeth. I would drive, Annabeth would defend, and Tyson
                        would act as our
                        pit crew. While I worked with the horses, Tyson fixed up Athena’s chariot and added a whole
                        bunch of special
                        modifications. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We spent the next two days training like crazy. Annabeth and I agreed that if
                        we won, the prize
                        of no chores for the rest of the month would be split between our two cabins. Since Athena had
                        more campers,
                        they would get most of the time off, which was fine by me. I didn’t care about the prize. I just
                        wanted to win.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The night before the race, I stayed late at the stables. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was talking to our horses, giving them one final brushing, when somebody
                        right behind me
                        said, “Fine animals, horses. Wish I’d thought of them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A middle-aged guy in a postal carrier outfit was leaning against the stable
                        door. He was slim,
                        with curly black hair under his white pith helmet, and he had a mailbag slung over his shoulder.

                    <p class="calibre13">“Hermes?” I stammered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hello, Percy. Didn’t recognize me without my jogging clothes?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uh...” I wasn’t sure whether I was supposed to kneel or buy stamps from him or
                        what. Then it
                        occurred to me why he must be here. “Oh, listen, Lord Hermes, about Luke...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The god arched his eyebrows. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uh, we saw him, all right,” I said, “but—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You weren’t able to talk sense into him?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, we kind of tried to kill each other in a duel to the death.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I see. You tried the diplomatic approach.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m really sorry. I mean, you gave us those awesome gifts and everything. And
                        I know you
                        wanted Luke to come back. But... he’s turned bad. <i class="calibre5">Really </i>bad. He said he
                        feels like you
                        abandoned him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I waited for Hermes to get angry. I figured he’d turn me into a hamster or
                        something, and I did
                        <i class="calibre5">not </i>want to spend any more time as a rodent.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Instead, he just sighed. “Do you ever feel your father abandoned <i
                            class="calibre5">you</i>,
                        Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Oh, man. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to say, “Only a few hundred times a day.” I hadn’t spoken to Poseidon
                        since last
                        summer. I’d never even been to his underwater palace. And then there was the whole thing with
                        Tyson—no warning,
                        no explanation. Just <i class="calibre5">boom</i>, you have a brother. You’d think that deserved
                        a little
                        heads-up phone call or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. I realized I <i
                            class="calibre5">did </i>want
                        recognition for the quest I’d completed, but not from the other campers. I wanted my dad to say
                        something. To
                        notice me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Hermes readjusted the mailbag on his shoulder. “Percy, the hardest part about
                        being a god is
                        that you must often act indirectly, especially when it comes to your own children. If we were to
                        intervene every
                        time our children had a problem... well, that would only create more problems and more
                        resentment.
                        But I believe if
                        you give it some thought, you will see that Poseidon <i class="calibre5">has </i>been paying
                        attention to you.
                        He has answered your prayers. I can only hope that some day, Luke may realize the same about me.
                        Whether you
                        feel like you succeeded or not, you reminded Luke who he was. You spoke to him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I tried to kill him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Hermes shrugged. “Families are messy. Immortal families are eternally messy.
                        Sometimes the best
                        we can do is to remind each other that we’re related, for better or worse... and try to keep the
                        maiming and
                        killing to a minimum.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It didn’t sound like much of a recipe for the perfect family. Then again, as I
                        thought about my
                        quest, I realized maybe Hermes was right. Poseidon had sent the hippocampi to help us. He’d
                        given me powers over
                        the sea that I’d never known about before. And there was Tyson. Had Poseidon brought us together
                        on purpose? How
                        many times had Tyson saved my life this summer? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In the distance, the conch horn sounded, signaling curfew. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You should get to bed,” Hermes said. “I’ve helped you get into quite enough
                        trouble this
                        summer already. I really only came to make this delivery.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A delivery?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I <i class="calibre5">am </i>the messenger of the gods, Percy.” He took an
                        electronic
                        signature pad from his mailbag and handed it to me. “Sign there, please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I picked up the stylus before realizing it was entwined with a pair of tiny
                        green snakes. “Ah!”
                        I dropped the pad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Ouch</i>, said George. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Really, Percy</i>, Martha scolded. <i
                            class="calibre5">Would </i>you <i class="calibre5">want to be dropped on the floor of a
                            horse stable? </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, uh, sorry.” I didn’t much like touching snakes, but I picked up the pad
                        and the stylus
                        again. Martha and George wriggled under my fingers, forming a kind of pencil grip like the ones
                        my special ed
                        teacher made me use in second grade. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Did you bring me a rat? </i>George asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No...” I said. “Uh, we didn’t find any.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">What about a guinea pig? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">George! </i>Martha chided. <i class="calibre5">Don’t tease
                            the boy. </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I signed my name and gave the pad back to Hermes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In exchange, he handed me a sea-blue envelope. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My fingers trembled. Even before I opened it, I could tell it was from my
                        father. I could sense
                        his power in the cool blue paper, as if the envelope itself had been folded out of an ocean
                        wave. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Good luck tomorrow,” Hermes said. “Fine team of horses you have there, though
                        you’ll excuse me
                        if I root for the Hermes cabin.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">And don’t be too discouraged when you read it, dear</i>,
                        Martha told me. <i class="calibre5">He </i>does <i class="calibre5">have your interests at

                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Don’t mind her</i>, George said. <i class="calibre5">And
                            next time,
                            remember, snakes work for tips. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Enough, you two,” Hermes said. “Good-bye, Percy. For now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Small white wings sprouted from his pith helmet. He began to glow, and I knew
                        enough about the
                        gods to avert my eyes before he revealed his true divine form. With a brilliant white flash he
                        was gone, and I
                        was alone with the horses. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the blue envelope in my hands. It was addressed in strong but
                        elegant handwriting
                        that I’d seen once before, on a package Poseidon had sent me last summer. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">An actual letter from my father. Maybe he would tell me I’d done a good job
                        getting the Fleece.
                        He’d explain about Tyson, or apologize for not talking to me sooner. There were so many things
                        that I wanted
                        that letter to say. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">Two simple words were printed in the middle of the page: </p>

                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="center2"><i class="calibre5"><b class="calibre15">Brace Yourself</b></i></p>

                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The next morning, everybody was buzzing about the chariot race, though they
                        kept glancing
                        nervously toward the sky like they expected to see Stymphalian birds gathering. None did. It was
                        a beautiful
                        summer day with blue sky and plenty of sunshine. The camp had started to look the way it should
                        look: the
                        meadows were green and lush; the white columns gleamed on the Greek buildings; dryads played
                        happily in the
                        woods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And I was miserable. I’d been lying awake all night, thinking about Poseidon’s
                        warning. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Brace yourself.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I mean, he goes to the trouble of writing a letter, and he writes two words?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Martha the snake had told me not to feel disappointed. Maybe Poseidon had a
                        reason for being so
                        vague. Maybe he didn’t know exactly what he was warning me about, but he sensed something big
                        was about to
                        happen—something that could completely knock me off my feet unless I was prepared. It was hard,
                        but I tried to
                        turn my thoughts to the race. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As Annabeth and I drove onto the track, I couldn’t help admiring the work Tyson
                        had done on the
                        Athena chariot. The carriage gleamed with bronze reinforcements. The wheels were realigned with
                        magical
                        suspension so we glided along with hardly a bump. The rigging for the horses was so perfectly
                        balanced that the
                        team turned at the slightest tug of the reins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson had also made us two javelins, each with three buttons on the shaft. The
                        first button
                        primed the javelin to explode on impact, releasing razor wire that would tangle and shred an
                        opponent’s wheels.
                        The second button produced a blunt (but still very painful) bronze spearhead designed to knock a
                        driver out of
                        his carriage. The third button brought up a grappling hook that could be used to lock onto an
                        enemy’s chariot or
                        push it away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I figured we were in pretty good shape for the race, but Tyson still warned me
                        to be careful.
                        The other chariot teams had plenty of tricks up their togas. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Here,” he said, just before the race began. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He handed me a wristwatch. There wasn’t anything special about it—just a
                        white-and-silver clock
                        face, a black leather strap—but as soon as I saw it I realized that this is what I’d seen him
                        tinkering on all
                        summer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t usually like to wear watches. Who cared what time it was? But I
                        couldn’t say no to
                        Tyson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thanks, man.” I put it on and found it was surprisingly light and comfortable.
                        I could hardly
                        tell I was wearing it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Didn’t finish in time for the trip,” Tyson mumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry, sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, man. No big deal.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“If you need protection in race,” he advised, “hit the button.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah, okay.” I didn’t see how keeping time was going to help a whole lot, but I
                        was touched that
                        Tyson was concerned. I promised him I’d remember the watch. “And, hey, um, Tyson...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I wanted to say, well...” I tried to figure out how to apologize for getting
                        embarrassed about
                        him before the quest, for telling everyone he wasn’t my real brother. It wasn’t easy to find the
                        words. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know what you will tell me,” Tyson said, looking ashamed. “Poseidon did care
                        for me after
                        all.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uh, well—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He sent you to help me. Just what I asked for.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I blinked. “You asked Poseidon for... me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“For a friend,” Tyson said, twisting his shirt in his hands. “Young Cyclopes
                        grow up alone on
                        the streets, learn to make things out of scraps. Learn to survive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But that’s so cruel!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He shook his head earnestly. “Makes us appreciate blessings, not be greedy and
                        mean and fat
                        like Polyphemus. But I got scared. Monsters chased me so much, clawed me sometimes—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The scars on your back?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A tear welled in his eye. “Sphinx on Seventy-second Street. Big bully. I prayed
                        to Daddy for
                        help. Soon the people at Meriwether found me. Met you. Biggest blessing ever. Sorry I said
                        Poseidon was mean. He sent me a brother.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at the watch that Tyson had made me. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/19-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Annabeth called. “Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron was at the starting line, ready to blow the conch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson...” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Go,” Tyson said. “You will win!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I—yeah, okay, big guy. We’ll win this one for you.” I climbed on board the
                        chariot and got
                        into position just as Chiron blew the starting signal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The horses knew what to do. We shot down the track so fast I would’ve fallen
                        out if my arms
                        hadn’t been wrapped in the leather reins. Annabeth held on tight to the rail. The wheels glided
                        beautifully. We
                        took the first turn a full chariot-length ahead of Clarisse, who was busy trying to fight off a
                        javelin attack
                        from the Stoll brothers in the Hermes chariot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ve got ’em!” I yelled, but I spoke too soon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Incoming!” Annabeth yelled. She threw her first javelin in grappling hook
                        mode, knocking away
                        a lead-weighted net that would have entangled us both. Apollo’s chariot had come up on our
                        flank. Before
                        Annabeth could rearm herself, the Apollo warrior threw a javelin into our right wheel. The
                        javelin shattered,
                        but not before snapping some of our spokes. Our chariot lurched and wobbled. I was sure the
                        wheel would collapse
                        altogether, but we somehow kept going. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I urged the horses to keep up the speed. We were now neck and neck with Apollo.
                        Hephaestus was
                        coming up close behind. Ares and Hermes were falling behind, riding side by side as Clarisse
                        went
                        sword-on-javelin with Connor Stoll. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">If we took one more hit to our wheel, I knew we would capsize. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re mine!” the driver from Apollo yelled. He was a first-year camper. I
                        didn’t remember his
                        name, but he sure was confident. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, right!” Annabeth yelled back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She picked up her second javelin—a real risk considering we still had one full
                        lap to go—and
                        threw it at the Apollo driver. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her aim was perfect. The javelin grew a heavy spear point just as it caught the
                        driver in the
                        chest, knocking him against his teammate and sending them both toppling out of their chariot in
                        a backward
                        somersault. The horses felt the reins go slack and went crazy, riding straight for the crowd.
                        Campers scrambled
                        for cover as the horses leaped the corner of the bleachers and the golden chariot flipped over.
                        The horses
                        galloped back toward their stable, dragging the upside-down chariot behind them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I held our own chariot together through the second turn, despite the groaning
                        of the right
                        wheel. We passed the starting line and thundered into our final lap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The axle creaked and moaned. The wobbling wheel was making us lose speed, even
                        though the
                        horses were responding to my every command, running like a well-oiled machine. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Hephaestus team was still gaining. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Beckendorf grinned as he pressed a button on his command console. Steel cables
                        shot out of the
                        front of his mechanical horses, wrapping around our back rail. Our chariot shuddered as
                        Beckendorf’s winch
                        system started working—pulling us backward while Beckendorf pulled himself forward. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth cursed and drew her knife. She hacked at the cables but they were too
                        thick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Can’t cut them!” she yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Hephaestus chariot was now dangerously close, their horses about to trample
                        us underfoot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Switch with me!” I told Annabeth. “Take the reins!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Trust me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pulled herself to the front and grabbed the reins. I turned, trying hard to
                        keep my
                        footing, and uncapped Riptide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I slashed down and the cables snapped like kite string. We lurched forward, but
                        Beckendorf’s
                        driver just swung his chariot to our left and pulled up next to us. Beckendorf drew his sword.
                        He slashed at
                        Annabeth, and I parried the blade away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were coming up on the last turn. We’d never make it. I needed to disable the
                        Hephaestus
                        chariot and get it out of the way, but I had to protect Annabeth, too. Just because Beckendorf
                        was a nice guy
                        didn’t mean he wouldn’t send us both to the infirmary if we let our guard down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were neck and neck now, Clarisse coming up from behind, making up for lost
                        time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“See ya, Percy!” Beckendorf yelled. “Here’s a little parting gift!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He threw a leather pouch into our chariot. It stuck to the floor immediately
                        and began
                        billowing green smoke. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Greek fire!” Annabeth yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I cursed. I’d heard stories about what Greek fire could do. I figured we had
                        maybe ten seconds
                        before it exploded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get rid of it!” Annabeth shouted, but I couldn’t. Hephaestus’s chariot was
                        still alongside,
                        waiting until the last second to make sure their little present blew up. Beckendorf was keeping
                        me busy with his
                        sword. If I let my guard down long enough to deal with the Greek fire, Annabeth would get sliced
                        and we’d crash
                        anyway. I tried to kick the leather pouch away with my foot, but I couldn’t. It was stuck fast.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I remembered the watch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know how it could help, but I managed to punch the stopwatch button.
                        Instantly, the
                        watch changed. It expanded, the metal rim spiraling outward like an old-fashioned camera
                        shutter, a leather
                        strap wrapping around my forearm until I was holding a round war shield four feet wide, the
                        inside soft leather,
                        the outside polished bronze engraved with designs I didn’t have time to examine. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/19-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">All I knew: Tyson had come through. I raised the shield, and Beckendorf’s sword
                        clanged against
                        it. His blade shattered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” he shouted. “How—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He didn’t have time to say more because I knocked him in the chest with my new
                        shield and sent
                        him flying out of his chariot, tumbling in the dirt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was about use Riptide to slash at the driver when Annabeth yelled, “Percy!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Greek fire was shooting sparks. I shoved the tip of my sword under the
                        leather pouch and
                        flipped it up like a spatula. The firebomb dislodged and flew into the Hephaestus chariot at the
                        driver’s feet.
                        He yelped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In a split second the driver made the right choice: he dove out of the chariot,
                        which careened
                        away and exploded in green flames. The metal horses seemed to short-circuit. They turned and
                        dragged the burning
                        wreckage back toward Clarisse and the Stoll brothers, who had to swerve to avoid it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth pulled the reins for the last turn. I held on, sure we would capsize,
                        but somehow she
                        brought us through and spurred the horses across the finish line. The crowd roared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Once the chariot stopped, our friends mobbed us. They started chanting our
                        names, but Annabeth
                        yelled over the noise: “Hold up! Listen! It wasn’t just us!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The crowd didn’t want to be quiet, but Annabeth made herself heard: “We
                        couldn’t have done it
                        without somebody else! We couldn’t have won this race or gotten the Fleece or saved Grover or
                        anything! We owe
                        our lives to Tyson, Percy’s...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Brother!” I said, loud enough for everybody to hear. “Tyson, my baby brother.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson blushed. The crowd cheered. Annabeth planted a kiss on my cheek. The
                        roaring got a lot
                        louder after that. The entire Athena cabin lifted me and Annabeth and Tyson onto their shoulders
                        and carried us
                        toward the winner’s platform, where Chiron was waiting to bestow the laurel wreaths. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">That afternoon was one of the happiest I’d ever spent at camp, which maybe goes
                        to show, you
                        never know when your world is about to be rocked to pieces. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover announced that he’d be able to spend the rest of the summer with us
                        before resuming his
                        quest for Pan. His bosses at the Council of Cloven Elders were so impressed that he hadn’t
                        gotten himself killed
                        and had cleared the way for future searchers, that they granted him a two-month furlough and a
                        new set of reed
                        pipes. The only bad news: Grover insisted on playing those pipes all afternoon long, and his
                        musical skills
                        hadn’t improved much. He played “YMCA,” and the strawberry plants started going crazy, wrapping
                        around our feet
                        like they were trying to strangle us. I guess I couldn’t blame them. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/20-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover told me he could dissolve the empathy link between us, now that we were
                        face to face,
                        but I told him I’d just as soon keep it if that was okay with him. He put down his reeds pipes
                        and stared at me.
                        “But, if I get in trouble again, you’ll be in danger, Percy! You could die!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“If you get in trouble again, I want to know about it. And I’ll come help you
                        again, G-man. I
                        wouldn’t have it any other way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the end he agreed not to break the link. He went back to playing “YMCA” for
                        the strawberry
                        plants. I didn’t need an empathy link with the plants to know how they felt about it. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Later on during archery class, Chiron pulled me aside and told me he’d fixed my
                        problems with
                        Meriwether Prep. The school no longer blamed me for destroying their gymnasium. The police were
                        no longer
                        looking for me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How did you manage that?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron’s eyes twinkled. “I merely suggested that the mortals had seen something
                        different on
                        that day—a furnace explosion that was not your fault.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You just said that and they bought it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I manipulated the Mist. Some day, when you’re ready, I’ll show how it’s done.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You mean, I can go back to Meriwether next year?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron raised his eyebrows. “Oh, no, they’ve still expelled you. Your
                        headmaster, Mr. Bonsai,
                        said you had—how did he put it?—un-groovy karma that disrupted the school’s educational aura.
                        But you’re not in
                        any legal trouble, which was a relief to your mother. Oh, and speaking of your mother...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He unclipped his cell phone from his quiver and handed it to me. “It’s high
                        time you called
                        her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The worst part was the beginning—the
                        “Percy-Jacksonwhat-were-you-thinking-do-you-have-any-idea-howworried-I-was-sneaking-off-to-camp-without-permissiongoing-on-dangerous-quests-and-scaring-me-half-to-death”
                        part. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But finally she paused to catch her breath. “Oh, I’m just glad you’re safe!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That’s the great thing about my mom. She’s no good at staying angry. She tries,
                        but it just
                        isn’t in her nature. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m sorry, Mom,” I told her. “I won’t scare you again.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t promise me that, Percy. You know very well it will only get worse.” She
                        tried to sound
                        casual about it, but I could tell she was pretty shaken up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to say something to make her feel better, but I knew she was right.
                        Being a
                        half-blood, I would always be doing things that scared her. And as I got older, the dangers
                        would just get
                        greater. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I could come home for a while,” I offered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no. Stay at camp. Train. Do what you need to do. But you <i

                        home for the next school year?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, of course. Uh, if there’s any school that will take me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, we’ll find something, dear,” my mother sighed. “Some place where they
                        don’t know us yet.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">As for Tyson, the campers treated him like a hero. I would’ve been happy to
                        have him as my
                        cabin mate forever, but that evening, as we were sitting on a sand dune overlooking the Long
                        Island Sound, he
                        made an announcement that completely took me by surprise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dream came from Daddy last night,” he said. “He wants me to visit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wondered if he was kidding, but Tyson really didn’t know how to kid.
                        “Poseidon sent you a
                        dream message?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson nodded. “Wants me to go underwater for the rest of the summer. Learn to
                        work at Cyclopes’
                        forges. He called it an inter—an intern—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“An internship?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I let that sink in. I’ll admit, I felt a little jealous. Poseidon had never
                        invited <i class="calibre5">me </i>underwater. But then I thought, Tyson was <i
                            class="calibre5">going</i>? Just like
                        that? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“When would you leave?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now. Like... <i class="calibre5">now </i>now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared out at the waves in the Long Island Sound. The water was glistening
                        red in the sunset.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m happy for you, big guy,” I managed. “Seriously.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hard to leave my new brother,” he said with a tremble in his voice. “But I
                        want to make
                        things. Weapons for the camp. You will need them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Unfortunately, I knew he was right. The Fleece hadn’t solved all the camp’s
                        problems. Luke was
                        still out there, gathering an army aboard the <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>. Kronos
                        was still
                        re-forming in his golden coffin. Eventually, we would have to fight them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’ll make the best weapons ever,” I told Tyson. I held up my watch proudly.
                        “I bet they’ll
                        tell good time, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson sniffled. “Brothers help each other.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re my brother,” I said. “No doubt about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He patted me on the back so hard he almost knocked me down the sand dune. Then
                        he wiped a tear
                        from his cheek and stood to go. “Use the shield well.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I will, big guy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Save your life some day.” The way he said it, so matter-of-fact, I wondered if
                        that Cyclops
                        eye of his could see into the future. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He headed down to the beach and whistled. Rainbow, the hippocampus, burst out
                        of the waves. I
                        watched the two of them ride off together into the realm of Poseidon. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/20-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Once they were gone, I looked down at my new wristwatch. I pressed the button
                        and the shield
                        spiraled out to full size. Hammered into the bronze were pictures in Ancient Greek style, scenes
                        from our
                        adventures this summer. There was Annabeth slaying a Laistrygonian dodgeball player, me fighting
                        the bronze
                        bulls on Half-Blood Hill, Tyson riding Rainbow toward the <i class="calibre5">Princess
                            Andromeda</i>, the CSS <i class="calibre5">Birmingham </i>blasting its cannons at Charybdis.
                        I ran my hand across a picture of Tyson,
                        battling the Hydra as he held aloft a box of Monster Donuts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t help feeling sad. I knew Tyson would have an awesome time under the
                        ocean. But I’d
                        miss everything about him—his fascination with horses, the way he could fix chariots or crumple
                        metal with his
                        bare hands, or tie bad guys into knots. I’d even miss him snoring like an earthquake in the next
                        bunk all night.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and Grover were standing at the top of the sand dune. I guess maybe I
                        had some sand in
                        my eyes, because I was blinking a lot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson...” I told them. “He had to...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We know,” Annabeth said softly. “Chiron told us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cyclopes forges.” Grover shuddered. “I hear the cafeteria food there is
                        terrible! Like, no
                        enchiladas <i class="calibre5">at all</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth held out her hand. “Come on, Seaweed Brain. Time for dinner.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We walked back toward the dining pavilion together, just the three of us, like
                        old times. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">A storm raged that night, but it parted around Camp Half-Blood as storms
                        usually did. Lightning
                        flashed against the horizon, waves pounded the shore, but not a drop fell in our valley. We were
                        protected
                        again, thanks to the Fleece, sealed inside our magical borders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Still, my dreams were restless. I heard Kronos taunting me from the depths of
                        Tartarus: <i class="calibre5">Polyphemus sits blindly in his cave, young hero, believing he has
                            won a great victory. Are
                            you any less deluded? </i>The titan’s cold laughter filled the darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then my dream changed. I was following Tyson to the bottom of the sea, into the
                        court of
                        Poseidon. It was a radiant hall filled with blue light, the floor cobbled with pearls. And
                        there, on a throne of
                        coral, sat my father, dressed like a simple fisherman in khaki shorts and a sun-bleached
                        T-shirt. I looked up
                        into his tan weathered face, his deep green eyes, and he spoke two words: <i
                            class="calibre5">Brace yourself.
                        </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I woke with a start. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a banging on the door. Grover flew inside without waiting for
                        permission. “Percy!” he
                        stammered. “Annabeth... on the hill... she...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The look in his eyes told me something was terribly wrong. Annabeth had been on
                        guard duty that
                        night, protecting the Fleece. If something had happened—</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I ripped off the covers, my blood like ice water in my veins. I threw on some
                        clothes while
                        Grover tried to make a complete sentence, but he was too stunned, too out of breath. “She’s
                        lying there... just
                        lying there...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I ran outside and raced across the central yard, Grover right behind me. Dawn
                        was just
                        breaking, but the whole camp seemed to be stirring. Word was spreading. Something huge had
                        happened. A few
                        campers were already making their way toward the hill, satyrs and nymphs and heroes in a weird
                        mix of armor and
                        pajamas. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I heard the clop of horse hooves, and Chiron galloped up behind us, looking
                        grim. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Is it true?” he asked Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover could only nod, his expression dazed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to ask what was going on, but Chiron grabbed me by the arm and
                        effortlessly lifted me
                        onto his back. Together we thundered up Half-Blood Hill, where a small crowd had started to
                        gather. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-2-scenes/20-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I expected to see the Fleece missing from the pine tree, but it was still
                        there, glittering in
                        the first light of dawn. The storm had broken and the sky was bloodred. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Curse the titan lord,” Chiron said. “He’s tricked us again, given himself
                        another chance to
                        control the prophecy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Fleece,” he said. “The Fleece did its work too well.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We galloped forward, everyone moving out of our way. There at the base of the
                        tree, a girl was
                        lying unconscious. Another girl in Greek armor was kneeling next to her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Blood roared in my ears. I couldn’t think straight. Annabeth had been attacked?
                        But why was the
                        Fleece still there? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The tree itself looked perfectly fine, whole and healthy, suffused with the
                        essence of the
                        Golden Fleece. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It healed the tree,” Chiron said, his voice ragged. “And poison was not the
                        only thing it
                        purged.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I realized Annabeth wasn’t the one lying on the ground. She was the one in
                        armor, kneeling
                        next to the unconscious girl. When Annabeth saw us, she ran to Chiron. “It... she... just
                        suddenly
                        there...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her eyes were streaming with tears, but I still didn’t understand. I was too
                        freaked out to
                        make sense of it all. I leaped off Chiron’s back and ran toward the unconscious girl. Chiron
                        said: “Percy,
                        wait!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I knelt by her side. She had short black hair and freckles across her nose. She
                        was built like
                        a long-distance runner, lithe and strong, and she wore clothes that were somewhere between punk
                        and Goth—a black
                        T-shirt, black tattered jeans, and a leather jacket with buttons from a bunch of bands I’d never
                        heard of. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She wasn’t a camper. I didn’t recognize her from any of the cabins. And yet I
                        had the strangest
                        feeling I’d seen her before.... </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s true,” Grover said, panting from his run up the hill. “I can’t
                        believe...”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nobody else came close to the girl. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I put my hand on her forehead. Her skin was cold, but my fingertips tingled as
                        if they were
                        burning. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“She needs nectar and ambrosia,” I said. She was clearly a half-blood, whether
                        she was a camper
                        or not. I could sense that just from one touch. I didn’t understand why everyone was acting so
                        scared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I took her by the shoulders and lifted her into sitting position, resting her
                        head on my
                        shoulder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come on!” I yelled to the others. “What’s wrong with you people? Let’s get her
                        to the Big
                        House.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">No one moved, not even Chiron. They were all too stunned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then the girl took a shaky breath. She coughed and opened her eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her irises were startlingly blue—electric blue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The girl stared at me in bewilderment, shivering and wild-eyed. “Who—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m Percy,” I said. “You’re safe now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Strangest dream...” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s okay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dying.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” I assured her. “You’re okay. What’s your name?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That’s when I knew. Even before she said it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The girl’s blue eyes stared into mine, and I understood what the Golden Fleece
                        quest had been
                        about. The poisoning of the tree. Everything. Kronos had done it to bring another chess piece
