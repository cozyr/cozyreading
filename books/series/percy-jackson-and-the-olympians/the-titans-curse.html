                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The Friday before winter break, my mom packed me an overnight bag and a few
                        deadly weapons and
                        took me to a new boarding school. We picked up my friends Annabeth and Thalia on the way. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was an eight-hour drive from New York to Bar Harbor, Maine. Sleet and snow
                        pounded the
                        highway. Annabeth, Thalia, and I hadn’t seen each other in months, but between the blizzard and
                        the thought of
                        what we were about to do, we were too nervous to talk much. Except for my mom. She talks <i
                            class="calibre5">more </i>when she’s nervous. By the time we finally got to Westover Hall,
                        it was getting
                        dark, and she’d told Annabeth and Thalia every embarrassing baby story there was to tell about
                        me. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia wiped the fog off the car window and peered outside. “Oh, yeah. This’ll
                        be fun.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Westover Hall looked like an evil knight’s castle. It was all black stone, with
                        towers and slit
                        windows and a big set of wooden double doors. It stood on a snowy cliff overlooking this big
                        frosty forest on
                        one side and the gray churning ocean on the other. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Are you sure you don’t want me to wait?” my mother asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, thanks, Mom,” I said. “I don’t know how long it will take. We’ll be okay.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But how will you get back? I’m worried, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hoped I wasn’t blushing. It was bad enough I had to depend on my mom to drive
                        me to my
                        battles. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s okay, Ms. Jackson.” Annabeth smiled reassuringly. Her blond hair was
                        tucked into a ski
                        cap and her gray eyes were the same color as the ocean. “We’ll keep him out of trouble.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mom seemed to relax a little. She thinks Annabeth is the most levelheaded
                        demigod ever to
                        hit eighth grade. She’s sure Annabeth often keeps me from getting killed. She’s right, but that
                        doesn’t mean I
                        have to like it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right, dears,” my mom said. “Do you have everything you need?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, Ms. Jackson,” Thalia said. “Thanks for the ride.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Extra sweaters? You have my cell phone number?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mom—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Your ambrosia and nectar, Percy? And a golden drachma in case you need to
                        contact camp?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mom, seriously! We’ll be fine. Come on, guys.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked a little hurt, and I was sorry about that, but I was ready to be out
                        of that car. If
                        my mom told one more story about how cute I looked in the bathtub when I was three years old, I
                        was going to
                        burrow into the snow and freeze myself to death. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and Thalia followed me outside. The wind blew straight through my coat
                        like ice
                        daggers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Once my mother’s car was out of sight, Thalia said, “Your mom is so cool,
                        Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“She’s pretty okay,” I admitted. “What about you? You ever get in touch with
                        your mom?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As soon as I said it, I wished I hadn’t. Thalia was great at giving evil looks,
                        what with the
                        punk clothes she always wears—the ripped-up army jacket, black leather pants and chain jewelry,
                        the black
                        eyeliner and those intense blue eyes. But the look she gave me now was a perfect evil “ten.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“If that was any of your business, Percy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’d better get inside,” Annabeth interrupted. “Grover will be waiting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia looked at the castle and shivered. “You’re right. I wonder what he found
                        here that made
                        him send the distress call.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared up at the dark towers of Westover Hall. “Nothing good,” I guessed.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The oak doors groaned open, and the three of us stepped into the entry hall in
                        a swirl of snow.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">All I could say was, “Whoa.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The place was huge. The walls were lined with battle flags and weapon displays:
                        antique rifles,
                        battle axes, and a bunch of other stuff. I mean, I knew Westover was a military school and all,
                        but the
                        decorations seemed like overkill. Literally. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My hand went to my pocket, where I kept my lethal ballpoint pen, Riptide. I
                        could already sense
                        something wrong in this place. Something dangerous. Thalia was rubbing her silver bracelet, her
                        favorite magic
                        item. I knew we were thinking the same thing. A fight was coming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth started to say, “I wonder where—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The doors slammed shut behind us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oo-kay,” I mumbled. “Guess we’ll stay a while.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I could hear music echoing from the other end of the hall. It sounded like
                        dance music. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We stashed our overnight bags behind a pillar and started down the hall. We
                        hadn’t gone very
                        far when I heard footsteps on the stone floor, and a man and woman marched out of the shadows to
                        intercept us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They both had short gray hair and black military-style uniforms with red trim.
                        The woman had a
                        wispy mustache, and the guy was clean-shaven, which seemed kind of backward to me. They both
                        walked stiffly,
                        like they had broomsticks taped to their spines. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well?” the woman demanded. “What are you doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um…” I realized I hadn’t planned for this. I’d been so focused on getting to
                        Grover and
                        finding out what was wrong, I hadn’t considered that someone might question three kids sneaking
                        into the school
                        at night. We hadn’t talked at all in the car about how we would get inside. I said, “Ma’am,
                        we’re just—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ha!” the man snapped, which made me jump. “Visitors are not allowed at the
                        dance! You shall be
                        <i class="calibre5">eee-jected</i>!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He had an accent—French, maybe. He pronounced his <i class="calibre5">J
                        </i>like in <i class="calibre5">Jacques</i>. He was tall, with a hawkish face. His nostrils
                        flared when he spoke, which
                        made it really hard not to stare up his nose, and his eyes were two different colors—one brown,
                        one blue—like an
                        alley cat’s. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I figured he was about to toss us into the snow, but then Thalia stepped
                        forward and did
                        something very weird. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She snapped her fingers. The sound was sharp and loud. Maybe it was just my
                        imagination, but I
                        felt a gust of wind ripple out from her hand, across the room. It washed over all of us, making
                        the banners
                        rustle on the walls. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, but we’re not visitors, sir,” Thalia said. “We go to school here. You
                        remember: I’m
                        Thalia. And this is Annabeth and Percy. We’re in the eighth grade.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The male teacher narrowed his two-colored eyes. I didn’t know what Thalia was
                        thinking. Now
                        we’d probably get punished for lying <i class="calibre5">and </i>thrown into the snow. But the
                        man seemed to be
                        hesitating. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked at his colleague. “Ms. Gottschalk, do you know these students?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Despite the danger we were in, I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. A
                        teacher named
                        <i class="calibre5">Got Chalk</i>? He had to be kidding.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The woman blinked, like someone had just woken her up from a trance. “I…yes. I
                        believe I do,
                        sir.” She frowned at us. “Annabeth. Thalia. Percy. What are you doing away from the gymnasium?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before we could answer, I heard more footsteps, and Grover ran up, breathless.
                        “You made it!
                        You—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He stopped short when he saw the teachers. “Oh, Mrs. Gottschalk. Dr. Thorn! I,
                        uh—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What <i class="calibre5">is </i>it, Mr. Underwood?” said the man. His tone
                        made it clear that
                        he detested Grover. “What do you mean, they made it? These students live here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover swallowed. “Yes, sir. Of course, Dr. Thorn. I just meant, I’m so glad
                        they made…the
                        punch for the dance! The punch is great. And they made it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn glared at us. I decided one of his eyes had to be fake. The brown
                        one? The blue one?
                        He looked like he wanted to pitch us off the castle’s highest tower, but then Mrs. Gottschalk
                        said dreamily,
                        “Yes, the punch is excellent. Now run along, all of you. You are not to leave the gymnasium
                        again!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We didn’t wait to be told twice. We left with a lot of “Yes, ma’ams” and “Yes,
                        sirs” and a
                        couple of salutes, just because it seemed like the thing to do. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover hustled us down the hall in the direction of the music. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I could feel the teachers’ eyes on my back, but I walked closely to Thalia and
                        asked in a low
                        voice, “How did you do that finger-snap thing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You mean the Mist? Hasn’t Chiron shown you how to do that yet?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">An uncomfortable lump formed in my throat. Chiron was our head trainer at camp,
                        but he’d never
                        shown me anything like that. Why had he shown Thalia and not me? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover hurried us to a door that had <small class="calibre4">GYM</small>
                        written on the glass.
                        Even with my dyslexia, I could read that much. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That was close!” Grover said. “Thank the gods you got here!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and Thalia both hugged Grover. I gave him a big high five. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was good to see him after so many months. He’d gotten a little taller and
                        had sprouted a few
                        more whiskers, but otherwise he looked like he always did when he passed for human—a red cap on
                        his curly brown
                        hair to hide his goat horns, baggy jeans and sneakers with fake feet to hide his furry legs and
                        hooves. He was
                        wearing a black T-shirt that took me a few seconds to read. It said <small
                            class="calibre4">WESTOVER HALL:
                            GRUNT</small>. I wasn’t sure whether that was, like, Grover’s rank or maybe just the school
                        motto. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“So what’s the emergency?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover took a deep breath. “I found two.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Two half-bloods?” Thalia asked, amazed. “Here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finding one half-blood was rare enough. This year, Chiron had put the satyrs on
                        emergency
                        overtime and sent them all over the country, scouring schools from fourth grade through high
                        school for possible
                        recruits. These were desperate times. We were losing campers. We needed all the new fighters we
                        could find. The
                        problem was, there just weren’t that many demigods out there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A brother and a sister,” he said. “They’re ten and twelve. I don’t know their
                        parentage, but
                        they’re strong. We’re running out of time, though. I need help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Monsters?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“One.” Grover looked nervous. “He suspects. I don’t think he’s positive yet,
                        but this is the
                        last day of term. I’m sure he won’t let them leave campus without finding out. It may be our
                        last chance! Every
                        time I try to get close to them, he’s always there, blocking me. I don’t know what to do!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked at Thalia desperately. I tried not to feel upset by that. Used to
                        be, Grover
                        looked to me for answers, but Thalia had seniority. Not just because her dad was Zeus. Thalia
                        had more
                        experience than any of us with fending off monsters in the real world. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right,” she said. “These half-bloods are at the dance?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then let’s dance,” Thalia said. “Who’s the monster?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh,” Grover said, and looked around nervously. “You just met him. The vice
                        principal, Dr.
                        Thorn.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Weird thing about military schools: the kids go absolutely nuts when there’s a
                        special event
                        and they get to be out of uniform. I guess it’s because everything’s so strict the rest of the
                        time, they feel
                        like they’ve got to overcompensate or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There were black and red balloons all over the gym floor, and guys were kicking
                        them in each
                        other’s faces, or trying to strangle each other with the crepe-paper streamers taped to the
                        walls. Girls moved
                        around in football huddles, the way they always do, wearing lots of makeup and spaghetti-strap
                        tops and brightly
                        colored pants and shoes that looked like torture devices. Every once in a while they’d surround
                        some poor guy
                        like a pack of piranhas, shrieking and giggling, and when they finally moved on, the guy would
                        have ribbons in
                        his hair and a bunch of lipstick graffiti all over his face. Some of the older guys looked more
                        like
                        me—uncomfortable, hanging out at the edges of the gym and trying to hide, like any minute they
                        might have to
                        fight for their lives. Of course, in my case, it was true.…</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There they are.” Grover nodded toward a couple of younger kids arguing in the
                        bleachers.
                        “Bianca and Nico di Angelo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The girl wore a floppy green cap, like she was trying to hide her face. The boy
                        was obviously
                        her little brother. They both had dark silky hair and olive skin, and they used their hands a
                        lot as they
                        talked. The boy was shuffling some kind of trading cards. His sister seemed to be scolding him
                        about something.
                        She kept looking around like she sensed something was wrong. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth said, “Do they…I mean, have you told them?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover shook his head. “You know how it is. That could put them in more danger.
                        Once they
                        realize who they are, their scent becomes stronger.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked at me, and I nodded. I’d never really understood what half-bloods
                        “smell” like to
                        monsters and satyrs, but I knew that your scent could get you killed. And the more powerful a
                        demigod you
                        became, the more you smelled like a monster’s lunch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So let’s grab them and get out of here,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I started forward, but Thalia put her hand on my shoulder. The vice principal,
                        Dr. Thorn, had
                        slipped out of a doorway near the bleachers and was standing near the di Angelo siblings. He
                        nodded coldly in
                        our direction. His blue eye seemed to glow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Judging from his expression, I guessed Thorn hadn’t been fooled by Thalia’s
                        trick with the Mist
                        after all. He suspected who we were. He was just waiting to see why we were here. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t look at the kids,” Thalia ordered. “We have to wait for a chance to get
                        them. We need to
                        pretend we’re not interested in them. Throw him off the scent.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’re three powerful half-bloods. Our presence should confuse him. Mingle. Act
                        natural. Do
                        some dancing. But keep an eye on those kids.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dancing?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia nodded. She cocked her ear to the music and made a face. “Ugh. Who chose
                        the Jesse
                        McCartney?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked hurt. “I did.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh my gods, Grover. That is so lame. Can’t you play, like, Green Day or
                        something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Green who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Never mind. Let’s dance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But I can’t dance!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You can if I’m leading,” Thalia said. “Come on, goat boy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover yelped as Thalia grabbed his hand and led him onto the dance floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth smiled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nothing. It’s just cool to have Thalia back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth had grown taller than me since last summer, which I found kind of
                        disturbing. She used
                        to wear no jewelry except for her Camp Half-Blood bead necklace, but now she wore little silver
                        earrings shaped
                        like owls—the symbol of her mother, Athena. She pulled off her ski cap, and her long blond hair
                        tumbled down her
                        shoulders. It made her look older, for some reason. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So…” I tried to think of something to say. <i class="calibre5">Act
                            natural</i>, Thalia had
                        told us. When you’re a half-blood on a dangerous mission, what the heck is natural? “Um, design
                        any good
                        buildings lately?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth’s eyes lit up, the way they always did when she talked about
                        architecture. “Oh my
                        gods, Percy. At my new school, I get to take 3-D design as an elective, and there’s this cool
                        computer program…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She went on to explain how she’d designed this huge monument that she wanted to
                        build at Ground
                        Zero in Manhattan. She talked about structural supports and facades and stuff, and I tried to
                        listen. I knew she
                        wanted to be a super architect when she grew up—she loves math and historical buildings and all
                        that—but I
                        hardly understood a word she was saying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The truth was I was kind of disappointed to hear that she liked her new school
                        so much. It was
                        the first time she’d gone to school in New York. I’d been hoping to see her more often. It was a
                        boarding school
                        in Brooklyn, and she and Thalia were both attending, close enough to Camp Half-Blood that Chiron
                        could help if
                        they got in any trouble. Because it was an all-girls school, and I was going to MS-54 in
                        Manhattan, I hardly
                        ever saw them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, uh, cool,” I said. “So you’re staying there the rest of the year, huh?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her face got dark. “Well, maybe, if I don’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” Thalia called to us. She was slow dancing with Grover, who was tripping
                        all over
                        himself, kicking Thalia in the shins, and looking like he wanted to die. At least his feet were
                        fake. Unlike me,
                        he had an excuse for being clumsy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dance, you guys!” Thalia ordered. “You look stupid just standing there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked nervously at Annabeth, then at the groups of girls who were roaming
                        the gym. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well?” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, who should I ask?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She punched me in the gut. “<i class="calibre5">Me</i>, Seaweed Brain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh. Oh, right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">So we went onto the dance floor, and I looked over to see how Thalia and Grover
                        were doing
                        things. I put one hand on Annabeth’s hip, and she clasped my other hand like she was about to
                        judo throw me.
                    </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m not going to bite,” she told me. “Honestly, Percy. Don’t you guys have
                        dances at your
                        school?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t answer. The truth was we did. But I’d never, like, actually <i
                            class="calibre5">danced
                        </i>at one. I was usually one of the guys playing basketball in the corner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We shuffled around for a few minutes. I tried to concentrate on little things,
                        like the
                        crepe-paper streamers and the punch bowl—anything but the fact that Annabeth was taller than me,
                        and my hands
                        were sweaty and probably gross, and I kept stepping on her toes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What were you saying earlier?” I asked. “Are you having trouble at school or
                        something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pursed her lips. “It’s not that. It’s my dad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uh-oh.” I knew Annabeth had a rocky relationship with her father. “I thought
                        it was getting
                        better with you two. Is it your stepmom again?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth sighed. “He decided to move. Just when I was getting settled in New
                        York, he took this
                        stupid new job researching for a World War I book. In <i class="calibre5">San Francisco</i>.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She said this the same way she might say <i class="calibre5">Fields of
                            Punishment </i>or <i class="calibre5">Hades’s gym shorts</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So he wants you to move out there with him?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“To the other side of the country,” she said miserably. “And half-bloods can’t
                        live in San
                        Francisco. He should know that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What? Why not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth rolled her eyes. Maybe she thought I was kidding. “You know. It’s
                        right <i class="calibre5">there</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh,” I said. I had no idea what she was talking about, but I didn’t want to
                        sound stupid.
                        “So…you’ll go back to living at camp or what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s more serious than that, Percy. I…I probably should tell you something.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Suddenly she froze. “They’re gone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I followed her gaze. The bleachers. The two half-blood kids, Bianca and Nico,
                        were no longer
                        there. The door next to the bleachers was wide open. Dr. Thorn was nowhere in sight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We have to get Thalia and Grover!” Annabeth looked around frantically. “Oh,
                        where’d they dance
                        off to? Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She ran through the crowd. I was about to follow when a mob of girls got in my
                        way. I
                        maneuvered around them to avoid getting the ribbon-and-lipstick treatment, and by the time I was
                        free, Annabeth
                        had disappeared. I turned a full circle, looking for her or Thalia and Grover. Instead, I saw
                        something that
                        chilled my blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">About fifty feet away, lying on the gym floor, was a floppy green cap just like
                        the one Bianca
                        di Angelo had been wearing. Near it were a few scattered trading cards. Then I caught a glimpse
                        of Dr. Thorn. He
                        was hurrying out a door at the opposite end of the gym, steering the di Angelo kids by the
                        scruffs of their
                        necks, like kittens. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I still couldn’t see Annabeth, but I knew she’d be heading the other way,
                        looking for Thalia
                        and Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I almost ran after her, and then I thought, <i class="calibre5">Wait</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I remembered what Thalia had said to me in the entry hall, looking at me all
                        puzzled when I
                        asked about the finger-snap trick: <i class="calibre5">Hasn’t Chiron shown you how to do that
                            yet? </i>I thought
                        about the way Grover had turned to her, expecting her to save the day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Not that I resented Thalia. She was cool. It wasn’t her fault her dad was Zeus
                        and she got all
                        the attention.…Still, I didn’t need to run after her to solve every problem. Besides, there
                        wasn’t time. The di
                        Angelos were in danger. They might be long gone by the time I found my friends. I knew monsters.
                        I could handle
                        this myself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took Riptide out of my pocket and ran after Dr. Thorn.</p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The door led into a dark hallway. I heard sounds of scuffling up ahead, then a
                        painful grunt. I
                        uncapped Riptide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The pen grew in my hands until I held a bronze Greek sword about three-feet
                        long with a
                        leather-bound grip. The blade glowed faintly, casting a golden light on the rows of lockers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I jogged down the corridor, but when I got to the other end, no one was there.
                        I opened a door
                        and found myself back in the main entry hall. I was completely turned around. I didn’t see Dr.
                        Thorn anywhere,
                        but there on the opposite side of the room were the di Angelo kids. They stood frozen in horror,
                        staring right
                        at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I advanced slowly, lowering the tip of my sword. “It’s okay. I’m not going to
                        hurt you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They didn’t answer. Their eyes were full of fear. What was wrong with them?
                        Where was Dr.
                        Thorn? Maybe he’d sensed the presence of Riptide and retreated. Monsters hated celestial bronze
                        weapons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“My name’s Percy,” I said, trying to keep my voice level. “I’m going to take
                        you out of here,
                        get you somewhere safe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca’s eyes widened. Her fists clenched. Only too late did I realize what her
                        look meant. She
                        wasn’t afraid of me. She was trying to warn me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I whirled around and something went <i class="calibre5">WHIIISH! </i>Pain
                        exploded in my
                        shoulder. A force like a huge hand yanked me backward and slammed me to the wall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I slashed with my sword but there was nothing to hit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A cold laugh echoed through the hall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, Perseus <i class="calibre5">Jackson</i>,” Dr. Thorn said. His accent
                        mangled the <i class="calibre5">J </i>in my last name. “I know who you are.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to free my shoulder. My coat and shirt were pinned to the wall by some
                        kind of spike—a
                        black dagger-like projectile about a foot long. It had grazed the skin of my shoulder as it
                        passed through my
                        clothes, and the cut burned. I’d felt something like this before. Poison. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">I forced myself to concentrate. I would <i class="calibre5">not </i>pass out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A dark silhouette now moved toward us. Dr. Thorn stepped into the dim light. He
                        still looked
                        human, but his face was ghoulish. He had perfect white teeth and his brown/blue eyes reflected
                        the light of my
                        sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thank you for coming out of the gym,” he said. “I hate middle school dances.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to swing my sword again, but he was just out of reach. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">WHIIIISH! </i>A second projectile shot from somewhere
                        behind Dr. Thorn. He
                        didn’t appear to move. It was as if someone invisible were standing behind him, throwing knives.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Next to me, Bianca yelped. The second thorn impaled itself in the stone wall,
                        half an inch from
                        her face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All three of you will come with me,” Dr. Thorn said. “Quietly. Obediently. If
                        you make a
                        single noise, if you call out for help or try to fight, I will show you just how accurately I
                        can throw.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Maybe I could defend myself if I could get my shield activated. All that it
                        would take was a
                        touch of my wristwatch. But defending the di Angelo kids was another matter. I needed help, and
                        there was only
                        one way I could think to get it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I closed my eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What are you doing, Jackson?” hissed Dr. Thorn. “Keep moving!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I opened my eyes and kept shuffling forward. “It’s my shoulder,” I lied, trying
                        to sound
                        miserable, which wasn’t hard. “It burns.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bah! My poison causes pain. It will not kill you. Walk!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn herded us outside, and I tried to concentrate. I pictured Grover’s face.
                        I focused on my
                        feelings of fear and danger. Last summer, Grover had created an empathy link between us. He’d
                        sent me visions in
                        my dreams to let me know when he was in trouble. As far as I knew, we were still linked, but I’d
                        never tried to
                        contact Grover before. I didn’t even know if it would work while Grover was awake. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Hey, Grover! </i>I thought. <i class="calibre5">Thorn’s
                            kidnapping us! He’s
                            a poisonous spike-throwing maniac! Help! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn marched us into the woods. We took a snowy path dimly lit by
                        old-fashioned lamplights. My
                        shoulder ached. The wind blowing through my ripped clothes was so cold that I felt like a
                        Percysicle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There is a clearing ahead,” Thorn said. “We will summon your ride.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What ride?” Bianca demanded. “Where are you taking us?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Silence, you insufferable girl!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t talk to my sister that way!” Nico said. His voice quivered, but I was
                        impressed that he
                        had the guts to say anything at all. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn made a growling sound that definitely wasn’t human. It made the hairs
                        stand up on the
                        back of my neck, but I forced myself to keep walking and pretend I was being a good little
                        captive. Meanwhile, I
                        projected my thoughts like crazy—anything to get Grover’s attention: <i class="calibre5">Grover!

                    <p class="calibre13">“Halt,” Thorn said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The woods had opened up. We’d reached a cliff overlooking the sea. At least, I
                        <i class="calibre5">sensed </i>the sea was down there, hundreds of feet below. I could hear the
                        waves churning
                        and I could smell the cold salty froth. But all I could see was mist and darkness.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn pushed us toward the edge. I stumbled, and Bianca caught me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thanks,” I murmured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What <i class="calibre5">is </i>he?” she whispered. “How do we fight him?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I…I’m working on it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m scared,” Nico mumbled. He was fiddling with something—a little metal toy
                        soldier of some
                        kind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stop talking!” Dr. Thorn said. “Face me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We turned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn’s two-tone eyes glittered hungrily. He pulled something from under his
                        coat. At first I
                        thought it was a switchblade, but it was only a phone. He pressed the side button and said, “The
                        package—it is
                        ready to deliver.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a garbled reply, and I realized Thorn was in walkie-talkie mode. This
                        seemed way too
                        modern and creepy—a monster using a mobile phone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I glanced behind me, wondering how far the drop was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn laughed. “By all means, Son of Poseidon. <i class="calibre5">Jump!
                        </i>There is the
                        sea. Save yourself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What did he call you?” Bianca muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll explain later,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You do have a plan, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Grover! </i>I thought desperately. <i class="calibre5">Come
                            to me! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Maybe I could get both the di Angelos to jump with me into the ocean. If we
                        survived the fall,
                        I could use the water to protect us. I’d done things like that before. If my dad was in a good
                        mood, and
                        listening, he might help. Maybe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I would kill you before you ever reached the water,” Dr. Thorn said, as if
                        reading my
                        thoughts. “You do not realize who I am, do you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A flicker of movement behind him, and another missile whistled so close to me
                        that it nicked my
                        ear. Something had sprung up behind Dr. Thorn—like a catapult, but more flexible…almost like a
                        tail. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Unfortunately,” Thorn said, “you are wanted alive, if possible. Otherwise you
                        would already be
                        dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Who wants us?” Bianca demanded. “Because if you think you’ll get a ransom,
                        you’re wrong. We
                        don’t have any family. Nico and I…” Her voice broke a little. “We’ve got no one but each other.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Aww,” Dr. Thorn said. “Do not worry, little brats. You will be meeting my
                        employer soon
                        enough. Then you will have a brand-new family.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Luke,” I said. “You work for Luke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn’s mouth twisted with distaste when I said the name of my old enemy—a
                        former friend
                        who’d tried to kill me several times. “You have no idea what is happening, Perseus Jackson. I
                        will let the
                        General enlighten you. You are going to do him a great service tonight. He is looking forward to
                        meeting you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The General?” I asked. Then I realized I’d said it with a French accent. “I
                        mean…who’s the
                        General?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn looked toward the horizon. “Ah, here we are. Your transportation.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned and saw a light in the distance, a searchlight over the sea. Then I
                        heard the chopping
                        of helicopter blades getting louder and closer. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Where are you taking us?” Nico said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You should be honored, my boy. You will have the opportunity to join a great
                        army! Just like
                        that silly game you play with cards and dolls.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They’re not dolls! They’re figurines! And you can take your great army and—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now, now,” Dr. Thorn warned. “You will change your mind about joining us, my
                        boy. And if you
                        do not, well…there are other uses for half-bloods. We have many monstrous mouths to feed. The
                        Great Stirring is
                        underway.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Great what?” I asked. Anything to keep him talking while I tried to figure
                        out a plan.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The stirring of monsters.” Dr. Thorn smiled evilly. “The worst of them, the
                        most powerful, are
                        now waking. Monsters that have not been seen in thousands of years. They will cause death and
                        destruction the
                        likes of which mortals have never known. And soon we shall have the most important monster of
                        all—the one that
                        shall bring about the downfall of Olympus!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Okay,” Bianca whispered to me. “He’s completely nuts.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We have to jump off the cliff,” I told her quietly. “Into the sea.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, super idea. You’re completely nuts, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I never got the chance to argue with her, because just then an invisible force
                        slammed into me.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Looking back on it, Annabeth’s move was brilliant. Wearing her cap of
                        invisibility, she plowed
                        into the di Angelos and me, knocking us to the ground. For a split second, Dr. Thorn was taken
                        by surprise, so
                        his first volley of missiles zipped harmlessly over our heads. This gave Thalia and Grover a
                        chance to advance
                        from behind—Thalia wielding her magic shield, Aegis. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">If you’ve never seen Thalia run into battle, you have never been truly
                        frightened. She uses a
                        huge spear that expands from this collapsible Mace canister she carries in her pocket, but
                        that’s not the scary
                        part. Her shield is modeled after one her dad Zeus uses—also called Aegis—a gift from Athena.
                        The shield has the
                        head of the gorgon Medusa molded into the bronze, and even though it won’t turn you to stone,
                        it’s so horrible,
                        most people will panic and run at the sight of it. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/2-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Even Dr. Thorn winced and growled when he saw it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia moved in with her spear. “For Zeus!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought Dr. Thorn was a goner. Thalia jabbed at his head, but he snarled and
                        swatted the
                        spear aside. His hand changed into an orange paw, with enormous claws that sparked against
                        Thalia’s shield as he
                        slashed. If it hadn’t been for Aegis, Thalia would’ve been sliced like a loaf of bread. As it
                        was, she managed
                        to roll backward and land on her feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The sound of the helicopter was getting louder behind me, but I didn’t dare
                        look. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn launched another volley of missiles at Thalia, and this time I could
                        see how he did
                        it. He had a tail—a leathery, scorpionlike tail that bristled with spikes at the tip. The
                        missiles deflected off
                        Aegis, but the force of their impact knocked Thalia down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover sprang forward. He put his reed pipes to his lips and began to play—a
                        frantic jig that
                        sounded like something pirates would dance to. Grass broke through the snow. Within seconds,
                        rope-thick weeds
                        were wrapping around Dr. Thorn’s legs, entangling him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn roared and began to change. He grew larger until he was in his true
                        form—his face
                        still human, but his body that of a huge lion. His leathery, spiky tail whipped deadly thorns in
                        all directions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A manticore!” Annabeth said, now visible. Her magical New York Yankees cap had
                        come off when
                        she’d plowed into us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Who <i class="calibre5">are </i>you people?” Bianca di Angelo demanded. “And
                        what is <i class="calibre5">that</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A manticore?” Nico gasped. “He’s got three thousand attack power and plus five
                        to saving
                        throws!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know what he was talking about, but I didn’t have time to worry about
                        it. The
                        manticore clawed Grover’s magic weeds to shreds then turned toward us with a snarl. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/2-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get down!” Annabeth pushed the di Angelos flat into the snow. At the last
                        second, I remembered
                        my own shield. I hit my wristwatch, and metal plating spiraled out into a thick bronze shield.
                        Not a moment too
                        soon. The thorns impacted against it with such force they dented the metal. The beautiful
                        shield, a gift from my
                        brother, was badly damaged. I wasn’t sure it would even stop a second volley. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I heard a <i class="calibre5">thwack </i>and a yelp, and Grover landed next to
                        me with a thud.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yield!” the monster roared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Never!” Thalia yelled from across the field. She charged the monster, and for
                        a second, I
                        thought she would run him through. But then there was a thunderous noise and a blaze of light
                        from behind us.
                        The helicopter appeared out of the mist, hovering just beyond the cliffs. It was a sleek black
                        military-style
                        gunship, with attachments on the sides that looked like laser-guided rockets. The helicopter had
                        to be manned by
                        mortals, but what was it doing here? How could mortals be working with a monster? The
                        searchlights blinded
                        Thalia, and the manticore swatted her away with its tail. Her shield flew off into the snow. Her
                        spear flew in
                        the other direction. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” I ran out to help her. I parried away a spike just before it would’ve hit
                        her chest. I
                        raised my shield over us, but I knew it wouldn’t be enough. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn laughed. “Now do you see how hopeless it is? Yield, little heroes.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were trapped between a monster and a fully armed helicopter. We had no
                        chance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I heard a clear, piercing sound: the call of a hunting horn blowing in the
                        woods. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The manticore froze. For a moment, no one moved. There was only the swirl of
                        snow and wind and
                        the chopping of the helicopter blades. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” Dr. Thorn said. “It cannot be—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His sentence was cut short when something shot past me like a streak of
                        moonlight. A glowing
                        silver arrow sprouted from Dr. Thorn’s shoulder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He staggered backward, wailing in agony. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Curse you!” Thorn cried. He unleashed his spikes, dozens of them at once, into
                        the woods where
                        the arrow had come from, but just as fast, silvery arrows shot back in reply. It almost looked
                        like the arrows
                        had intercepted the thorns in midair and sliced them in two, but my eyes must’ve been playing
                        tricks on me. No
                        one, not even Apollo’s kids at camp, could shoot with that much accuracy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The manticore pulled the arrow out of his shoulder with a howl of pain. His
                        breathing was
                        heavy. I tried to swipe at him with my sword, but he wasn’t as injured as he looked. He dodged
                        my attack and
                        slammed his tail into my shield, knocking me aside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then the archers came from the woods. They were girls, about a dozen of them.
                        The youngest was
                        maybe ten. The oldest, about fourteen, like me. They wore silvery ski parkas and jeans, and they
                        were all armed
                        with bows. They advanced on the manticore with determined expressions. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Hunters!” Annabeth cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Next to me, Thalia muttered, “Oh, wonderful.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t have a chance to ask what she meant. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">One of the older archers stepped forward with her bow drawn. She was tall and
                        graceful with
                        coppery colored skin. Unlike the other girls, she had a silver circlet braided into the top of
                        her long dark
                        hair, so she looked like some kind of Persian princess. “Permission to kill, my lady?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/2-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t tell who she was talking to, because she kept her eyes on the
                        manticore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The monster wailed. “This is not fair! Direct interference! It is against the
                        Ancient Laws.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not so,” another girl said. This one was a little younger than me, maybe
                        twelve or thirteen.
                        She had auburn hair gathered back in a ponytail and strange eyes, silvery yellow like the moon.
                        Her face was so
                        beautiful it made me catch my breath, but her expression was stern and dangerous. “The hunting
                        of all wild
                        beasts is within my sphere. And you, foul creature, are a wild beast.” She looked at the older
                        girl with the
                        circlet. “Zoë, permission granted.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The manticore growled. “If I cannot have these alive, I shall have them dead!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He lunged at Thalia and me, knowing we were weak and dazed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Annabeth yelled, and she charged at the monster. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get back, half-blood!” the girl with the circlet said. “Get out of the line of
                        fire!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But Annabeth leaped onto the monster’s back and drove her knife into his mane.
                        The manticore
                        howled, turning in circles with his tail flailing as Annabeth hung on for dear life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Fire!” Zoë ordered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” I screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But the Hunters let their arrows fly. The first caught the manticore in the
                        neck. Another hit
                        his chest. The manticore staggered backward, wailing, “This is not the end, Huntress! You shall
                        pay!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And before anyone could react, the monster, with Annabeth still on his back,
                        leaped over the
                        cliff and tumbled into the darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I started to run after her, but our enemies weren’t done with us. There was a
                        <i class="calibre5">snap-snap-snap </i>from the helicopter—the sound of gunfire.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Most of the Hunters scattered as tiny holes appeared in the snow at their feet,
                        but the girl
                        with auburn hair just looked up calmly at the helicopter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mortals,” she announced, “are not allowed to witness my hunt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She thrust out her hand, and the helicopter exploded into dust—no, not dust.
                        The black metal
                        dissolved into a flock of birds—ravens, which scattered into the night. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/2-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The Hunters advanced on us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The one called Zoë stopped short when she saw Thalia. “You,” she said with
                        distaste. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zoë Nightshade.” Thalia’s voice trembled with anger. “Perfect timing, as
                        usual.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë scanned the rest of us. “Four half-bloods and a satyr, my lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes,” the younger girl said. “Some of Chiron’s campers, I see.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth!” I yelled. “You have to let us save her!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The auburn-haired girl turned toward me. “I’m sorry, Percy Jackson, but your
                        friend is beyond
                        help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to struggle to my feet, but a couple of the girls held me down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You are in no condition to be hurling yourself off cliffs,” the auburn-haired
                        girl said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Let me go!” I demanded. “Who do you think you are?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë stepped forward as if to smack me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” the other girl ordered. “I sense no disrespect, Zoë. He is simply
                        distraught. He does not
                        understand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The young girl looked at me, her eyes colder and brighter than the winter moon.
                        “I am Artemis,”
                        she said. “Goddess of the Hunt.” </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">After seeing Dr. Thorn turn into a monster and plummet off the edge of a cliff
                        with Annabeth,
                        you’d think nothing else could shock me. But when this twelve-year-old girl told me she was the
                        goddess Artemis,
                        I said something real intelligent like, “Um…okay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That was nothing compared to Grover. He gasped, then knelt hastily in the snow
                        and started
                        yammering, “Thank you, Lady Artemis! You’re so…you’re so…Wow!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get up, goat boy!” Thalia snapped. “We have other things to worry about.
                        Annabeth is gone!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whoa,” Bianca di Angelo said. “Hold up. Time out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everybody looked at her. She pointed her finger at all of us in turn, like she
                        was trying to
                        connect the dots. “Who…who are you people?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis’s expression softened. “It might be a better question, my dear girl, to
                        ask who are <i class="calibre5">you</i>? Who are your parents?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca glanced nervously at her brother, who was still staring in awe at
                        Artemis. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Our parents are dead,” Bianca said. “We’re orphans. There’s a bank trust that
                        pays for our
                        school, but…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She faltered. I guess she could tell from our faces that we didn’t believe her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” she demanded. “I’m telling the truth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You are a half-blood,” Zoë Nightshade said. Her accent was hard to place. It
                        sounded
                        old-fashioned, like she was reading from a really old book. “One of thy parents was mortal. The
                        other was an
                        Olympian.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“An Olympian…athlete?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” Zoë said. “One of the gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cool!” said Nico. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Bianca’s voice quavered. “This is not cool!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico danced around like he needed to use the restroom. “Does Zeus really have
                        lightning bolts
                        that do six hundred damage? Does he get extra movement points for—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nico, shut up!” Bianca put her hands to her face. “This is not your stupid
                        Mythomagic game,
                        okay? There are no gods!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As anxious as I felt about Annabeth—all I wanted to do was search for her—I
                        couldn’t help
                        feeling sorry for the di Angelos. I remembered what it was like for me when I first learned I
                        was a demigod.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia must’ve been feeling something similar, because the anger in her eyes
                        subsided a little
                        bit. “Bianca, I know it’s hard to believe. But the gods are still around. Trust me. They’re
                        immortal. And
                        whenever they have kids with regular humans, kids like us, well…Our lives are dangerous.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dangerous,” Bianca said, “like the girl who fell.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia turned away. Even Artemis looked pained. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Do not despair for Annabeth,” the goddess said. “She was a brave maiden. If
                        she can be found,
                        I shall find her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then why won’t you let us go look for her?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“She is gone. Can’t you sense it, Son of Poseidon? Some magic is at work. I do
                        not know exactly
                        how or why, but your friend has vanished.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I still wanted to jump off the cliff and search for her, but I had a feeling
                        that Artemis was
                        right. Annabeth was gone. If she’d been down there in the sea, I thought, I’d be able to feel
                        her presence. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oo!” Nico raised his hand. “What about Dr. Thorn? That was awesome how you
                        shot him with
                        arrows! Is he dead?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He was a manticore,” Artemis said. “Hopefully he is destroyed for now, but
                        monsters never
                        truly die. They re-form over and over again, and they must be hunted whenever they reappear.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Or they’ll hunt us,” Thalia said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca di Angelo shivered. “That explains…Nico, you remember last summer, those
                        guys who tried
                        to attack us in the alley in D.C.?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And that bus driver,” Nico said. “The one with the ram’s horns. I <i
                            class="calibre5">told
                        </i>you that was real.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s why Grover has been watching you,” I said. “To keep you safe, if you
                        turned out to be
                        half-bloods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grover?” Bianca stared at him. “You’re a demigod?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, a satyr, actually.” He kicked off his shoes and displayed his goat
                        hooves. I thought
                        Bianca was going to faint right there. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grover, put your shoes back on,” Thalia said. “You’re freaking her out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, my hooves are clean!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bianca,” I said, “we came here to help you. You and Nico need training to
                        survive. Dr. Thorn
                        won’t be the last monster you meet. You need to come to camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Camp?” she asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Camp Half-Blood,” I said. “It’s where half-bloods learn to survive and stuff.
                        You can join us,
                        stay there year-round if you like.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sweet, let’s go!” said Nico. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait.” Bianca shook her head. “I don’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There <i class="calibre5">is </i>another option,” Zoë said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, there isn’t!” Thalia said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia and Zoë glared at each other. I didn’t know what they were talking
                        about, but I could
                        tell there was bad history between them. For some reason, they seriously hated each other. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ve burdened these children enough,” Artemis announced. “Zoë, we will rest
                        here for a few
                        hours. Raise the tents. Treat the wounded. Retrieve our guests’ belongings from the school.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, my lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And, Bianca, come with me. I would like to speak with you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What about me?” Nico asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis considered the boy. “Perhaps you can show Grover how to play that card
                        game you enjoy.
                        I’m sure Grover would be happy to entertain you for a while…as a favor to me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover just about tripped over himself getting up. “You bet! Come on, Nico!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico and Grover walked off toward the woods, talking about hit points and armor
                        ratings and a
                        bunch of other geeky stuff. Artemis led a confused-looking Bianca along the cliff. The Hunters
                        began unpacking
                        their knapsacks and making camp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë gave Thalia one more evil look, then left to oversee things. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As soon as she was gone, Thalia stamped her foot in frustration. “The nerve of
                        those Hunters!
                        They think they’re so…Argh!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m with you,” I said. “I don’t trust—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, you’re with me?” Thalia turned on me furiously. “What were you thinking
                        back there in the
                        gym, Percy? You’d take on Dr. Thorn all by yourself ? You <i class="calibre5">knew </i>he was a
                        monster!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“If we’d stuck together, we could’ve taken him without the Hunters getting
                        involved. Annabeth
                        might still be here. Did you think of that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My jaw clenched. I thought of some harsh things to say, and I might’ve said
                        them too, but then
                        I looked down and saw something navy blue lying in the snow at my feet. Annabeth’s New York
                        Yankees baseball
                        cap. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/3-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia didn’t say another word. She wiped a tear from her cheek, turned, and
                        marched off,
                        leaving me alone with a trampled cap in the snow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The Hunters set up their camping site in a matter of minutes. Seven large
                        tents, all of silver
                        silk, curved in a crescent around one side of a bonfire. One of the girls blew a silver dog
                        whistle, and a dozen
                        white wolves appeared out of the woods. They began circling the camp like guard dogs. The
                        Hunters walked among
                        them and fed them treats, completely unafraid, but I decided I would stick close to the tents.
                        Falcons watched
                        us from the trees, their eyes flashing in the firelight, and I got the feeling they were on
                        guard duty, too.
                        Even the weather seemed to bend to the goddess’s will. The air was still cold, but the wind died
                        down and the
                        snow stopped falling, so it was almost pleasant sitting by the fire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Almost…except for the pain in my shoulder and the guilt weighing me down. I
                        couldn’t believe
                        Annabeth was gone. And as angry as I was at Thalia, I had a sinking feeling that she was right.
                        It <i class="calibre5">was </i>my fault. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">What had Annabeth wanted to tell me in the gym? <i class="calibre5">Something
                            serious</i>,
                        she’d said. Now I might never find out. I thought about how we’d danced together for half a
                        song, and my heart
                        felt even heavier. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I watched Thalia pacing in the snow at the edge of camp, walking among the
                        wolves without fear.
                        She stopped and looked back at Westover Hall, which was now completely dark, looming on the
                        hillside beyond the
                        woods. I wondered what she was thinking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Seven years ago, Thalia had been turned into a pine tree by her father, to
                        prevent her from
                        dying. She’d stood her ground against an army of monsters on top of Half-Blood Hill in order to
                        give her friends
                        Luke and Annabeth time to escape. She’d only been back as a human for a few months now, and once
                        in a while she
                        would stand so motionless you’d think she was still a tree. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally, one of the Hunters brought me my backpack. Grover and Nico came back
                        from their walk,
                        and Grover helped me fix up my wounded arm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s green!” Nico said with delight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hold still,” Grover told me. “Here, eat some ambrosia while I clean that out.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I winced as he dressed the wound, but the ambrosia square helped. It tasted
                        like homemade
                        brownie, dissolving in my mouth and sending a warm feeling through my whole body. Between that
                        and the magic
                        salve Grover used, my shoulder felt better within a couple of minutes. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/3-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico rummaged through his own bag, which the Hunters had apparently packed for
                        him, though how
                        they’d snuck into Westover Hall unseen, I didn’t know. Nico laid out a bunch of figurines in the
                        snow—little
                        battle replicas of Greek gods and heroes. I recognized Zeus with a lightning bolt, Ares with a
                        spear, Apollo
                        with his sun chariot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Big collection,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico grinned. “I’ve got almost all of them, plus their holographic cards! Well,
                        except for a
                        few really rare ones.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’ve been playing this game a long time?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Just this year. Before that…” He knit his eyebrows. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I forget. That’s weird.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked unsettled, but it didn’t last long. “Hey, can I see that sword you
                        were using?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I showed him Riptide, and explained how it turned from a pen into a sword just
                        by uncapping it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cool! Does it ever run out of ink?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, well, I don’t actually write with it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Are you really the son of Poseidon?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Can you surf really well, then?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at Grover, who was trying hard not to laugh. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Jeez, Nico,” I said. “I’ve never really tried.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He went on asking questions. Did I fight a lot with Thalia, since she was a
                        daughter of Zeus?
                        (I didn’t answer that one.) If Annabeth’s mother was Athena, the goddess of wisdom, then why
                        didn’t Annabeth
                        know better than to fall off a cliff? (I tried not to strangle Nico for asking that one.) Was
                        Annabeth my
                        girlfriend? (At this point, I was ready to stick the kid in a meat-flavored sack and throw him
                        to the wolves.)
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I figured any second he was going to ask me how many hit points I had, and I’d
                        lose my cool
                        completely, but then Zoë Nightshade came up to us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She had dark brown eyes and a slightly upturned nose. With her silver circlet
                        and her proud
                        expression, she looked so much like royalty that I had to resist the urge to sit up straight and
                        say “Yes,
                        ma’am.” She studied me distastefully, like I was a bag of dirty laundry she’d been sent to
                        fetch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come with me,” she said. “Lady Artemis wishes to speak with thee.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Zoë led me to the last tent, which looked no different from the others, and
                        waved me inside.
                        Bianca di Angelo was seated next to the auburn-haired girl, who I still had trouble thinking of
                        as Artemis. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The inside of the tent was warm and comfortable. Silk rugs and pillows covered
                        the floor. In
                        the center, a golden brazier of fire seemed to burn without fuel or smoke. Behind the goddess,
                        on a polished oak
                        display stand, was her huge silver bow, carved to resemble gazelle horns. The walls were hung
                        with animal pelts:
                        black bear, tiger, and several others I didn’t recognize. I figured an animal rights activist
                        would’ve had a
                        heart attack looking at all those rare skins, but maybe since Artemis was the goddess of the
                        hunt, she could
                        replenish whatever she shot. I thought she had another animal pelt lying next to her, and then I
                        realized it was
                        a live animal—a deer with glittering fur and silver horns, its head resting contentedly in
                        Artemis’s lap. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/3-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Join us, Percy Jackson,” the goddess said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sat across from her on the tent floor. The goddess studied me, which made me
                        uncomfortable.
                        She had such old eyes for a young girl. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Are you surprised by my age?” she asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uh…a little.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I could appear as a grown woman, or a blazing fire, or anything else I want,
                        but this is what
                        I prefer. This is the average age of my Hunters, and all young maidens for whom I am patron,
                        before they go
                        astray.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Go astray?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grow up. Become smitten with boys. Become silly, preoccupied, insecure. Forget
                        themselves.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë sat down at Artemis’s right. She glared at me as if all the stuff Artemis
                        had just said was
                        my fault, like I’d invented the idea of being a guy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You must forgive my Hunters if they do not welcome you,” Artemis said. “It is
                        very rare that
                        we would have boys in this camp. Boys are usually forbidden to have any contact with the
                        Hunters. The last one
                        to see this camp…” She looked at Zoë. “Which one was it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That boy in Colorado,” Zoë said. “You turned him into a jackalope.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah, yes.” Artemis nodded, satisfied. “I enjoy making jackalopes. At any rate,
                        Percy, I’ve
                        asked you here so that you might tell me more of the manticore. Bianca has reported some of
                        the…mmm, disturbing
                        things the monster said. But she may not have understood them. I’d like to hear them from you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And so I told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When I was done, Artemis put her hand thoughtfully on her silver bow. “I feared
                        this was the
                        answer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë sat forward. “The scent, my lady?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What scent?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Things are stirring that I have not hunted in millennia,” Artemis murmured.
                        “Prey so old I
                        have nearly forgotten.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She stared at me intently. “We came here tonight sensing the manticore, but he
                        was not the one
                        I seek. Tell me again, exactly what Dr. Thorn said.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, ‘I hate middle school dances.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no. After that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He said somebody called the General was going to explain things to me.” Zoë’s
                        face paled. She
                        turned to Artemis and started to say something, but Artemis raised her hand. “Go on, Percy,” the
                        goddess said.
                        “Well, then Thorn was talking about the Great Stir Pot—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stirring,” Bianca corrected. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah. And he said, ‘Soon we shall have the most important monster of all—the
                        one that shall
                        bring about the downfall of Olympus.’”</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The goddess was so still she could’ve been a statue. “Maybe he was lying,” I
                        said. Artemis
                        shook her head. “No. He was not. I’ve been too slow to see the signs. I must hunt this monster.”
                        Zoë looked like
                        she was trying very hard not to be afraid, but she nodded. “We will leave right away, my lady.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, Zoë. I must do this alone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But, Artemis—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This task is too dangerous even for the Hunters. You know where I must start
                        my search. You
                        cannot go there with me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“As…as you wish, my lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I will find this creature,” Artemis vowed. “And I shall bring it back to
                        Olympus by winter
                        solstice. It will be all the proof I need to convince the Council of the Gods of how much danger
                        we are in.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You know what the monster is?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis gripped her bow. “Let us pray I am wrong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Can goddesses pray?” I asked, because I’d never really thought about that.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A flicker of a smile played across Artemis’s lips. “Before I go, Percy Jackson,
                        I have a small
                        task for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Does it involve getting turned into a jackalope?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sadly, no. I want you to escort the Hunters back to Camp Half-Blood. They can
                        stay there in
                        safety until I return.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“What?” </i>Zoë blurted out. “But, Artemis, we hate that
                        place. The last
                        time we stayed there—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, I know,” Artemis said. “But I’m sure Dionysus will not hold a grudge just
                        because of a
                        little, ah, misunderstanding. It’s your right to use Cabin Eight whenever you are in need.
                        Besides, I hear they
                        rebuilt the cabins you burned down.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë muttered something about foolish campers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And now there is one last decision to make.” Artemis turned to Bianca. “Have
                        you made up your
                        mind, my girl?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca hesitated. “I’m still thinking about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait,” I said. “Thinking about what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They…they’ve invited me to join the Hunt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What? But you can’t! You have to come to Camp Half-Blood so Chiron can train
                        you. It’s the
                        only way you can learn to survive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It is <i class="calibre5">not </i>the only way for a girl,” Zoë said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t believe I was hearing this. “Bianca, camp is cool! It’s got a
                        pegasus stable and a
                        sword-fighting arena and…I mean, what do you get by joining the Hunters?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“To begin with,” Zoë said, “immortality.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at her, then at Artemis. “She’s kidding, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zoë rarely kids about anything,” Artemis said. “My Hunters follow me on my
                        adventures. They
                        are my maidservants, my companions, my sisters-in-arms. Once they swear loyalty to me, they are
                        indeed
                        immortal…unless they fall in battle, which is unlikely. Or break their oath.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What oath?” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“To foreswear romantic love forever,” Artemis said. “To never grow up, never
                        get married. To be
                        a maiden eternally.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Like you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The goddess nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to imagine what she was saying. Being immortal. Hanging out with only
                        middle-school
                        girls forever. I couldn’t get my mind around it. “So you just go around the country recruiting
                        half-bloods—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not just half-bloods,” Zoë interrupted. “Lady Artemis does not discriminate by
                        birth. All who
                        honor the goddess may join. Half-bloods, nymphs, mortals—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Which are you, then?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Anger flashed in Zoë’s eyes. “That is not thy concern, boy. The point is Bianca
                        may join if she
                        wishes. It is her choice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bianca, this is crazy,” I said. “What about your brother? Nico can’t be a
                        Hunter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Certainly not,” Artemis agreed. “He will go to camp. Unfortunately, that’s the
                        best boys can
                        do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” I protested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You can see him from time to time,” Artemis assured Bianca. “But you will be
                        free of
                        responsibility. He will have the camp counselors to take care of him. And you will have a new
                        family. Us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A new family,” Bianca repeated dreamily. “Free of responsibility.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bianca, you can’t do this,” I said. “It’s nuts.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked at Zoë. “Is it worth it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë nodded. “It is.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do I have to do?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Say this,” Zoë told her, “‘I pledge myself to the goddess Artemis.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I…I pledge myself to the goddess Artemis.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“‘I turn my back on the company of men, accept eternal maidenhood, and join the
                        Hunt.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca repeated the lines. “That’s it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë nodded. “If Lady Artemis accepts thy pledge, then it is binding.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I accept it,” Artemis said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The flames in the brazier brightened, casting a silver glow over the room.
                        Bianca looked no
                        different, but she took a deep breath and opened her eyes wide. “I feel…stronger.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/3-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Welcome, sister,” Zoë said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Remember your pledge,” Artemis said. “It is now your life.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t speak. I felt like a trespasser. And a complete failure. I couldn’t
                        believe I’d come
                        all this way and suffered so much only to lose Bianca to some eternal girls’ club. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Do not despair, Percy Jackson,” Artemis said. “You will still get to show the
                        di Angelos your
                        camp. And if Nico so chooses, he can stay there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Great,” I said, trying not to sound surly. “How are we supposed to get there?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis closed her eyes. “Dawn is approaching. Zoë, break camp. You must get to
                        Long Island
                        quickly and safely. I shall summon a ride from my brother.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë didn’t look real happy about this idea, but she nodded and told Bianca to
                        follow her. As
                        she was leaving, Bianca paused in front of me. “I’m sorry, Percy. But I want this. I really,
                        really do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then she was gone, and I was left alone with the twelve-year-old goddess. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So,” I said glumly. “We’re going to get a ride from your brother, huh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis’s silver eyes gleamed. “Yes, boy. You see, Bianca di Angelo is not the
                        only one with an
                        annoying brother. It’s time for you to meet my irresponsible twin, Apollo.” </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">Artemis assured us that dawn was coming, but you could’ve fooled me. It was
                        colder and darker
                        and snowier than ever. Up on the hill, Westover Hall’s windows were completely lightless. I
                        wondered if the
                        teachers had even noticed the di Angelos and Dr. Thorn were missing yet. I didn’t want to be
                        around when they
                        did. With my luck, the only name Mrs. Gottschalk would remember was “Percy Jackson,” and then
                        I’d be the subject
                        of a nationwide manhunt…again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Hunters broke camp as quickly as they’d set it up. I stood shivering in the
                        snow (unlike
                        the Hunters, who didn’t seem to feel at all uncomfortable), and Artemis stared into the east
                        like she was
                        expecting something. Bianca sat off to one side, talking with Nico. I could tell from his gloomy
                        face that she
                        was explaining her decision to join the Hunt. I couldn’t help thinking how selfish it was of
                        her, abandoning her
                        brother like that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia and Grover came up and huddled around me, anxious to hear what had
                        happened in my
                        audience with the goddess. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When I told them, Grover turned pale. “The last time the Hunters visited camp,
                        it didn’t go
                        well.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How’d they even show up here?” I wondered. “I mean, they just appeared out of
                        nowhere.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And Bianca <i class="calibre5">joined </i>them,” Thalia said, disgusted. “It’s
                        all Zoë’s
                        fault. That stuck-up, no good—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Who can blame her?” Grover said. “Eternity with Artemis?” He heaved a big
                        sigh. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia rolled her eyes. “You satyrs. You’re all in love with Artemis. Don’t you
                        get that she’ll
                        never love you back?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But she’s so…into nature,” Grover swooned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re nuts,” said Thalia. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nuts and berries,” Grover said dreamily. “Yeah.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Finally the sky began to lighten. Artemis muttered, “About time. He’s so-o-o
                        lazy during the
                        winter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re, um, waiting for sunrise?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“For my brother. Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t want to be rude. I mean, I knew the legends about Apollo—or sometimes
                        Helios—driving a
                        big sun chariot across the sky. But I also knew that the sun was really a star about a zillion
                        miles away. I’d
                        gotten used to some of the Greek myths being true, but still…I didn’t see how Apollo could drive
                        the sun. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s not exactly as you think,” Artemis said, like she was reading my mind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, okay.” I started to relax. “So, it’s not like he’ll be pulling up in a—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a sudden burst of light on the horizon. A blast of warmth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t look,” Artemis advised. “Not until he parks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Parks? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I averted my eyes, and saw that the other kids were doing the same. The light
                        and warmth
                        intensified until my winter coat felt like it was melting off of me. Then suddenly the light
                        died. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked. And I couldn’t believe it. It was <i class="calibre5">my </i>car.
                        Well, the car I
                        wanted, anyway. A red convertible Maserati Spyder. It was so awesome it glowed. Then I realized
                        it was glowing
                        because the metal was hot. The snow had melted around the Maserati in a perfect circle, which
                        explained why I
                        was now standing on green grass and my shoes were wet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The driver got out, smiling. He looked about seventeen or eighteen, and for a
                        second, I had the
                        uneasy feeling it was Luke, my old enemy. This guy had the same sandy hair and outdoorsy good
                        looks. But it
                        wasn’t Luke. This guy was taller, with no scar on his face like Luke’s. His smile was brighter
                        and more playful.
                        (Luke didn’t do much more than scowl and sneer these days.) The Maserati driver wore jeans and
                        loafers and a
                        sleeveless T-shirt. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Wow,” Thalia muttered. “Apollo is hot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He’s the sun god,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s not what I meant.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Little sister!” Apollo called. If his teeth were any whiter he could’ve
                        blinded us without the
                        sun car. “What’s up? You never call. You never write. I was getting worried!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis sighed. “I’m fine, Apollo. And I am not your <i class="calibre5">little
                        </i>sister.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, I was born first.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’re twins! How many millennia do we have to argue—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So what’s up?” he interrupted. “Got the girls with you, I see. You all need
                        some tips on
                        archery?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis grit her teeth. “I need a favor. I have some hunting to do, <i
                            class="calibre5">alone</i>. I need you to take my companions to Camp Half-Blood.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sure, sis!” Then he raised his hands in a <i class="calibre5">stop everything
                        </i>gesture. “I
                        feel a haiku coming on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Hunters all groaned. Apparently they’d met Apollo before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He cleared his throat and held up one hand dramatically. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“Green grass breaks through snow.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Artemis pleads for my help.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">I am so cool.”</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He grinned at us, waiting for applause. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That last line was only four syllables,” Artemis said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo frowned. “Was it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes. What about <i class="calibre5">I am so big-headed</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no, that’s six syllables. Hmm.” He started muttering to himself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë Nightshade turned to us. “Lord Apollo has been going through this haiku
                        phase ever since he
                        visited Japan. ’Tis not as bad as the time he visited Limerick. If I’d had to hear one more poem
                        that started
                        with, <i class="calibre5">There once was a goddess from Sparta—</i>” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ve got it!” Apollo announced. “<i class="calibre5">I am so awesome.
                        </i>That’s five
                        syllables!” He bowed, looking very pleased with himself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And now, sis. Transportation for the Hunters, you say? Good timing. I was just
                        about ready to
                        roll.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“These demigods will also need a ride,” Artemis said, pointing to us. “Some of
                        Chiron’s
                        campers.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No problem!” Apollo checked us out. “Let’s see…Thalia, right? I’ve heard all
                        about you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia blushed. “Hi, Lord Apollo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zeus’s girl, yes? Makes you my half sister. Used to be a tree, didn’t you?
                        Glad you’re back. I
                        hate it when pretty girls turn into trees. Man, I remember one time—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Brother,” Artemis said. “You should get going.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, right.” Then he looked at me, and his eyes narrowed. “Percy Jackson?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah. I mean…yes, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It seemed weird calling a teenager “sir,” but I’d learned to be careful with
                        immortals. They
                        tended to get offended easily. Then they blew stuff up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo studied me, but he didn’t say anything, which I found a little creepy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well!” he said at last. “We’d better load up, huh? Ride only goes one
                        way—west. And if you
                        miss it, you miss it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at the Maserati, which would seat two people max. There were about
                        twenty of us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cool car,” Nico said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thanks, kid,” Apollo said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But how will we all fit?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh.” Apollo seemed to notice the problem for the first time. “Well, yeah. I
                        hate to change out
                        of sports-car mode, but I suppose…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He took out his car keys and beeped the security alarm button. <i
                            class="calibre5">Chirp,
                            chirp. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">For a moment, the car glowed brightly again. When the glare died, the Maserati
                        had been
                        replaced by one of those Turtle Top shuttle buses like we used for school basketball games. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right,” he said. “Everybody in.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë ordered the Hunters to start loading. She picked up her camping pack, and
                        Apollo said,
                        “Here, sweetheart. Let me get that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë recoiled. Her eyes flashed murderously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Brother,” Artemis chided. “You do not help my Hunters. You do not look at,
                        talk to, or flirt
                        with my Hunters. And you do <i class="calibre5">not </i>call them sweetheart.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo spread his hands. “Sorry. I forgot. Hey, sis, where are you off to,
                        anyway?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hunting,” Artemis said. “It’s none of your business.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll find out. I see all. Know all.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis snorted. “Just drop them off, Apollo. And no messing around!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no! I never mess around.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis rolled her eyes, then looked at us. “I will see you by winter solstice.
                        Zoë, you are in
                        charge of the Hunters. Do well. Do as I would do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë straightened. “Yes, my lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis knelt and touched the ground as if looking for tracks. When she rose,
                        she looked
                        troubled. “So much danger. The beast must be found.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She sprinted toward the woods and melted into the snow and shadows. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Apollo turned and grinned, jangling the car keys on his finger. “So,” he said.
                        “Who wants to
                        drive?” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The Hunters piled into the van. They all crammed into the back so they’d be as
                        far away as
                        possible from Apollo and the rest of us highly infectious males. Bianca sat with them, leaving
                        her little
                        brother to hang in the front with us, which seemed cold to me, but Nico didn’t seem to mind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This is so cool!” Nico said, jumping up and down in the driver’s seat. “Is
                        this really the
                        sun? I thought Helios and Selene were the sun and moon gods. How come sometimes it’s them and
                        sometimes it’s you
                        and Artemis?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Downsizing,” Apollo said. “The Romans started it. They couldn’t afford all
                        those temple
                        sacrifices, so they laid off Helios and Selene and folded their duties into our job
                        descriptions. My sis got the
                        moon. I got the sun. It was pretty annoying at first, but at least I got this cool car.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But how does it work?” Nico asked. “I thought the sun was a big fiery ball of
                        gas!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo chuckled and ruffled Nico’s hair. “That rumor probably got started
                        because Artemis used
                        to call me a big fiery ball of gas. Seriously, kid, it depends on whether you’re talking
                        astronomy or
                        philosophy. You want to talk astronomy? Bah, what fun is that? You want to talk about how humans
                        <i class="calibre5">think </i>about the sun? Ah, now that’s more interesting. They’ve got a lot
                        riding on the
                        sun…er, so to speak. It keeps them warm, grows their crops, powers engines, makes everything
                        look, well,
                        sunnier. This chariot is built out of human <i class="calibre5">dreams </i>about the sun, kid.
                        It’s as old as
                        Western Civilization. Every day, it drives across the sky from east to west, lighting up all
                        those puny little
                        mortal lives. The chariot is a manifestation of the sun’s power, the way mortals perceive it.
                        Make sense?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico shook his head. “No.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well then, just think of it as a really powerful, really dangerous solar car.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Can I drive?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No. Too young.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oo! Oo!” Grover raised his hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mm, no,” Apollo said. “Too furry.” He looked past me and focused on Thalia.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Daughter of Zeus!” he said. “Lord of the sky. Perfect.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, no.” Thalia shook her head. “No, thanks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“C’mon,” Apollo said. “How old are you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia hesitated. “I don’t know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was sad, but true. She’d been turned into a tree when she was twelve, but
                        that had been
                        seven years ago. So she should be nineteen, if you went by years. But she still felt like she
                        was twelve, and if
                        you looked at her, she seemed somewhere in between. The best Chiron could figure, she had kept
                        aging while in
                        tree form, but much more slowly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo tapped his finger to his lips. “You’re fifteen, almost sixteen.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How do you know that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, I’m the god of prophecy. I know stuff. You’ll turn sixteen in about a
                        week.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s my birthday! December twenty-second.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Which means you’re old enough now to drive with a learner’s permit!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia shifted her feet nervously. “Uh—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know what you’re going to say,” Apollo said. “You don’t deserve an honor
                        like driving the
                        sun chariot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s not what I was going to say.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t sweat it! Maine to Long Island is a really short trip, and don’t worry
                        about what
                        happened to the last kid I trained. You’re Zeus’s daughter. He’s not going to blast <i

                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo laughed good-naturedly. The rest of us didn’t join him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia tried to protest, but Apollo was absolutely not going to take “no” for
                        an answer. He hit
                        a button on the dashboard, and a sign popped up along the top of the windshield. I had to read
                        it backward
                        (which, for a dyslexic, really isn’t that different than reading forward). I was pretty sure it
                        said <small class="calibre4">WARNING: STUDENT DRIVER.</small> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Take it away!” Apollo told Thalia. “You’re gonna be a natural!” </p>

                        that was a Japanese compact, and this was the sun chariot, but how different could it be? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Speed equals heat,” Apollo advised. “So start slowly, and make sure you’ve got
                        good altitude
                        before you really open her up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia gripped the wheel so tight her knuckles turned white. She looked like
                        she was going to
                        be sick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What’s wrong?” I asked her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nothing,” she said shakily. “N-nothing is wrong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pulled back on the wheel. It tilted, and the bus lurched upward so fast I
                        fell back and
                        crashed against something soft. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ow,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Slower!” Apollo said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry!” Thalia said. “I’ve got it under control!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I managed to get to my feet. Looking out the window, I saw a smoking ring of
                        trees from the
                        clearing where we’d taken off. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thalia,” I said, “lighten up on the accelerator.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ve <i class="calibre5">got </i>it, Percy,” she said, gritting her teeth. But
                        she kept it
                        floored. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Loosen up,” I told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m loose!” Thalia said. She was so stiff she looked like she was made out of
                        plywood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We need to veer south for Long Island,” Apollo said. “Hang a left.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia jerked the wheel and again threw me into Grover, who yelped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The other left,” Apollo suggested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I made the mistake of looking out the window again. We were at airplane height
                        now—so high the
                        sky was starting to look black. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah…” Apollo said, and I got the feeling he was forcing himself to sound calm.
                        “A little lower,
                        sweetheart. Cape Cod is freezing over.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia tilted the wheel. Her face was chalk white, her forehead beaded with
                        sweat. Something
                        was definitely wrong. I’d never seen her like this. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The bus pitched down and somebody screamed. Maybe it was me. Now we were
                        heading straight
                        toward the Atlantic Ocean at a thousand miles an hour, the New England coastline off to our
                        right. And it was
                        getting hot in the bus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo had been thrown somewhere in the back of the bus, but he started
                        climbing up the rows of
                        seats. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Take the wheel!” Grover begged him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No worries,” Apollo said. He looked plenty worried. “She just has to learn
                        to—WHOA!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I saw what he was seeing. Down below us was a little snow-covered New England
                        town. At least,
                        it used to be snow-covered. As I watched, the snow melted off the trees and the roofs and the
                        lawns. The white
                        steeple on a church turned brown and started to smolder. Little plumes of smoke, like birthday
                        candles, were
                        popping up all over the town. Trees and rooftops were catching fire. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/4-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Pull up!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a wild light in Thalia’s eyes. She yanked back on the wheel, and I
                        held on this time.
                        As we zoomed up, I could see through the back window that the fires in the town were being
                        snuffed out by the
                        sudden blast of cold. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There!” Apollo pointed. “Long Island, dead ahead. Let’s slow down, dear.
                        ‘Dead’ is only an
                        expression.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia was thundering toward the coastline of northern Long Island. There was
                        Camp Half-Blood:
                        the valley, the woods, the beach. I could see the dining pavilion and cabins and the
                        amphitheater. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m under control,” Thalia muttered. “I’m under control.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were only a few hundred yards away now. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Brake,” Apollo said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I can do this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“BRAKE!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia slammed her foot on the brake, and the sun bus pitched forward at a
                        forty-five-degree
                        angle, slamming into the Camp Half-Blood canoe lake with a huge <i class="calibre5">FLOOOOOOSH!
                        </i>Steam
                        billowed up, sending several frightened naiads scrambling out of the water with half-woven
                        wicker baskets. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The bus bobbed to the surface, along with a couple of capsized, half-melted
                        canoes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well,” said Apollo with a brave smile. “You were right, my dear. You had
                        everything under
                        control! Let’s go see if we boiled anyone important, shall we?” </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">I’d never seen Camp Half-Blood in winter before, and the snow surprised me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">See, the camp has the ultimate magic climate control. Nothing gets inside the
                        borders unless
                        the director, Mr. D, wants it to. I thought it would be warm and sunny, but instead the snow had
                        been allowed to
                        fall lightly. Frost covered the chariot track and the strawberry fields. The cabins were
                        decorated with tiny
                        flickering lights, like Christmas lights, except they seemed to be balls of real fire. More
                        lights glowed in the
                        woods, and weirdest of all, a fire flickered in the attic window of the Big House, where the
                        Oracle dwelt,
                        imprisoned in an old mummified body. I wondered if the spirit of Delphi was roasting
                        marshmallows up there or
                        something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whoa,” Nico said as he climbed off the bus. “Is that a climbing wall?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why is there lava pouring down it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Little extra challenge. Come on. I’ll introduce you to Chiron. Zoë, have you
                        met—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know Chiron,” Zoë said stiffly. “Tell him we will be in Cabin Eight.
                        Hunters, follow me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll show you the way,” Grover offered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We know the way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, really, it’s no trouble. It’s easy to get lost here, if you don’t”—he
                        tripped over a canoe
                        and came up still talking—“like my old daddy goat used to say! Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë rolled her eyes, but I guess she figured there was no getting rid of
                        Grover. The Hunters
                        shouldered their packs and their bows and headed off toward the cabins. As Bianca di Angelo was
                        leaving, she
                        leaned over and whispered something in her brother’s ear. She looked at him for an answer, but
                        Nico just scowled
                        and turned away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Take care, sweethearts!” Apollo called after the Hunters. He winked at me.
                        “Watch out for
                        those prophecies, Percy. I’ll see you soon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Instead of answering, he hopped back in the bus. “Later, Thalia,” he called.
                        “And, uh, be
                        good!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He gave her a wicked smile, as if he knew something she didn’t. Then he closed
                        the doors and
                        revved the engine. I turned aside as the sun chariot took off in a blast of heat. When I looked
                        back, the lake
                        was steaming. A red Maserati soared over the woods, glowing brighter and climbing higher until
                        it disappeared in
                        a ray of sunlight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico was still looking grumpy. I wondered what his sister had told him. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Who’s Chiron?” he asked. “I don’t have his figurine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Our activities director,” I said. “He’s…well, you’ll see.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If those Hunter girls don’t like him,” Nico grumbled, “that’s good enough for
                        me. Let’s go.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The second thing that surprised me about camp was how empty it was. I mean, I
                        knew most
                        half-bloods only trained during the summer. Just the year-rounders would be here—the ones who
                        didn’t have homes
                        to go to, or would get attacked by monsters too much if they left. But there didn’t even seem to
                        be many of
                        them, either. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I spotted Charles Beckendorf from the Hephaestus cabin stoking the forge
                        outside the camp
                        armory. The Stoll brothers, Travis and Connor, from the Hermes cabin, were picking the lock on
                        the camp store. A
                        few kids from the Ares cabin were having a snowball fight with the wood nymphs at the edge of
                        the forest. That
                        was about it. Even my old rival from the Ares cabin, Clarisse, didn’t seem to be around. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Big House was decorated with strings of red and yellow fireballs that
                        warmed the porch but
                        didn’t seem to catch anything on fire. Inside, flames crackled in the hearth. The air smelled
                        like hot
                        chocolate. Mr. D, the camp director, and Chiron were playing a quiet game of cards in the
                        parlor. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron’s brown beard was shaggier for the winter. His curly hair had grown a
                        little longer. He
                        wasn’t posing as a teacher this year, so I guess he could afford to be casual. He wore a fuzzy
                        sweater with a
                        hoofprint design on it, and he had a blanket on his lap that almost hid his wheelchair
                        completely. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He smiled when he saw us. “Percy! Thalia! Ah, and this must be—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nico di Angelo,” I said. “He and his sister are half-bloods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron breathed a sigh of relief. “You succeeded, then.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His smile melted. “What’s wrong? And where is Annabeth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, dear,” Mr. D said in a bored voice. “Not another one lost.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I’d been trying not to pay attention to Mr. D, but he was kind of hard to
                        ignore in his neon
                        orange leopard-skin warm-up suit and his purple running shoes. (Like Mr. D had ever run a day in
                        his immortal
                        life.) A golden laurel wreath was tilted sideways on his curly black hair, which must’ve meant
                        he’d won the last
                        hand of cards. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” Thalia asked. “Who else is lost?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Just then, Grover trotted into the room, grinning like crazy. He had a black
                        eye and red lines
                        on his face that looked like a slap mark. “The Hunters are all moved in!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron frowned. “The Hunters, eh? I see we have much to talk about.” He glanced
                        at Nico.
                        “Grover, perhaps you should take our young friend to the den and show him our orientation film.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But…Oh, right. Yes, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Orientation film?” Nico asked. “Is it G or PG? ’Cause Bianca is kinda strict—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s PG-13,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cool!” Nico happily followed him out of the room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now,” Chiron said to Thalia and me, “perhaps you two should sit down and tell
                        us the whole
                        story.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When we were done, Chiron turned to Mr. D. “We should launch a search for
                        Annabeth
                        immediately.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll go,” Thalia and I said at the same time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D sniffed. “Certainly not!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia and I both started complaining, but Mr. D held up his hand. He had that
                        purplish angry
                        fire in his eyes that usually meant something bad and godly was going to happen if we didn’t
                        shut up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“From what you have told me,” Mr. D said, “we have broken even on this
                        escapade. We have, ah,
                        regrettably lost Annie Bell—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth,” I snapped. She’d gone to camp since she was seven, and still Mr. D
                        pretended not to
                        know her name. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, yes,” he said. “And you procured a small annoying boy to replace her. So
                        I see no point
                        risking further half-bloods on a ridiculous rescue. The possibility is very great that this
                        Annie girl is dead.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to strangle Mr. D. It wasn’t fair Zeus had sent him here to dry out as
                        camp director
                        for a hundred years. It was meant to be a punishment for Mr. D’s bad behavior on Olympus, but it
                        ended up being
                        a punishment for all of us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth may be alive,” Chiron said, but I could tell he was having trouble
                        sounding upbeat.
                        He’d practically raised Annabeth all those years she was a year-round camper, before she’d given
                        living with her
                        dad and stepmom a second try. “She’s very bright. If…if our enemies have her, she will try to
                        play for time. She
                        may even pretend to cooperate.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s right,” Thalia said. “Luke would want her alive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“In which case,” said Mr. D, “I’m afraid she will have to be smart enough to
                        escape on her
                        own.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I got up from the table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy.” Chiron’s tone was full of warning. In the back of my mind, I knew Mr.
                        D was not
                        somebody to mess with. Even if you were an impulsive ADHD kid like me, he wouldn’t give you any
                        slack. But I was
                        so angry I didn’t care. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re glad to lose another camper,” I said. “You’d like it if we all
                        disappeared!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D stifled a yawn. “You have a point?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I growled. “Just because you were sent here as a punishment doesn’t
                        mean you have to be
                        a lazy jerk! This is your civilization, too. Maybe you could try helping out a little!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">For a second, there was no sound except the crackle of the fire. The light
                        reflected in Mr. D’s
                        eyes, giving him a sinister look. He opened his mouth to say something—probably a curse that
                        would blast me to
                        smithereens—when Nico burst into the room, followed by Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“SO COOL!” Nico yelled, holding his hands out to Chiron. “You’re…you’re a
                        centaur!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron managed a nervous smile. “Yes, Mr. di Angelo, if you please. Though, I
                        prefer to stay in
                        human form in this wheelchair for, ah, first encounters.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And, whoa!” He looked at Mr. D. “You’re the wine dude? No way!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D turned his eyes away from me and gave Nico a look of loathing. “The wine
                        dude?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dionysus, right? Oh, wow! I’ve got your figurine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“My figurine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“In my game, Mythomagic. And a holofoil card, too! And even though you’ve only
                        got like five
                        hundred attack points and everybody thinks you’re the lamest god card, I totally think your
                        powers are sweet!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah.” Mr. D seemed truly perplexed, which probably saved my life. “Well,
                        that’s…gratifying.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” Chiron said quickly, “you and Thalia go down to the cabins. Inform the
                        campers we’ll
                        be playing capture the flag tomorrow evening.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Capture the flag?” I asked. “But we don’t have enough—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It is a tradition,” Chiron said. “A friendly match, whenever the Hunters
                        visit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” Thalia muttered. “I bet it’s real friendly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron jerked his head toward Mr. D, who was still frowning as Nico talked
                        about how many
                        defense points all the gods had in his game. “Run along now,” Chiron told us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, right,” Thalia said. “Come on, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She hauled me out of the Big House before Dionysus could remember that he
                        wanted to kill me.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">“You’ve already got Ares on your bad side,” Thalia reminded me as we trudged
                        toward the cabins.
                        “You need another immortal enemy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She was right. My first summer as a camper, I’d gotten in a fight with Ares,
                        and now he and all
                        his children wanted to kill me. I didn’t need to make Dionysus mad, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry,” I said. “I couldn’t help it. It’s just so unfair.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She stopped by the armory and looked out across the valley, toward the top of
                        Half-Blood Hill.
                        Her pine tree was still there, the Golden Fleece glittering in its lowest branch. The tree’s
                        magic still
                        protected the borders of camp, but it no longer used Thalia’s spirit for power. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, everything is unfair,” Thalia muttered. “Sometimes I wish…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She didn’t finish, but her tone was so sad I felt sorry for her. With her
                        ragged black hair and
                        her black punk clothes, an old wool overcoat wrapped around her, she looked like some kind of
                        huge raven,
                        completely out of place in the white landscape. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll get Annabeth back,” I promised. “I just don’t know how yet.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“First I found out that Luke is lost,” she said. “Now Annabeth—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t think like that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re right.” She straightened up. “We’ll find a way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Over at the basketball court, a few of the Hunters were shooting hoops. One of
                        them was arguing
                        with a guy from the Ares cabin. The Ares kid had his hand on his sword and the Hunter girl
                        looked like she was
                        going to exchange her basketball for a bow and arrow any second. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll break that up,” Thalia said. “You circulate around the cabins. Tell
                        everybody about
                        capture the flag tomorrow.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right. You should be team captain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no,” she said. “You’ve been at camp longer. You do it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We can, uh…co-captain or something.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked about as comfortable with that as I felt, but she nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As she headed for the court, I said, “Hey, Thalia.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m sorry about what happened at Westover. I should’ve waited for you guys.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“’S okay, Percy. I probably would’ve done the same thing.” She shifted from
                        foot to foot, like
                        she was trying to decide whether or not to say more. “You know, you asked about my mom and I
                        kinda snapped at
                        you. It’s just…I went back to find her after seven years, and I found out she died in Los
                        Angeles. She, um…she
                        was a heavy drinker, and apparently she was out driving late one night about two years ago,
                        and…” Thalia blinked
                        hard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, well. It’s…it’s not like we were ever close. I ran away when I was ten.
                        Best two years
                        of my life were when I was running around with Luke and Annabeth. But still—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s why you had trouble with the sun van.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She gave me a wary look. “What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The way you stiffened up. You must’ve been thinking about your mom, not
                        wanting to get behind
                        the wheel.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was sorry I’d said anything. Thalia’s expression was dangerously close to
                        Zeus’s, the one
                        time I’d seen him get angry—like any minute, her eyes would shoot a million volts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” she muttered. “Yeah, that must’ve been it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She trudged off toward the court, where the Ares camper and the Hunter were
                        trying to kill each
                        other with a sword and a basketball. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The cabins were the weirdest collection of buildings you’ve ever seen. Zeus and
                        Hera’s big
                        white-columned buildings, Cabins One and Two, stood in the middle, with five gods’ cabins on the
                        left and five
                        goddesses’ cabins on the right, so they all made a U around the central green and the barbecue
                        hearth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I made the rounds, telling everybody about capture the flag. I woke up some
                        Ares kid from his
                        midday nap and he yelled at me to go away. When I asked him where Clarisse was he said, “Went on
                        a quest for
                        Chiron. Top secret!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Is she okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Haven’t heard from her in a month. She’s missing in action. Like your butt’s
                        gonna be if you
                        don’t get outta here!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I decided to let him go back to sleep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally I got to Cabin Three, the cabin of Poseidon. It was a low gray building
                        hewn from sea
                        stone, with shells and coral fossils imprinted in the rock. Inside, it was just as empty as
                        always, except for
                        my bunk. A Minotaur horn hung on the wall next to my pillow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I took Annabeth’s baseball cap out of my backpack and set it on my nightstand.
                        I’d give it to
                        her when I found her. And I <i class="calibre5">would </i>find her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I took off my wristwatch and activated the shield. It creaked noisily as it
                        spiraled out. Dr.
                        Thorn’s spikes had dented the brass in a dozen places. One gash kept the shield from opening all
                        the way, so it
                        looked like a pizza with two slices missing. The beautiful metal pictures that my brother had
                        crafted were all
                        banged up. In the picture of me and Annabeth fighting the Hydra, it looked like a meteor had
                        made a crater in my
                        head. I hung the shield on its hook, next to the Minotaur horn, but it was painful to look at
                        now. Maybe
                        Beckendorf from the Hephaestus cabin could fix it for me. He was the best armorsmith in the
                        camp. I’d ask him at
                        dinner. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I was staring at the shield when I noticed a strange sound—water gurgling—and I
                        realized there
                        was something new in the room. At the back of the cabin was a big basin of gray sea rock, with a
                        spout like the
                        head of a fish carved in stone. Out of its mouth burst a stream of water, a saltwater spring
                        that trickled into
                        the pool. The water must’ve been hot, because it sent mist into the cold winter air like a
                        sauna. It made the
                        room feel warm and summery, fresh with the smell of the sea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stepped up to the pool. There was no note attached or anything, but I knew it
                        could only be a
                        gift from Poseidon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked into the water and said, “Thanks, Dad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The surface rippled. At the bottom of the pool, coins shimmered—a dozen or so
                        golden drachma. I
                        realized what the fountain was for. It was a reminder to keep in touch with my family. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I opened the nearest window, and the wintry sunlight made a rainbow in the
                        mist. Then I fished
                        a coin out of the hot water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Iris, O Goddess of the Rainbow,” I said, “accept my offering.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tossed a coin into the mist and it disappeared. Then I realized I didn’t know
                        who to contact
                        first. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mom? That would’ve been the “good son” thing to do, but she wouldn’t be
                        worried about me
                        yet. She was used to me disappearing for days or weeks at a time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My father? It had been way too long, almost two years, since I’d actually
                        talked to him. But
                        could you even send an Iris-message to a god? I’d never tried. Would it make them mad, like a
                        sales call or
                        something? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hesitated. Then I made up my mind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Show me Tyson,” I requested. “At the forges of the Cyclopes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The mist shimmered, and the image of my half brother appeared. He was
                        surrounded in fire, which
                        would’ve been a problem if he weren’t a Cyclops. He was bent over an anvil, hammering a red-hot
                        sword blade.
                        Sparks flew and flames swirled around his body. There was a marble-framed window behind him, and
                        it looked out
                        onto dark blue water—the bottom of the ocean. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He didn’t hear me at first because of the hammering and the roar of the flames.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“TYSON!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He turned, and his one enormous eye widened. His face broke into a crooked
                        yellow grin.
                        “Percy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He dropped the sword blade and ran at me, trying to give me a hug. The vision
                        blurred and I
                        instinctively lurched back. “Tyson, it’s an Iris-message. I’m not really here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh.” He came back into view, looking embarrassed. “Oh, I knew that. Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How are you?” I asked. “How’s the job?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His eye lit up. “Love the job! Look!” He picked up the hot sword blade with his
                        bare hands. “I
                        made this!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s really cool.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I wrote my name on it. Right there.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Awesome. Listen, do you talk to Dad much?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson’s smile faded. “Not much. Daddy is busy. He is worried about the war.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson sighed. He stuck the sword blade out the window, where it made a cloud of
                        boiling
                        bubbles. When Tyson brought it back in, the metal was cool. “Old sea spirits making trouble.
                        Aigaios. Oceanus.
                        Those guys.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sort of knew what he was talking about. He meant the immortals who ruled the
                        oceans back in
                        the days of the Titans. Before the Olympians took over. The fact that they were back now, with
                        the Titan Lord
                        Kronos and his allies gaining strength, was not good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Is there anything I can do?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson shook his head sadly. “We are arming the mermaids. They need a thousand
                        more swords by
                        tomorrow.” He looked at his sword blade and sighed. “Old spirits are protecting the bad boat.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>?” I said. “Luke’s boat?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes. They make it hard to find. Protect it from Daddy’s storms. Otherwise he
                        would smash it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Smashing it would be good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson perked up, as if he’d just had another thought. “Annabeth! Is she there?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, well…” My heart felt like a bowling ball. Tyson thought Annabeth was just
                        about the
                        coolest thing since peanut butter (and he seriously loved peanut butter). I didn’t have the
                        heart to tell him
                        she was missing. He’d start crying so bad he’d probably put out his fires. “Well, no…she’s not
                        here right now.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tell her hello!” He beamed. “Hello to Annabeth!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Okay.” I fought back a lump in my throat. “I’ll do that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And, Percy, don’t worry about the bad boat. It is going away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Panama Canal! Very far away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I frowned. Why would Luke take his demon-infested cruise ship all the way down
                        there? The last
                        time we’d seen him, he’d been cruising along the East Coast, recruiting half-bloods and training
                        his monstrous
                        army. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right,” I said, not feeling reassured. “That’s…good. I guess.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In the forges, a deep voice bellowed something I couldn’t make out. Tyson
                        flinched. “Got to get
                        back to work! Boss will get mad. Good luck, Brother!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ok, tell Dad—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But before I could finish, the vision shimmered and faded. I was alone again in
                        my cabin,
                        feeling even lonelier than before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I was pretty miserable at dinner that night. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I mean, the food was excellent as usual. You can’t go wrong with barbecue,
                        pizza, and
                        never-empty soda goblets. The torches and braziers kept the outdoor pavilion warm, but we all
                        had to sit with
                        our cabin mates, which meant I was alone at the Poseidon table. Thalia sat alone at the Zeus
                        table, but we
                        couldn’t sit together. Camp rules. At least the Hephaestus, Ares, and Hermes cabins had a few
                        people each. Nico
                        sat with the Stoll brothers, since new campers always got stuck in the Hermes cabin if their
                        Olympian parent was
                        unknown. The Stoll brothers seemed to be trying to convince Nico that poker was a much better
                        game than
                        Mythomagic. I hoped Nico didn’t have any money to lose. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The only table that really seemed to be having a good time was the Artemis
                        table. The Hunters
                        drank and ate and laughed like one big happy family. Zoë sat at the head like she was the mama.
                        She didn’t laugh
                        as much as the others, but she did smile from time to time. Her silver lieutenant’s band
                        glittered in the dark
                        braids of her hair. I thought she looked a lot nicer when she smiled. Bianca di Angelo seemed to
                        be having a
                        great time. She was trying to learn how to arm wrestle from the big girl who’d picked a fight
                        with the Ares kid
                        on the basketball court. The bigger girl was beating her every time, but Bianca didn’t seem to
                        mind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When we’d finished eating, Chiron made the customary toast to the gods and
                        formally welcomed
                        the Hunters of Artemis. The clapping was pretty half hearted. Then he announced the “good will”
                        capture-the-flag
                        game for tomorrow night, which got a lot better reception. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Afterward, we all trailed back to our cabins for an early, winter lights out. I
                        was exhausted,
                        which meant I fell asleep easily. That was the good part. The bad part was, I had a nightmare,
                        and even by my
                        standards it was a whopper. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Annabeth was on a dark hillside, shrouded in fog. It almost seemed like the
                        Underworld, because
                        I immediately felt claustrophobic and I couldn’t see the sky above—just a close, heavy darkness,
                        as if I were in
                        a cave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth struggled up the hill. Old broken Greek columns of black marble were
                        scattered around,
                        as though something had blasted a huge building to ruins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thorn!” Annabeth cried. “Where are you? Why did you bring me here?” She
                        scrambled over a
                        section of broken wall and came to the crest of the hill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was Luke. And he was in pain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He was crumpled on the rocky ground, trying to rise. The blackness seemed to be
                        thicker around
                        him, fog swirling hungrily. His clothes were in tatters and his face was scratched and drenched
                        with sweat. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth!” he called. “Help me! Please!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She ran forward. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to cry out: <i class="calibre5">He’s a traitor! Don’t trust him! </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But my voice didn’t work in the dream. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth had tears in her eyes. She reached down like she wanted to touch
                        Luke’s face, but at
                        the last second she hesitated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What happened?” she asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They left me here,” Luke groaned. “Please. It’s killing me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t see what was wrong with him. He seemed to be struggling against some
                        invisible
                        curse, as though the fog were squeezing him to death. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why should I trust you?” Annabeth asked. Her voice was filled with hurt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You shouldn’t,” Luke said. “I’ve been terrible to you. But if you don’t help
                        me, I’ll die.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Let him die, </i>I wanted to scream. Luke had tried to kill
                        us in cold
                        blood too many times. He didn’t deserve anything from Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then the darkness above Luke began to crumble, like a cavern roof in an
                        earthquake. Huge chunks
                        of black rock began falling. Annabeth rushed in just as a crack appeared, and the whole ceiling
                        dropped. She
                        held it somehow—tons of rock. She kept it from collapsing on her and Luke just with her own
                        strength. It was
                        impossible. She shouldn’t have been able to do that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke rolled free, gasping. “Thanks,” he managed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Help me hold it,” Annabeth groaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke caught his breath. His face was covered in grime and sweat. He rose
                        unsteadily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I knew I could count on you.” He began to walk away as the trembling blackness
                        threatened to
                        crush Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“HELP ME!” she pleaded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, don’t worry,” Luke said. “Your help is on the way. It’s all part of the
                        plan. In the
                        meantime, try not to die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The ceiling of darkness began to crumble again, pushing Annabeth against the

                        gurgle of the saltwater spring. The clock on my nightstand read just after midnight. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">The next morning after breakfast, I told Grover about my dream. We sat in the
                        meadow watching
                        the satyrs chase the wood nymphs through the snow. The nymphs had promised to kiss the satyrs if
                        they got
                        caught, but they hardly ever did. Usually the nymph would let the satyr get up a full head of
                        steam, then she’d
                        turn into a snow-covered tree and the poor satyr would slam into it headfirst and get a pile of
                        snow dumped on
                        him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When I told Grover my nightmare, he started twirling his finger in his shaggy
                        leg fur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A cave ceiling collapsed on her?” he asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah. What the heck does that mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover shook his head. “I don’t know. But after what Zoë dreamed—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whoa. What do you mean? Zoë had a dream like that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I…I don’t know, exactly. About three in the morning she came to the Big House
                        and demanded to
                        talk to Chiron. She looked really panicked.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait, how do you know this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover blushed. “I was sort of camped outside the Artemis cabin.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Just to be, you know, near them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re a stalker with hooves.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/6-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“I am not! Anyway, I followed her to the Big House and hid in a bush and
                        watched the whole
                        thing. She got real upset when Argus wouldn’t let her in. It was kind of a dangerous scene.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to imagine that. Argus was the head of security for camp—a big blond
                        dude with eyes all
                        over his body. He rarely showed himself unless something serious was going on. I wouldn’t want
                        to place bets on
                        a fight between him and Zoë Nightshade. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What did she say?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover grimaced. “Well, she starts talking really old-fashioned when she gets
                        upset, so it was
                        kind of hard to understand. But something about Artemis being in trouble and needing the
                        Hunters. And then she
                        called Argus a boil-brained lout…I think that’s a bad thing. And then he called her—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whoa, wait. How could Artemis be in trouble?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I…well, finally Chiron came out in his pajamas and his horse tail in curlers
                        and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He wears curlers in his tail?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover covered his mouth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry,” I said. “Go on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, Zoë said she needed permission to leave camp immediately. Chiron
                        refused. He reminded
                        Zoë that the Hunters were supposed to stay here until they received orders from Artemis. And she
                        said…” Grover
                        gulped. “She said ‘How are we to get orders from Artemis if Artemis is lost?’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean lost? Like she needs directions?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No. I think she meant gone. Taken. Kidnapped.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“Kidnapped?” </i>I tried to get my mind around that idea.
                        “How would you
                        kidnap an immortal goddess? Is that even possible?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, yeah. I mean, it happened to Persephone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But she was like, the goddess of <i class="calibre5">flowers</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked offended. “Springtime.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whatever. Artemis is a lot more powerful than that. Who could kidnap her? And
                        why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover shook his head miserably. “I don’t know. Kronos?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He can’t be that powerful already. Can he?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The last time we’d seen Kronos, he’d been in tiny pieces. Well…we hadn’t
                        actually <i class="calibre5">seen </i>him. Thousands of years ago, after the big Titan–God war,
                        the gods had sliced him
                        to bits with his own scythe and scattered his remains in Tartarus, which is like the gods’
                        bottomless recycling
                        bin for their enemies. Two summers ago, Kronos had tricked us to the very edge of the pit and
                        almost pulled us
                        in. Then last summer, on board Luke’s demon cruise ship, we’d seen a golden coffin, where Luke
                        claimed he was
                        summoning the Titan Lord out of the abyss, bit by bit, every time someone new joined their
                        cause. Kronos could
                        influence people with dreams and trick them, but I didn’t see how he could physically overcome
                        Artemis if he was
                        still like a pile of evil bark mulch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t know,” Grover said. “I think somebody would know if Kronos had
                        re-formed. The gods
                        would be more nervous. But still, it’s weird, you having a nightmare the same night as Zoë. It’s
                        almost like—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They’re connected,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Over in the frozen meadow, a satyr skidded on his hooves as he chased after a
                        redheaded tree
                        nymph. She giggled and held out her arms as he ran toward her. <i class="calibre5">Pop! </i>She
                        turned into a
                        Scotch pine and he kissed the trunk at top speed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah, love,” Grover said dreamily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought about Zoë’s nightmare, which she’d had only a few hours after mine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ve got to talk to Zoë,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, before you do…” Grover took something out of his coat pocket. It was a
                        three-fold display
                        like a travel brochure. “You remember what you said—about how it was weird the Hunters just
                        happened to show up
                        at Westover Hall? I think they might’ve been scouting us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Scouting us? What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He gave me the brochure. It was about the Hunters of Artemis. The front read,
                        <small class="calibre4">A WISE CHOICE FOR YOUR FUTURE</small>! Inside were pictures of young
                        maidens doing hunter
                        stuff, chasing monsters, shooting bows. There were captions like: <small class="calibre4">HEALTH
                            BENEFITS:
                            IMMORTALITY AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU!</small> and <small class="calibre4">A BOY-FREE
                            TOMORROW!</small>
                    </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“I found that in Annabeth’s backpack,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at him. “I don’t understand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, it seems to me…maybe Annabeth was thinking about joining.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I’d like to say I took the news well. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The truth was, I wanted to strangle the Hunters of Artemis one eternal maiden
                        at a time. The
                        rest of the day I tried to keep busy, but I was worried sick about Annabeth. I went to
                        javelin-throwing class,
                        but the Ares camper in charge chewed me out after I got distracted and threw the javelin at the
                        target before he
                        got out of the way. I apologized for the hole in his pants, but he still sent me packing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I visited the pegasus stables, but Silena Beauregard from the Aphrodite cabin
                        was having an
                        argument with one of the Hunters, and I decided I’d better not get involved. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">After that, I sat in the empty chariot stands and sulked. Down at the archery
                        fields, Chiron
                        was conducting target practice. I knew he’d be the best person to talk to. Maybe he could give
                        me some advice,
                        but something held me back. I had a feeling Chiron would try to protect me, like he always did.
                        He might not
                        tell me everything he knew. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked the other direction. At the top of Half-Blood Hill, Mr. D and Argus
                        were feeding the
                        baby dragon that guarded the Golden Fleece. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then it occurred to me: no one would be in the Big House. There was someone
                        else…some<i class="calibre5">thing </i>else I could ask for guidance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My blood was humming in my ears as I ran into the house and took the stairs.
                        I’d only done this
                        once before, and I still had nightmares about it. I opened the trap door and stepped into the
                        attic. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The room was dark and dusty and cluttered with junk, just like I remembered.
                        There were shields
                        with monster bites out of them, and swords bent in the shapes of daemon heads, and a bunch of
                        taxidermy, like a
                        stuffed harpy and a bright orange python. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Over by the window, sitting on a three-legged stool, was the shriveled-up mummy
                        of an old lady
                        in a tie-dyed hippie dress. The Oracle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I made myself walk toward her. I waited for green mist to billow from the
                        mummy’s mouth, like
                        it had before, but nothing happened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hi,” I said. “Uh, what’s up?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I winced at how stupid that sounded. Not much could be “up” when you’re dead
                        and stuck in the
                        attic. But I knew the spirit of the Oracle was in there somewhere. I could feel a cold presence
                        in the room,
                        like a coiled sleeping snake. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I have a question,” I said a little louder. “I need to know about Annabeth.
                        How can I save
                        her?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">No answer. The sun slanted through the dirty attic window, lighting the dust
                        motes dancing in
                        the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I waited longer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I got angry. I was being stonewalled by a corpse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right,” I said. “Fine. I’ll figure it out myself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned and bumped into a big table full of souvenirs. It seemed more
                        cluttered than the last
                        time I was here. Heroes stored all kinds of stuff in the attic: quest trophies they no longer
                        wanted to keep in
                        their cabins, or stuff that held painful memories. I knew Luke had stored a dragon claw
                        somewhere up here—the
                        one that had scarred his face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a broken sword hilt labeled: <i class="calibre5">This broke and Leroy
                            got killed.
                            1999. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I noticed a pink silk scarf with a label attached to it. I picked up the
                        tag and tried to
                        read it: </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at the scarf. I’d totally forgotten about it. Two years ago, Annabeth
                        had ripped this
                        scarf out of my hands and said something like, <i class="calibre5">Oh, no. No love magic for
                            you! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I’d just assumed she’d thrown it away. And yet here it was. She’d kept it all
                        this time? And
                        why had she stashed it in the attic? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned to the mummy. She hadn’t moved, but the shadows across her face made
                        it look like she
                        was smiling gruesomely. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I dropped the scarf and tried not to run toward the exit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">That night after dinner, I was seriously ready to beat the Hunters at capture
                        the flag. It was
                        going to be a small game: only thirteen Hunters, including Bianca di Angelo, and about the same
                        number of
                        campers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë Nightshade looked pretty upset. She kept glancing resentfully at Chiron,
                        like she couldn’t
                        believe he was making her do this. The other Hunters didn’t look too happy, either. Unlike last
                        night, they
                        weren’t laughing or joking around. They just huddled together in the dining pavilion, whispering
                        nervously to
                        each other as they strapped on their armor. Some of them even looked like they’d been crying. I
                        guess Zoë had
                        told them about her nightmare. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">On our team, we had Beckendorf and two other Hephaestus guys, a few from the
                        Ares cabin (though
                        it still seemed strange that Clarisse wasn’t around), the Stoll brothers and Nico from Hermes
                        cabin, and a few
                        Aphrodite kids. It was weird that the Aphrodite cabin wanted to play. Usually they sat on the
                        sidelines,
                        chatted, and checked their reflections in the river and stuff, but when they heard we were
                        fighting the Hunters,
                        they were raring to go. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll show them ‘love is worthless,’” Silena Beauregard grumbled as she
                        strapped on her armor.
                        “I’ll pulverize them!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That left Thalia and me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll take the offense,” Thalia volunteered. “You take defense.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh.” I hesitated, because I’d been about to say the exact same thing, only
                        reversed. “Don’t
                        you think with your shield and all, you’d be better defense?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia already had Aegis on her arm, and even our own teammates were giving her
                        a wide berth,
                        trying not to cower before the bronze head of Medusa. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, I was thinking it would make better offense,” Thalia said. “Besides,
                        you’ve had more
                        practice at defense.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wasn’t sure if she was teasing me. I’d had some pretty bad experiences with
                        defense on
                        capture the flag. My first year, Annabeth had put me out as a kind of bait, and I’d almost been
                        gored to death
                        with spears and killed by a hellhound. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, no problem,” I lied. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cool.” Thalia turned to help some of the Aphrodite kids, who were having
                        trouble suiting up
                        their armor without breaking their nails. Nico di Angelo ran up to me with a big grin on his
                        face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, this is awesome!” His blue-feathered bronze helmet was falling in his
                        eyes, and his
                        breastplate was about six sizes too big. I wondered if there was any way I’d looked that
                        ridiculous when I’d
                        first arrived. Unfortunately, I probably had. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico lifted his sword with effort. “Do we get to kill the other team?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/6-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well…no.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But the Hunters are immortal, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s only if they don’t fall in battle. Besides—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It would be awesome if we just, like, resurrected as soon as we were killed,
                        so we could keep
                        fighting, and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nico, this is serious. Real swords. These can hurt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He stared at me, a little disappointed, and I realized that I’d just sounded
                        like my mother.
                        Whoa. Not a good sign. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I patted Nico on the shoulder. “Hey, it’s cool. Just follow the team. Stay out
                        of Zoë’s way.
                        We’ll have a blast.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron’s hoof thundered on the pavilion floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Heroes!” he called. “You know the rules! The creek is the boundary line. Blue
                        team—Camp
                        Half-Blood—shall take the west woods. Hunters of Artemis—red team—shall take the east woods. I
                        will serve as
                        referee and battlefield medic. No intentional maiming, please! All magic items are allowed. To
                        your positions!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sweet,” Nico whispered next to me. “What kind of magic items? Do I get one?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was about to break it to him that he didn’t, when Thalia said, “Blue team!
                        Follow me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They cheered and followed. I had to run to catch up, and tripped over
                        somebody’s shield, so I
                        didn’t look much like a co-captain. More like an idiot. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">We set our flag at the top of Zeus’s Fist. It’s this cluster of boulders in the
                        middle of the
                        west woods that, if you look at it just the right way, looks like a huge fist sticking out of
                        the ground. If you
                        look at it from any other side, it looks like a pile of enormous deer droppings, but Chiron
                        wouldn’t let us call
                        the place the Poop Pile, especially after it had been named for Zeus, who doesn’t have much of a
                        sense of humor.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Anyway, it was a good place to set the flag. The top boulder was twenty feet
                        tall and really
                        hard to climb, so the flag was clearly visible, like the rules said it had to be, and it didn’t
                        matter that the
                        guards weren’t allowed to stand within ten yards of it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I set Nico on guard duty with Beckendorf and the Stoll brothers, figuring he’d
                        be safely out of
                        the way. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll send out a decoy to the left,” Thalia told the team. “Silena, you lead
                        that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Got it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Take Laurel and Jason. They’re good runners. Make a wide arc around the
                        Hunters, attract as
                        many as you can. I’ll take the main raiding party around to the right and catch them by
                        surprise.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everybody nodded. It sounded good, and Thalia said it with such confidence you
                        couldn’t help
                        but believe it would work. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia looked at me. “Anything to add, Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, yeah. Keep sharp on defense. We’ve got four guards, two scouts. That’s not
                        much for a big
                        forest. I’ll be roving. Yell if you need help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And don’t leave your post!” Thalia said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Unless you see a golden opportunity,” I added. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia scowled. “Just don’t leave your post.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right, unless—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” She touched my arm and shocked me. I mean, everybody can give static
                        shocks in the
                        winter, but when Thalia does, it hurts. I guess it’s because her dad is the god of lightning.
                        She’s been known
                        to fry off people’s eyebrows. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/6-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry,” Thalia said, though she didn’t sound particularly sorry. “Now, is
                        everybody clear?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everybody nodded. We broke into our smaller groups. The horn sounded, and the
                        game began. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Silena’s group disappeared into the woods on the left. Thalia’s group gave it a
                        few seconds,
                        then darted off toward the right. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I waited for something to happen. I climbed Zeus’s Fist and had a good view
                        over the forest. I
                        remembered how the Hunters had stormed out of the woods when they fought the manticore, and I
                        was prepared for
                        something like that—one huge charge that could overwhelm us. But nothing happened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I caught a glimpse of Silena and her two scouts. They ran through a clearing,
                        followed by five
                        of the Hunters, leading them deep into the woods and away from Thalia. The plan seemed to be
                        working. Then I
                        spotted another clump of Hunters heading to the right, bows ready. They must’ve spotted Thalia.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What’s happening?” Nico demanded, trying to climb up next to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mind was racing. Thalia would never get through, but the Hunters were
                        divided. With that
                        many on either flank, their center had to be wide open. If I moved fast…</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at Beckendorf. “Can you guys hold the fort?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Beckendorf snorted. “Of course.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m going in.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Stoll brothers and Nico cheered as I raced toward the boundary line. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was running at top speed and I felt great. I leaped over the creek into enemy
                        territory. I
                        could see their silver flag up ahead, only one guard, who wasn’t even looking in my direction. I
                        heard fighting
                        to my left and right, somewhere in the woods. I had it made. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The guard turned at the last minute. It was Bianca di Angelo. Her eyes widened
                        as I slammed
                        into her and she went sprawling in the snow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry!” I yelled. I ripped down the silver silk flag from the tree and took
                        off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was ten yards away before Bianca managed to yell for help. I thought I was
                        home free. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">ZIP! </i>A silvery cord raced across my ankles and fastened
                        to the tree
                        next to me. A trip wire, fired from a bow! Before I could even think about stopping, I went down
                        hard, sprawling
                        in the snow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Thalia yelled, off to my left. “What are you <i
                            class="calibre5">doing</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before she reached me, an arrow exploded at her feet and a cloud of yellow
                        smoke billowed
                        around her team. They started coughing and gagging. I could smell the gas from across the
                        woods—the horrible
                        smell of sulfur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No fair!” Thalia gasped. “Fart arrows are unsportsmanlike!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I got up and started running again. Only a few more yards to the creek and I
                        had the game. More
                        arrows whizzed past my ears. A Hunter came out of nowhere and slashed at me with her knife, but
                        I parried and
                        kept running. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I heard yelling from our side of the creek. Beckendorf and Nico were running
                        toward me. I
                        thought they were coming to welcome me back, but then I saw they were chasing someone—Zoë
                        Nightshade, racing
                        toward me like a cheetah, dodging campers with no trouble. And she had our flag in her hands.

                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” I yelled, and poured on the speed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was two feet from the water when Zoë bolted across to her own side, slamming
                        into me for good
                        measure. The Hunters cheered as both sides converged on the creek. Chiron appeared out of the
                        woods, looking
                        grim. He had the Stoll brothers on his back, and it looked as if both of them had taken some
                        nasty whacks to the
                        head. Connor Stoll had two arrows sticking out of his helmet like antennae. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Hunters win!” Chiron announced without pleasure. Then he muttered, “For
                        the fifty-sixth
                        time in a row.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Perseus Jackson!” Thalia yelled, storming toward me. She smelled like rotten
                        eggs, and she was
                        so mad that blue sparks flickered on her armor. Everybody cringed and backed up because of
                        Aegis. It took all my
                        willpower not to cower. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What in the name of the gods were you THINKING?” she bellowed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I balled my fists. I’d had enough bad stuff happen to me for one day. I didn’t
                        need this. “I
                        got the flag, Thalia!” I shook it in her face. “I saw a chance and I took it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I WAS AT THEIR BASE!” Thalia yelled. “But the flag was gone. If you hadn’t
                        butted in, we
                        would’ve won.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You had too many on you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, so it’s my fault?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I didn’t say that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Argh!” Thalia pushed me, and a shock went through my body that blew me
                        backward ten feet into
                        the water. Some of the campers gasped. A couple of the Hunters stifled laughs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry!” Thalia said, turning pale. “I didn’t mean to—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Anger roared in my ears. A wave erupted from the creek, blasting into Thalia’s
                        face and dousing
                        her from head to toe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stood up. “Yeah,” I growled. “I didn’t mean to, either.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia was breathing heavily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Enough!” Chiron ordered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But Thalia held out her spear. “You want some, Seaweed Brain?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Somehow, it was okay when Annabeth called me that—at least, I’d gotten used to
                        it—but hearing
                        it from Thalia was not cool. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bring it on, Pinecone Face!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I raised Riptide, but before I could even defend myself, Thalia yelled, and a
                        blast of
                        lightning came down from the sky, hit her spear like a lightning rod, and slammed into my chest.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sat down hard. There was a burning smell; I had a feeling it was my clothes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thalia!” Chiron said. “That is <i class="calibre5">enough</i>!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I got to my feet and willed the entire creek to rise. It swirled up, hundreds
                        of gallons of
                        water in a massive icy funnel cloud. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Chiron pleaded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was about to hurl it at Thalia when I saw something in the woods. I lost my
                        anger and my
                        concentration all at once. The water splashed back into the creekbed. Thalia was so surprised
                        she turned to see
                        what I was looking at. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Someone…something was approaching. It was shrouded in a murky green mist, but
                        as it got closer,
                        the campers and Hunters gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This is impossible,” Chiron said. I’d never heard him sound so nervous.
                        “It…she has never left
                        the attic. Never.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And yet, the withered mummy that held the Oracle shuffled forward until she
                        stood in the center
                        of the group. Mist curled around our feet, turning the snow a sickly shade of green. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">None of us dared move. Then her voice hissed inside my head. Apparently
                        everyone could hear it,
                        because several clutched their hands over the ears. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">I am the spirit of Delphi, </i>the voice said. <i
                            class="calibre5">Speaker
                            of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo, slayer of the mighty Python</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Oracle regarded me with its cold, dead eyes. Then she turned unmistakably
                        toward Zoë
                        Nightshade. <i class="calibre5">Approach, Seeker, and ask. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë swallowed. “What must I do to help my goddess?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Oracle’s mouth opened, and green mist poured out. I saw the vague image of
                        a mountain, and
                        a girl standing at the barren peak. It was Artemis, but she was wrapped in chains, fettered to
                        the rocks. She
                        was kneeling, her hands raised as if to fend off an attacker, and it looked like she was in
                        pain. The Oracle
                        spoke: </p>
                    <blockquote class="calibre16">
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Five shall go west to the goddess in chains, </i></p>
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">One shall be lost in the land without rain, </i></p>
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">The bane of Olympus shows the trail, </i></p>
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Campers and Hunters combined prevail, </i></p>
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">The Titan’s curse must one withstand, </i></p>
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">And one shall perish by a parent’s hand. </i></p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Then, as we were watching, the mist swirled and retreated like a great green
                        serpent into the
                        mummy’s mouth. The Oracle sat down on a rock and became as still as she’d been in the attic, as
                        if she might sit
                        by this creek for a hundred years. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Instead, Grover and I were elected to carry her. I didn’t figure that was
                        because we were the
                        most popular. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Watch her head!” Grover warned as we went up the stairs. But it was too late.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Bonk! </i>I whacked her mummified face against the trapdoor
                        frame and dust
                        flew. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah, man.” I set her down and checked for damage. “Did I break anything?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I can’t tell,” Grover admitted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We hauled her up and set her on her tripod stool, both of us huffing and
                        sweating. Who knew a
                        mummy could weigh so much? </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">I assumed she wouldn’t talk to me, and I was right. I was relieved when we
                        finally got out of
                        there and slammed the attic door shut. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well,” Grover said, “that was gross.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I knew he was trying to keep things light for my sake, but I still felt really
                        down. The whole
                        camp would be mad at me for losing the game to the Hunters, and then there was the new prophecy
                        from the Oracle.
                        It was like the spirit of Delphi had gone out of her way to exclude me. She’d ignored my
                        question and walked
                        half a mile to talk to Zoë. <i class="calibre5">And </i>she’d said nothing, not even a hint,
                        about Annabeth.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What will Chiron do?” I asked Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I wish I knew.” He looked wistfully out the second-floor window at the rolling
                        hills covered
                        in snow. “I want to be out there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Searching for Annabeth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He had a little trouble focusing on me. Then he blushed. “Oh, right. That too.
                        Of course.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why?” I asked. “What were you thinking?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He clopped his hooves uneasily. “Just something the manticore said, about the
                        Great Stirring. I
                        can’t help but wonder…if all those ancient powers are waking up, maybe…maybe not all of them are
                        evil.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You mean Pan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I felt kind of selfish, because I’d totally forgotten about Grover’s life
                        ambition. The nature
                        god had gone missing two thousand years ago. He was rumored to have died, but the satyrs didn’t
                        believe that.
                        They were determined to find him. They’d been searching in vain for centuries, and Grover was
                        convinced he’d be
                        the one to succeed. This year, with Chiron putting all the satyrs on emergency duty to find
                        half-bloods, Grover
                        hadn’t been able to continue his search. It must’ve been driving him nuts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ve let the trail go cold,” he said. “I feel restless, like I’m missing
                        something really
                        important. He’s out there somewhere. I can just feel it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know what to say. I wanted to encourage him, but I didn’t know how. My
                        optimism had
                        pretty much been trampled into the snow out there in the woods, along with our capture-the-flag
                        hopes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before I could respond, Thalia tromped up the stairs. She was officially not
                        talking to me now,
                        but she looked at Grover and said, “Tell Percy to get his butt downstairs.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Did he say something?” Thalia asked Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, he asked why.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Dionysus is calling a council of cabin leaders to discuss the prophecy,” she
                        said.
                        “Unfortunately, that includes Percy.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The council was held around a Ping-Pong table in the rec room. Dionysus waved
                        his hand and
                        supplied snacks: Cheez Whiz, crackers, and several bottles of red wine. Then Chiron reminded him
                        that wine was
                        against his restrictions and most of us were underage. Mr. D sighed. With a snap of his fingers
                        the wine turned
                        to Diet Coke. Nobody drank that either. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D and Chiron (in wheelchair form) sat at one end of the table. Zoë and
                        Bianca di Angelo
                        (who had kind of become Zoë’s personal assistant) took the other end. Thalia and Grover and I
                        sat along the
                        right, and the other head councilors—Beckendorf, Silena Beauregard, and the Stoll brothers—sat
                        on the left. The
                        Ares kids were supposed to send a representative, too, but all of them had gotten broken limbs
                        (accidentally)
                        during capture the flag, courtesy of the Hunters. They were resting up in the infirmary. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë started the meeting off on a positive note. “This is pointless.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cheez Whiz!” Grover gasped. He began scooping up crackers and Ping-Pong balls
                        and spraying
                        them with topping. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There is no time for talk,” Zoë continued. “Our goddess needs us. The Hunters
                        must leave
                        immediately.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And go where?” Chiron asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“West!” Bianca said. I was amazed at how different she looked after just a few
                        days with the
                        Hunters. Her dark hair was braided like Zoë’s now, so you could actually see her face. She had a
                        splash of
                        freckles across her nose, and her dark eyes vaguely reminded me of someone famous, but I
                        couldn’t think who. She
                        looked like she’d been working out, and her skin glowed faintly, like the other Hunters, as if
                        she’d been taking
                        showers in liquid moonlight. “You heard the prophecy. <i class="calibre5">Five shall go west to
                            the goddess in
                            chains. </i>We can get five hunters and go.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/7-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes,” Zoë agreed. “Artemis is being held hostage! We must find her and free
                        her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re missing something, as usual,” Thalia said. “<i class="calibre5">Campers
                            and Hunters
                            combined prevail. </i>We’re supposed to do this together.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Zoë said. “The Hunters do not need thy help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“Your,” </i>Thalia grumbled. “Nobody has said <i
                            class="calibre5">thy
                        </i>in, like, three hundred years, Zoë. Get with the times.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë hesitated, like she was trying to form the word correctly. “<i
                            class="calibre5">Yerrr</i>.
                        We do not need <i class="calibre5">yerrr </i>help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia rolled her eyes. “Forget it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I fear the prophecy says you <i class="calibre5">do </i>need our help,” Chiron
                        said. “Campers
                        and Hunters must cooperate.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Or do they?” Mr. D mused, swirling his Diet Coke under his nose like it had a
                        fine bouquet.
                        “<i class="calibre5">One shall be lost. One shall perish. </i>That sounds rather nasty, doesn’t
                        it? What if you
                        fail <i class="calibre5">because </i>you try to cooperate?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mr. D,” Chiron sighed, “with all due respect, whose side are you on?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dionysus raised his eyebrows. “Sorry, my dear centaur. Just trying to be
                        helpful.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’re supposed to work together,” Thalia said stubbornly. “I don’t like it
                        either, Zoë, but
                        you know prophecies. You want to fight against one?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë grimaced, but I could tell Thalia had scored a point. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We must not delay,” Chiron warned. “Today is Sunday. This very Friday,
                        December twenty-first,
                        is the winter solstice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, joy,” Dionysus muttered. “Another dull annual meeting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Artemis must be present at the solstice,” Zoë said. “She has been one of the
                        most vocal on the
                        council arguing for action against Kronos’s minions. If she is absent, the gods will decide
                        nothing. We will
                        lose another year of war preparations.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Are you suggesting that the gods have trouble acting together, young lady?”
                        Dionysus asked.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, Lord Dionysus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D nodded. “Just checking. You’re right, of course. Carry on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I must agree with Zoë,” said Chiron. “Artemis’s presence at the winter council
                        is critical. We
                        have only a week to find her. And possibly even more important: to locate the monster she was
                        hunting. Now, we
                        must decide who goes on this quest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Three and two,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everybody looked at me. Thalia even forgot to ignore me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’re supposed to have five,” I said, feeling self-conscious. “Three Hunters,
                        two from Camp
                        Half-Blood. That’s more than fair.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia and Zoë exchanged looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well,” Thalia said. “It does make sense.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë grunted. “I would prefer to take <i class="calibre5">all </i>the Hunters.
                        We will need
                        strength of numbers.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’ll be retracing the goddess’s path,” Chiron reminded her. “Moving quickly.
                        No doubt
                        Artemis tracked the scent of this rare monster, whatever it is, as she moved west. You will have
                        to do the same.
                        The prophecy was clear: <i class="calibre5">The bane of Olympus shows the trail. </i>What would
                        your mistress
                        say? ‘Too many Hunters spoil the scent.’ A small group is best.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë picked up a Ping-Pong paddle and studied it like she was deciding who she
                        wanted to whack
                        first. “This monster—the bane of Olympus. I have hunted at Lady Artemis’s side for many years,
                        yet I have no
                        idea what this beast might be.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everybody looked at Dionysus, I guess because he was the only god present and
                        gods are supposed
                        to know things. He was flipping through a wine magazine, but when everyone got silent he glanced
                        up. “Well,
                        don’t look at me. I’m a <i class="calibre5">young </i>god, remember? I don’t keep track of all
                        those ancient
                        monsters and dusty titans. They make for terrible party conversation.” </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Chiron,” I said, “you don’t have any ideas about the monster?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron pursed his lips. “I have several ideas, none of them good. And none of
                        them quite make
                        sense. Typhon, for instance, could fit this description. He was truly a bane of Olympus. Or the
                        sea monster
                        Keto. But if either of these were stirring, we would know it. They are ocean monsters the size
                        of skyscrapers.
                        Your father, Poseidon, would already have sounded the alarm. I fear this monster may be more
                        elusive. Perhaps
                        even more powerful.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s some serious danger you’re facing,” Connor Stoll said. (I liked how he
                        said <i class="calibre5">you </i>and not <i class="calibre5">we</i>.) “It sounds like at least
                        two of the five are
                        going to die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“One shall be lost in the land without rain,”
                        </i>Beckendorf said. “If I
                        were you, I’d stay out of the desert.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a muttering of agreement. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And <i class="calibre5">the Titan’s curse must one withstand,</i>” Silena
                        said. “What could
                        that mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I saw Chiron and Zoë exchange a nervous look, but whatever they were thinking,
                        they didn’t
                        share it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“One shall perish by a parent’s hand,” </i>Grover said in
                        between bites of
                        Cheez Whiz and Ping-Pong balls. “How is that possible? Whose parent would kill them?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was heavy silence around the table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I glanced at Thalia and wondered if she was thinking the same thing I was.
                        Years ago, Chiron
                        had had a prophecy about the next child of the Big Three—Zeus, Poseidon, or Hades—who turned
                        sixteen.
                        Supposedly, that kid would make a decision that would save or destroy the gods forever. Because
                        of that, the Big
                        Three had taken an oath after World War II not to have any more kids. But Thalia and I had been
                        born anyway, and
                        now we were both getting close to sixteen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I remembered a conversation I’d had last year with Annabeth. I’d asked her, if
                        I was so
                        potentially dangerous, why the gods didn’t just kill me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Some of the gods would like to kill you</i>, she’d said. <i
                            class="calibre5">But they’re afraid of offending Poseidon. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Could an Olympian parent turn against his half-blood child? Would it sometimes
                        be easier just
                        to let them die? If there were ever any half-bloods who needed to worry about that, it was
                        Thalia and me. I
                        wondered if maybe I should’ve sent Poseidon that seashell pattern tie for Father’s Day after
                        all. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There will be deaths,” Chiron decided. “That much we know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, goody!” Dionysus said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everyone looked at him. He glanced up innocently from the pages of <i
                            class="calibre5">Wine
                            Connoisseur </i>magazine. “Ah, pinot noir is making a comeback. Don’t mind me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy is right,” Silena Beauregard said. “Two campers should go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, I see,” Zoë said sarcastically. “And I suppose you wish to volunteer?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Silena blushed. “I’m not going anywhere with the Hunters. Don’t look at me!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A daughter of Aphrodite does not wish to be looked at,” Zoë scoffed. “What
                        would thy mother
                        say?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Silena started to get out of her chair, but the Stoll brothers pulled her back.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stop it,” Beckendorf said. He was a big guy with a bigger voice. He didn’t
                        talk much, but when
                        he did, people tended to listen. “Let’s start with the Hunters. Which three of you will go?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë stood. “I shall go, of course, and I will take Phoebe. She is our best
                        tracker.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The big girl who likes to hit people on the head?” Travis Stoll asked
                        cautiously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The one who put the arrows in my helmet?” Connor added. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes,” Zoë snapped. “Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, nothing,” Travis said. “Just that we have a T-shirt for her from the camp
                        store.” He held
                        up a big silver T-shirt that said <small class="calibre4">ARTEMIS THE MOON GODDESS</small>,
                        <small class="calibre4">FALL HUNTING TOUR 2002</small>, with a huge list of national parks and
                        stuff underneath.
                        “It’s a collector’s item. She was admiring it. You want to give it to her?”
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/7-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I knew the Stolls were up to something. They always were. But I guess Zoë
                        didn’t know them as
                        well as I did. She just sighed and took the T-shirt. “As I was saying, I will take Phoebe. And I
                        wish Bianca to
                        go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca looked stunned. “Me? But…I’m so new. I wouldn’t be any good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You will do fine,” Zoë insisted. “There is no better way to prove thyself.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca closed her mouth. I felt kind of sorry for her. I remembered my first
                        quest when I was
                        twelve. I had felt totally unprepared. A little honored, maybe, but a lot resentful and plenty
                        scared. I figured
                        the same things were running around in Bianca’s head right now. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And for campers?” Chiron asked. His eyes met mine, but I couldn’t tell what he
                        was thinking.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Me!” Grover stood up so fast he bumped the Ping-Pong table. He brushed cracker
                        crumbs and
                        Ping-Pong ball scraps off his lap. “Anything to help Artemis!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë wrinkled her nose. “I think not, satyr. You are not even a half-blood.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But he <i class="calibre5">is </i>a camper,” Thalia said. “And he’s got a
                        satyr’s senses and
                        woodland magic. Can you play a tracker’s song yet, Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Absolutely!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë wavered. I didn’t know what a tracker’s song was, but apparently Zoë
                        thought it was a good
                        thing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Very well,” Zoë said. “And the second camper?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll go.” Thalia stood and looked around, daring anyone to question her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Now, okay, maybe my math skills weren’t the best, but it suddenly occurred to
                        me that we’d
                        reached the number five, and I wasn’t in the group. “Whoa, wait a sec,” I said. “I want to go
                        too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia said nothing. Chiron was still studying me, his eyes sad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh,” Grover said, suddenly aware of the problem. “Whoa, yeah, I forgot! Percy
                        has to go. I
                        didn’t mean…I’ll stay. Percy should go in my place.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He cannot,” Zoë said. “He is a boy. I won’t have Hunters traveling with a
                        boy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You traveled here with me,” I reminded her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That was a short-term emergency, and it was ordered by the goddess. I will not
                        go across
                        country and fight many dangers in the company of a boy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What about Grover?” I demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë shook her head. “He does not count. He’s a satyr. He is not technically a
                        boy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” Grover protested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I <i class="calibre5">have </i>to go,” I said. “I need to be on this quest.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why?” Zoë asked. “Because of thy friend Annabeth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I felt myself blushing. I hated that everyone was looking at me. “No! I mean,
                        partly. I just
                        feel like I’m supposed to go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nobody rose to my defense. Mr. D looked bored, still reading his magazine.
                        Silena, the Stoll
                        brothers, and Beckendorf were staring at the table. Bianca gave me a look of pity. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” Zoë said flatly. “I insist upon this. I will take a satyr if I must, but
                        not a male
                        hero.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron sighed. “The quest is for Artemis. The Hunters should be allowed to
                        approve their
                        companions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My ears were ringing as I sat down. I knew Grover and some of the others were
                        looking at me
                        sympathetically, but I couldn’t meet their eyes. I just sat there as Chiron concluded the
                        council. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“So be it,” he said. “Thalia and Grover will accompany Zoë, Bianca, and Phoebe.
                        You shall leave
                        at first light. And may the gods”—he glanced at Dionysus—“present company included, we hope—be
                        with you.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I didn’t show up for dinner that night, which was a mistake, because Chiron and
                        Grover came
                        looking for me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, I’m so sorry!” Grover said, sitting next to me on the bunk. “I didn’t
                        know they’d—that
                        you’d—Honest!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He started to sniffle, and I figured if I didn’t cheer him up he’d either start
                        bawling or
                        chewing up my mattress. He tends to eat household objects whenever he gets upset. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s okay,” I lied. “Really. It’s fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover’s lower lip trembled. “I wasn’t even thinking…I was so focused on
                        helping Artemis. But I
                        promise, I’ll look everywhere for Annabeth. If I can find her, I will.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I nodded and tried to ignore the big crater that was opening in my chest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grover,” Chiron said, “perhaps you’d let me have a word with Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sure,” he sniffled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron waited. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh,” Grover said. “You mean alone. Sure, Chiron.” He looked at me miserably.
                        “See? Nobody
                        needs a goat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He trotted out the door, blowing his nose on his sleeve. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron sighed and knelt on his horse legs. “Percy, I don’t pretend to
                        understand prophecies.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I said. “Well, maybe that’s because they don’t make any sense.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron gazed at the saltwater spring gurgling in the corner of the room.
                        “Thalia would not have
                        been my first choice to go on this quest. She’s too impetuous. She acts without thinking. She is
                        too sure of
                        herself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Would you have chosen me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Frankly, no,” he said. “You and Thalia are much alike.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thanks a lot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He smiled. “The difference is that you are less sure of yourself than Thalia.
                        That could be
                        good or bad. But one thing I can say: both of you together would be a dangerous thing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We could handle it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The way you handled it at the creek tonight?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t answer. He’d nailed me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Perhaps it is for the best,” Chiron mused. “You can go home to your mother for
                        the holidays.
                        If we need you, we can call.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I said. “Maybe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I pulled Riptide out of my pocket and set it on my nightstand. It didn’t seem
                        that I’d be using
                        it for anything but writing Christmas cards. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When he saw the pen, Chiron grimaced. “It’s no wonder Zoë doesn’t want you
                        along, I suppose.
                        Not while you’re carrying that particular weapon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t understand what he meant. Then I remembered something he’d told me a
                        long time ago,
                        when he first gave me the magic sword: <i class="calibre5">It has a long and tragic history,
                            which we need not
                            go into. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to ask him about that, but then he pulled a golden drachma from his
                        saddlebag and
                        tossed it to me. “Call your mother, Percy. Let her know you’re coming home in the morning. And,
                        ah, for what
                        it’s worth…I almost volunteered for this quest myself. I would have gone, if not for the last
                        line.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">One shall perish by a parent’s hand. </i>Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t need to ask. I knew Chiron’s dad was Kronos, the evil Titan Lord
                        himself. The line
                        would make perfect sense if Chiron went on the quest. Kronos didn’t care for anyone, including
                        his own children.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Chiron,” I said. “You know what this Titan’s curse is, don’t you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His face darkened. He made a claw over his heart and pushed outward—an ancient
                        gesture for
                        warding off evil. “Let us hope the prophecy does not mean what I think. Now, good night, Percy.
                        And your time
                        will come. I’m convinced of that. There’s no need to rush.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/7-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">He said <i class="calibre5">your time </i>the way people did when they meant <i
                            class="calibre5">your death</i>. I didn’t know if Chiron meant it that way, but the look in
                        his eyes made me
                        scared to ask. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I stood at the saltwater spring, rubbing Chiron’s coin in my hand and trying to
                        figure out what
                        to say to my mom. I really wasn’t in the mood to have one more adult tell me that doing nothing
                        was the greatest
                        thing I could do, but I figured my mom deserved an update. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally, I took a deep breath and threw in the coin. “O goddess, accept my
                        offering.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The mist shimmered. The light from the bathroom was just enough to make a faint
                        rainbow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Show me Sally Jackson,” I said. “Upper East Side, Manhattan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And there in the mist was a scene I did not expect. My mom was sitting at our
                        kitchen table
                        with some…guy. They were laughing hysterically. There was a big stack of textbooks between them.
                        The man was, I
                        don’t know, thirtysomething, with longish salt-and-pepper hair and a brown jacket over a black
                        T-shirt. He
                        looked like an actor—like a guy who might play an undercover cop on television. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was too stunned to say anything, and fortunately, my mom and the guy were too
                        busy laughing
                        to notice my Iris-message. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The guy said, “Sally, you’re a riot. You want some more wine?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah, I shouldn’t. You go ahead if you want.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Actually, I’d better use your bathroom. May I?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Down the hall,” she said, trying not to laugh. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The actor dude smiled and got up and left. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mom!” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She jumped so hard she almost knocked her textbooks off the table. Finally she
                        focused on me.
                        “Percy! Oh, honey! Is everything okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What are you doing?” I demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She blinked. “Homework.” Then she seemed to understand the look on my face.
                        “Oh, honey, that’s
                        just Paul—um, Mr. Blofis. He’s in my writing seminar.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mr. Blowfish?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">Blofis</i>. He’ll be back in a minute, Percy. Tell me
                        what’s wrong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She always knew when something was wrong. I told her about Annabeth. The other
                        stuff too, but
                        mostly it boiled down to Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mother’s eyes teared up. I could tell she was trying hard to keep it
                        together for my sake.
                        “Oh, Percy…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah. So they tell me there’s nothing I can do. I guess I’ll be coming home.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She turned her pencil around in her fingers. “Percy, as much as I want you to
                        come home”—she
                        sighed like she was mad at herself—“as much as I want you to be safe, I want you to understand
                        something. You
                        need to do whatever you think you have to.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/7-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at her. “What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I mean, do you really, deep down, believe that you have to help save her? Do
                        you think it’s
                        the right thing to do? Because I know one thing about you, Percy. Your heart is always in the
                        right place.
                        Listen to it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re…you’re telling me to go?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mother pursed her lips. “I’m telling you that…you’re getting too old for me
                        to tell you what
                        to do. I’m telling you that I’ll support you, even if what you decide to do is dangerous. I
                        can’t believe I’m
                        saying this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mom—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The toilet flushed down the hall in our apartment. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t have much time,” my mom said. “Percy, whatever you decide, I love you.
                        And I <i class="calibre5">know </i>you’ll do what’s best for Annabeth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How can you be sure?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Because she’d do the same for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And with that, my mother waved her hand over the mist, and the connection
                        dissolved, leaving me
                        with one final image of her new friend, Mr. Blowfish, smiling down at her. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">I don’t remember falling asleep, but I remember the dream. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was back in that barren cave, the ceiling heavy and low above me. Annabeth
                        was kneeling under
                        the weight of a dark mass that looked like a pile of boulders. She was too tired even to cry
                        out. Her legs
                        trembled. Any second, I knew she would run out of strength and the cavern ceiling would collapse
                        on top of her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How is our mortal guest?” a male voice boomed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It wasn’t Kronos. Kronos’s voice was raspy and metallic, like a knife scraped
                        across stone. I’d
                        heard it taunting me many times before in my dreams. But <i class="calibre5">this </i>voice was
                        deeper and
                        lower, like a bass guitar. Its force made the ground vibrate. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke emerged from the shadows. He ran to Annabeth, knelt beside her, then
                        looked back at the
                        unseen man. “She’s fading. We must hurry.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The hypocrite. Like he really cared what happened to her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The deep voice chuckled. It belonged to someone in the shadows, at the edge of
                        my dream. Then a
                        meaty hand thrust someone forward into the light—Artemis—her hands and feet bound in celestial
                        bronze chains.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I gasped. Her silvery dress was torn and tattered. Her face and arms were cut
                        in several
                        places, and she was bleeding ichor, the golden blood of the gods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You heard the boy,” said the man in the shadows. “Decide!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis’s eyes flashed with anger. I didn’t know why she just didn’t will the
                        chains to burst,
                        or make herself disappear, but she didn’t seem able to. Maybe the chains prevented her, or some
                        magic about this
                        dark, horrible place. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The goddess looked at Annabeth and her expression changed to concern and
                        outrage. “How dare you
                        torture a maiden like this!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“She will die soon,” Luke said. “You can save her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth made a weak sound of protest. My heart felt like it was being twisted
                        into a knot. I
                        wanted to run to her, but I couldn’t move. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Free my hands,” Artemis said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke brought out his sword, Backbiter. With one expert strike, he broke the
                        goddess’s
                        handcuffs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis ran to Annabeth and took the burden from her shoulders. Annabeth
                        collapsed on the
                        ground and lay there shivering. Artemis staggered, trying to support the weight of the black
                        rocks. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The man in the shadows chuckled. “You are as predictable as you were easy to
                        beat, Artemis.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You surprised me,” the goddess said, straining under her burden. “It will not
                        happen again.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Indeed it will not,” the man said. “Now you are out of the way for good! I
                        knew you could not
                        resist helping a young maiden. That is, after all, your specialty, my dear.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis groaned. “You know nothing of mercy, you swine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“On that,” the man said, “we can agree. Luke, you may kill the girl now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Artemis shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke hesitated. “She—she may yet be useful, sir. Further bait.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bah! You truly believe that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, General. They will come for her. I’m sure.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The man considered. “Then the dracaenae can guard her here. Assuming she does
                        not die from her
                        injuries, you may keep her alive until winter solstice. After that, if our sacrifice goes as
                        planned, her life
                        will be meaningless. The lives of <i class="calibre5">all </i>mortals will be meaningless.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke gathered up Annabeth’s listless body and carried her away from the
                        goddess. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You will never find the monster you seek,” Artemis said. “Your plan will
                        fail.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How little you know, my young goddess,” the man in the shadows said. “Even
                        now, your darling
                        attendants begin their quest to find you. They shall play directly into my hands. Now, if you’ll
                        excuse us, we
                        have a long journey to make. We must greet your Hunters and make sure their quest
                        is…challenging.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The man’s laughter echoed in the darkness, shaking the ground until it seemed
                        the whole cavern
                        ceiling would collapse. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I woke with a start. I was sure I’d heard a loud banging. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked around the cabin. It was dark outside. The salt spring still gurgled.
                        No other sounds
                        but the hoot of an owl in the woods and the distant surf on the beach. In the moonlight, on my
                        nightstand, was
                        Annabeth’s New York Yankees cap. I stared at it for a second, and then: <i
                            class="calibre5">BANG. BANG. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Someone, or something, was pounding on my door. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I grabbed Riptide and got out of bed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hello?” I called. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">THUMP. THUMP. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I crept to the door. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I uncapped the blade, flung open the door, and found myself face-to-face with a
                        black pegasus.

                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Whoa, boss! </i>Its voice spoke in my mind as it clopped
                        away from the
                        sword blade. <i class="calibre5">I don’t wanna be a horse-ke-bob! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Its black wings spread in alarm, and the wind buffeted me back a step. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Blackjack,” I said, relieved but a little irritated. “It’s the middle of the
                        night!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Blackjack huffed. <i class="calibre5">Ain’t either, boss. It’s five in the
                            morning. What you
                            still sleeping for? </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How many times have I told you? Don’t call me boss.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Whatever you say, boss. You’re the man. You’re my number
                            one. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and tried not to let the pegasus read my
                        thoughts. That’s the
                        problem with being Poseidon’s son: since he created horses out of sea foam, I can understand
                        most equestrian
                        animals, but they can understand me, too. Sometimes, like in Blackjack’s case, they kind of
                        adopt me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">See, Blackjack had been a captive on board Luke’s ship last summer, until we’d
                        caused a little
                        distraction that allowed him to escape. I’d really had very little to do with it, seriously, but
                        Blackjack
                        credited me with saving him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Blackjack,” I said, “you’re supposed to stay in the stables.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i>Meh, the stables. You see Chiron staying in the stables?</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well…no.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i>Exactly. Listen, we got another little sea friend needs your help.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Again?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i>Yeah. I told the hippocampi I’d come get you.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I groaned. Anytime I was anywhere near the beach, the hippocampi would ask me
                        to help them with
                        their problems. And they had a lot of problems. Beached whales, porpoises caught in fishing
                        nets, mermaids with
                        hangnails—they’d call me to come underwater and help. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right,” I said. “I’m coming.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i>You’re the best, boss.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And don’t call me boss!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Blackjack whinnied softly. It might’ve been a laugh. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked back at my comfortable bed. My bronze shield still hung on the wall,
                        dented and
                        unusable. And on my nightstand was Annabeth’s magic Yankees cap. On an impulse, I stuck the cap
                        in my pocket. I
                        guess I had a feeling, even then, that I wasn’t coming back to my cabin for a long, long time.

                        on a flying
                        horse, skimming over the waves at a hundred miles an hour with the wind in my hair and the sea
                        spray in my
                        face—hey, it beats waterskiing any day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Here. </i>Blackjack slowed and turned in a circle. <i
                            class="calibre5">Straight down. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thanks.” I tumbled off his back and plunged into the icy sea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I’d gotten more comfortable doing stunts like that the past couple of years. I
                        could pretty
                        much move however I wanted to underwater, just by willing the ocean currents to change around me
                        and propel me
                        along. I could breathe underwater, no problem, and my clothes never got wet unless I wanted them
                        to. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I shot down into the darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Twenty, thirty, forty feet. The pressure wasn’t uncomfortable. I’d never tried
                        to push it—to
                        see if there was a limit to how deep I could dive. I knew most regular humans couldn’t go past
                        two hundred feet
                        without crumpling like an aluminum can. I should’ve been blind, too, this deep in the water at
                        night, but I
                        could see the heat from living forms, and the cold of the currents. It’s hard to describe. It
                        wasn’t like
                        regular seeing, but I could tell where everything was. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">As I got closer to the bottom, I saw three hippocampi—fish-tailed
                        horses—swimming in a circle
                        around an overturned boat. The hippocampi were beautiful to watch. Their fish tails shimmered in
                        rainbow colors,
                        glowing phosphorescent. Their manes were white, and they were galloping through the water the
                        way nervous horses
                        do in a thunderstorm. Something was upsetting them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I got closer and saw the problem. A dark shape—some kind of animal—was wedged
                        halfway under the
                        boat and tangled in a fishing net, one of those big nets they use on trawlers to catch
                        everything at once. I
                        hated those things. It was bad enough they drowned porpoises and dolphins, but they also
                        occasionally caught
                        mythological animals. When the nets got tangled, some lazy fishermen would just cut them loose
                        and let the
                        trapped animals die. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apparently this poor creature had been mucking around on the bottom of Long
                        Island Sound and
                        had somehow gotten itself tangled in the net of this sunken fishing boat. It had tried to get
                        out and managed to
                        get even more hopelessly stuck, shifting the boat in the process. Now the wreckage of the hull,
                        which was
                        resting against a big rock, was teetering and threatening to collapse on top of the tangled
                        animal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The hippocampi were swimming around frantically, wanting to help but not sure
                        how. One was
                        trying to chew the net, but hippocampi teeth just aren’t meant for cutting rope. Hippocampi are
                        really strong,
                        but they don’t have hands, and they’re not (shhh) all that smart. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Free it, lord! </i>A hippocampus said when it saw me. The
                        others joined in,
                        asking the same thing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I swam in for a closer look at the tangled creature. At first I thought it was
                        a young
                        hippocampus. I’d rescued several of them before. But then I heard a strange sound, something
                        that did not belong
                        underwater: </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mooooooo!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I got next to the thing and saw that it was a cow. I mean…I’d heard of sea
                        cows, like manatees
                        and stuff, but this really was a cow with the back end of a serpent. The front half was a calf—a
                        baby, with
                        black fur and big, sad brown eyes and a white muzzle—and its back half was a black-and-brown
                        snaky tail with
                        fins running down the top and bottom, like an enormous eel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whoa, little one,” I said. “Where did you come from?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The creature looked at me sadly. “Moooo!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But I couldn’t understand its thoughts. I only speak horse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">We don’t know what it is, lord</i>, one of the hippocampi
                        said. <i class="calibre5">Many strange things are stirring. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I murmured. “So I’ve heard.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I uncapped Riptide, and the sword grew to full length in my hands, its bronze
                        blade gleaming in
                        the dark. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The cow serpent freaked out and started struggling against the net, its eyes
                        full of terror.
                        “Whoa!” I said. “I’m not going to hurt you! Just let me cut the net.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/8-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">But the cow serpent thrashed around and got even more tangled. The boat started
                        to tilt,
                        stirring up the muck on the sea bottom and threatening to topple onto the cow serpent. The
                        hippocampi whinnied
                        in a panic and thrashed in the water, which didn’t help. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Okay, okay!” I said. I put away the sword and started speaking as calmly as I
                        could so the
                        hippocampi and the cow serpent would stop panicking. I didn’t know if it was possible to get
                        stampeded
                        underwater, but I didn’t really want to find out. “It’s cool. No sword. See? No sword. Calm
                        thoughts. Sea grass.
                        Mama cows. Vegetarianism.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I doubted the cow serpent understood what I was saying, but it responded to the
                        tone of my
                        voice. The hippocampi were still skittish, but they stopped swirling around me quite so fast.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Free it, lord! </i>they pleaded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I said. “I got that part. I’m thinking.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But how could I free the cow serpent when she (I decided it was probably a
                        “she”) panicked at
                        the sight of a blade? It was like she’d seen swords before and knew how dangerous they were.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right,” I told the hippocampi. “I need all of you to push exactly the way
                        I tell you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">First we started with the boat. It wasn’t easy, but with the strength of three
                        horsepower, we
                        managed to shift the wreckage so it was no longer threatening to collapse on the baby cow
                        serpent. Then I went
                        to work on the net, untangling it section by section, getting lead weights and fishing hooks
                        straightened out,
                        yanking out knots around the cow serpent’s hooves. It took forever—I mean, it was worse than the
                        time I’d had to
                        untangle all my video game controller wires. The whole time, I kept talking to the cow fish,
                        telling her
                        everything was okay while she mooed and moaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s okay, Bessie,” I said. Don’t ask me why I started calling her that. It
                        just seemed like a
                        good cow name. “Good cow. Nice cow.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally, the net came off and the cow serpent zipped through the water and did
                        a happy
                        somersault. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The hippocampi whinnied with joy. <i class="calibre5">Thank you, lord! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Moooo!” The cow serpent nuzzled me and gave me the big brown eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I said. “That’s okay. Nice cow. Well…stay out of trouble.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Which reminded me, I’d been underwater how long? An hour, at least. I had to
                        get back to my
                        cabin before Argus or the harpies discovered I was breaking curfew. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I shot to the surface and broke through. Immediately, Blackjack zoomed down and
                        let me catch
                        hold of his neck. He lifted me into the air and took me back toward the shore. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Success, boss?</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah. We rescued a baby…something or other. Took forever. Almost got
                        stampeded.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Good deeds are always dangerous, boss. You saved my sorry
                            mane, didn’t
                            you?</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t help thinking about my dream, with Annabeth crumpled and lifeless in
                        Luke’s arms.
                        Here I was rescuing baby monsters, but I couldn’t save my friend. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As Blackjack flew back toward my cabin, I happened to glance at the dining
                        pavilion. I saw a
                        figure—a boy hunkered down behind a Greek column, like he was hiding from someone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was Nico, but it wasn’t even dawn yet. Nowhere near time for breakfast. What
                        was he doing up
                        there? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hesitated. The last thing I wanted was more time for Nico to tell me about
                        his Mythomagic
                        game. But something was wrong. I could tell by the way he was crouching. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Blackjack,” I said, “set me down over there, will you? Behind that column.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I almost blew it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was coming up the steps behind Nico. He didn’t see me at all. He was behind a
                        column, peeking
                        around the corner, all his attention focused on the dining area. I was five feet away from him,
                        and I was about
                        to say <i class="calibre5">What are you doing? </i>real loud, when it occurred to me that he was
                        pulling a
                        Grover: he was spying on the Hunters. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There were voices—two girls talking at one of the dining tables. At this
                        ungodly hour of the
                        morning? Well, unless you’re the goddess of dawn, I guess. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I took Annabeth’s magic cap out of my pocket and put it on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t feel any different, but when I raised my arms I couldn’t see them. I
                        was invisible.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I crept up to Nico and sneaked around him. I couldn’t see the girls very well
                        in the dark, but
                        I knew their voices: Zoë and Bianca. It sounded like they were arguing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It <i class="calibre5">cannot </i>be cured,” Zoë was saying. “Not quickly, at
                        any rate.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But how did it happen?” Bianca asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A foolish prank,” Zoë growled. “Those Stoll boys from the Hermes cabin.
                        Centaur blood is like
                        acid. Everyone knows that. They sprayed the inside of that Artemis Hunting Tour T-shirt with
                        it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s terrible!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“She will live,” Zoë said. “But she’ll be bedridden for weeks with horrible
                        hives. There is no
                        way she can go. It’s up to me…and thee.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But the prophecy,” Bianca said. “If Phoebe can’t go, we only have four. We’ll
                        have to pick
                        another.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There is no time,” Zoë said. “We must leave at first light. That’s
                        immediately. Besides, the
                        prophecy said we would lose one.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“In the land without rain,” Bianca said, “but that can’t be here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It might be,” Zoë said, though she didn’t sound convinced. “The camp has magic
                        borders.
                        Nothing, not even weather, is allowed in without permission. It <i class="calibre5">could </i>be
                        a land without

                    <p class="calibre13">“But—” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Bianca, hear me.” Zoë’s voice was strained. “I…I can’t explain, but I have a
                        sense that we
                        should <i class="calibre5">not </i>pick someone else. It would be too dangerous. They would meet
                        an end worse
                        than Phoebe’s. I don’t want Chiron choosing a camper as our fifth companion. And…I don’t want to
                        risk another
                        Hunter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca was silent. “You should tell Thalia the rest of your dream.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No. It would not help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But if your suspicions are correct, about the General—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I have thy word not to talk about that,” Zoë said. She sounded really
                        anguished. “We will find
                        out soon enough. Now come. Dawn is breaking.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico scooted out of their way. He was faster than me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As the girls sprinted down the steps, Zoë almost ran into me. She froze, her
                        eyes narrowing.
                        Her hand crept toward her bow, but then Bianca said, “The lights of the Big House are on.
                        Hurry!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And Zoë followed her out of the pavilion. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I could tell what Nico was thinking. He took a deep breath and was about to run
                        after his
                        sister when I took off the invisibility cap and said, “Wait.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He almost slipped on the icy steps as he spun around to find me. “Where did you
                        come from?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ve been here the whole time. Invisible.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He mouthed the word <i class="calibre5">invisible</i>. “Wow. Cool.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How did you know Zoë and your sister were here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He blushed. “I heard them walk by the Hermes cabin. I don’t…I don’t sleep too
                        well at camp. So
                        I heard footsteps, and them whispering. And so I kind of followed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And now you’re thinking about following them on the quest,” I guessed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How did you know that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Because if it was my sister, I’d probably be thinking the same thing. But you
                        can’t.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked defiant. “Because I’m too young?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Because they won’t let you. They’ll catch you and send you back here.
                        And…yeah, because you’re
                        too young. You remember the manticore? There will be lots more like that. More dangerous. Some
                        of the heroes
                        will die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His shoulders sagged. He shifted from foot to foot. “Maybe you’re right. But,
                        but <i class="calibre5">you </i>can go for me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Say what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You can turn invisible. You can go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Hunters don’t like boys,” I reminded him. “If they find out—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t let them find out. Follow them invisibly. Keep an eye on my sister! You
                        have to.
                        Please?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nico—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re planning to go anyway, aren’t you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to say no. But he looked me in the eyes, and I somehow couldn’t lie to
                        him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I said. “I have to find Annabeth. I have to help, even if they don’t
                        want me to.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I won’t tell on you,” he said. “But you have to promise to keep my sister
                        safe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I…that’s a big thing to promise, Nico, on a trip like this. Besides, she’s got
                        Zoë, Grover,
                        and Thalia—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Promise,” he insisted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll do my best. I promise that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get going, then!” he said. “Good luck!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was crazy. I wasn’t packed. I had nothing but the cap and the sword and the
                        clothes I was
                        wearing. I was supposed to be going home to Manhattan this morning. “Tell Chiron—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll make something up.” Nico smiled crookedly. “I’m good at that. Go on!”
                    </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">I ran, putting on Annabeth’s cap. As the sun came up, I turned invisible. I hit
                        the top of
                        Half-Blood Hill in time to see the camp’s van disappearing down the farm road, probably Argus
                        taking the quest
                        group into the city. After that they would be on their own. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I felt a twinge of guilt, and stupidity, too. How was I supposed to keep up
                        with them. Run?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I heard the beating of huge wings. Blackjack landed next to me. He began
                        casually nuzzling
                        a few tufts of grass that stuck through the ice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">If I was guessing, boss, I’d say you need a getaway horse.

                    <p class="calibre13">A lump of gratitude stuck in my throat, but I managed to say, “Yeah. Let’s
                        fly.” </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">The thing about flying on a pegasus during the daytime is that if you’re not
                        careful, you can
                        cause a serious traffic accident on the Long Island Expressway. I had to keep Blackjack up in
                        the clouds, which
                        were, fortunately, pretty low in the winter. We darted around, trying to keep the white Camp
                        Half-Blood van in
                        sight. And if it was cold on the ground, it was seriously cold in the air, with icy rain
                        stinging my skin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was wishing I’d brought some of that Camp Half-Blood orange thermal underwear
                        they sold in
                        the camp store, but after the story about Phoebe and the centaur-blood T-shirt, I wasn’t sure I
                        trusted their
                        products anymore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We lost the van twice, but I had a pretty good sense that they would go into
                        Manhattan first,
                        so it wasn’t too difficult to pick up their trail again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Traffic was bad with the holidays and all. It was mid morning before they got
                        into the city. I
                        landed Blackjack near the top of the Chrysler Building and watched the white camp van, thinking
                        it would pull
                        into the bus station, but it just kept driving. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Where’s Argus taking them?” I muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Oh, Argus ain’t driving, boss, </i>Blackjack told me. <i
                            class="calibre5">That girl is. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Which girl?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">The Hunter girl. With the silver crown thing in her
                            hair.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zoë?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">That’s the one. Hey, look! There’s a donut shop. Can we get
                            something to
                            go?</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried explaining to Blackjack that taking a flying horse to a donut shop
                        would give every cop
                        in there a heart attack, but he didn’t seem to get it. Meanwhile, the van kept snaking its way
                        toward the
                        Lincoln Tunnel. It had never even occurred to me that Zoë could drive. I mean, she didn’t look
                        sixteen. Then
                        again, she was immortal. I wondered if she had a New York license, and if so, what her birth
                        date said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well,” I said. “Let’s get after them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were about to leap off the Chrysler Building when Blackjack whinnied in
                        alarm and almost
                        threw me. Something was curling around my leg like a snake. I reached for my sword, but when I
                        looked down,
                        there was no snake. Vines—grape vines—had sprouted from the cracks between the stones of the
                        building. They were
                        wrapping around Blackjack’s legs, lashing down my ankles so we couldn’t move. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Going somewhere?” Mr. D asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He was leaning against the building with his feet levitating in the air, his
                        leopard-skin
                        warm-up suit and black hair whipping around in the wind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">God alert! </i>Blackjack yelled. <i class="calibre5">It’s
                            the wine dude!
                        </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D sighed in exasperation. “The next person, <i class="calibre5">or
                            horse</i>, who calls me
                        the ‘wine dude’ will end up in a bottle of Merlot!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mr. D.” I tried to keep my voice calm as the grape vines continued to wrap
                        around my legs.
                        “What do you want?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, what do <i class="calibre5">I </i>want? You thought, perhaps, that the
                        immortal,
                        all-powerful director of camp would not notice you leaving without permission?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well…maybe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I should throw you off this building, minus the flying horse, and see how
                        heroic you sound on
                        the way down.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I balled my fists. I knew I should keep my mouth shut, but Mr. D was about to
                        kill me or haul
                        me back to camp in shame, and I couldn’t stand either idea. “Why do you hate me so much? What
                        did I ever do to
                        you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Purple flames flickered in his eyes. “You’re a hero, boy. I need no other
                        reason.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“I <i class="calibre5">have </i>to go on this quest! I’ve got to help my
                        friends. That’s
                        something you wouldn’t understand!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Um, boss, </i>Blackjack said nervously. <i
                            class="calibre5">Seeing as how
                            we’re wrapped in vines nine hundred feet in the air, you might want to talk nice. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The grape vines coiled tighter around me. Below us, the white van was getting
                        farther and
                        farther away. Soon it would be out of sight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Did I ever tell you about Ariadne?” Mr. D asked. “Beautiful young princess of
                        Crete? She liked
                        helping her friends, too. In fact, she helped a young hero named Theseus, also a son of
                        Poseidon. She gave him a
                        ball of magical yarn that let him find his way out of the Labyrinth. And do you know how Theseus
                        rewarded her?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The answer I wanted to give was <i class="calibre5">I don’t care! </i>But I
                        didn’t figure that
                        would make Mr. D finish his story any faster. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They got married,” I said. “Happily ever after. The end.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D sneered. “Not quite. Theseus <i class="calibre5">said </i>he would marry
                        her. He took her
                        aboard his ship and sailed for Athens. Halfway back, on a little island called Naxos, he…What’s
                        the word you
                        mortals use today?…he <i class="calibre5">dumped </i>her. I found her there, you know. Alone.
                        Heartbroken.
                        Crying her eyes out. She had given up everything, left everything she knew behind, to help a
                        dashing young hero
                        who tossed her away like a broken sandal.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s wrong,” I said. “But that was thousands of years ago. What’s that got
                        to do with me?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D regarded me coldly. “I fell in love with Ariadne, boy. I healed her
                        broken heart. And
                        when she died, I made her my immortal wife in Olympus. She waits for me even now. I shall go
                        back to her when I
                        am done with this infernal century of punishment at your ridiculous camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at him. “You’re…you’re married? But I thought you got in trouble for
                        chasing a wood
                        nymph—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“My <i class="calibre5">point </i>is you heroes never change. You accuse us
                        gods of being vain.
                        You should look at yourselves. You take what you want, use whoever you have to, and then you
                        betray everyone
                        around you. So you’ll excuse me if I have no love for heroes. They are a selfish, ungrateful
                        lot. Ask Ariadne.
                        Or Medea. For that matter, ask Zoë Nightshade.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean, ask Zoë?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He waved his hand dismissively. “Go. Follow your silly friends.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The vines uncurled around my legs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I blinked in disbelief. “You’re…you’re letting me go? Just like that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The prophecy says at least two of you will die. Perhaps I’ll get lucky and
                        you’ll be one of
                        them. But mark my words, Son of Poseidon, live or die, you will prove no better than the other
                        heroes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">With that, Dionysus snapped his fingers. His image folded up like a paper
                        display. There was a
                        <i class="calibre5">pop </i>and he was gone, leaving a faint scent of grapes that was quickly
                        blown away by the
                        wind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Too close, </i>Blackjack said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I nodded, though I almost would have been less worried if Mr. D had hauled me
                        back to camp. The
                        fact that he’d let me go meant he really believed we stood a fair chance of crashing and burning
                        on this quest.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on, Blackjack,” I said, trying to sound upbeat. “I’ll buy you some donuts
                        in New Jersey.”

                    <p class="calibre13">“Stay here,” I told him. “I’m going to scout.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">‘Stay here’ I can handle. I can do that. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I put on my cap of invisibility and walked over to the convenience store. It
                        was difficult not
                        to sneak. I had to keep reminding myself that nobody could see me. It was hard, too, because I
                        had to remember
                        to get out of people’s way so they wouldn’t slam into me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought I’d go inside and warm up, maybe get a cup of hot chocolate or
                        something. I had a
                        little change in my pocket. I could leave it on the counter. I was wondering if the cup would
                        turn invisible
                        when I picked it up, or if I’d have to deal with a floating hot chocolate problem, when my whole
                        plan was ruined
                        by Zoë, Thalia, Bianca, and Grover all coming out of the store. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grover, are you sure?” Thalia was saying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well…pretty sure. Ninety-nine percent. Okay, eighty-five percent.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And you did this with acorns?” Bianca asked, like she couldn’t believe it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked offended. “It’s a time-honored tracking spell. I mean, I’m pretty
                        sure I did it
                        right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“D.C. is about sixty miles from here,” Bianca said. “Nico and I…” She frowned.
                        “We used to live
                        there. That’s…that’s strange. I’d forgotten.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I dislike this,” Zoë said. “We should go straight west. The prophecy said
                        west.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, like your tracking skills are better?” Thalia growled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë stepped toward her. “You challenge my skills, you scullion? You know <i
                            class="calibre5">nothing </i>of being a Hunter!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, <i class="calibre5">scullion</i>? You’re calling <i class="calibre5">me
                        </i>a scullion?
                        What the heck is a scullion?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whoa, you two,” Grover said nervously. “Come on. Not again!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grover’s right,” Bianca said. “D.C. is our best bet.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë didn’t look convinced, but she nodded reluctantly. “Very well. Let us keep
                        moving.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re going to get us arrested, driving,” Thalia grumbled. “I look closer to
                        sixteen than you
                        do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Perhaps,” Zoë snapped. “But I have been driving since automobiles were
                        invented. Let us go.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">As Blackjack and I continued south, following the van, I wondered whether Zoë
                        had been kidding.
                        I didn’t know exactly when cars were invented, but I figured that was like prehistoric
                        times—back when people
                        watched black-and-white TV and hunted dinosaurs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">How old <i class="calibre5">was </i>Zoë? And what had Mr. D been talking about?
                        What bad
                        experience had she had with heroes? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As we got closer to Washington, Blackjack started slowing down and dropping
                        altitude. He was
                        breathing heavily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You okay?” I asked him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Fine, boss. I could…I could take on an army.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You don’t sound so good.” And suddenly I felt guilty, because I’d been running
                        the pegasus for
                        half a day, nonstop, trying to keep up with highway traffic. Even for a flying horse, that had
                        to be rough. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Don’t worry about me, boss! I’m a tough one.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I figured he was right, but I also figured Blackjack would run himself into the
                        ground before
                        he complained, and I didn’t want that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Fortunately, the van started to slow down. It crossed the Potomac River into
                        central
                        Washington. I started thinking about air patrols and missiles and stuff like that. I didn’t know
                        exactly how all
                        those defenses worked, and wasn’t sure if pegasi even showed up on your typical military radar,
                        but I didn’t
                        want to find out by getting shot out of the sky. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Set me down there,” I told Blackjack. “That’s close enough.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Blackjack was so tired he didn’t complain. He dropped toward the Washington
                        Monument and set me
                        on the grass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The van was only a few blocks away. Zoë had parked at the curb. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at Blackjack. “I want you to go back to camp. Get some rest. Graze.
                        I’ll be fine.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Blackjack cocked his head skeptically. <i class="calibre5">You sure, boss? </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’ve done enough already,” I said. “I’ll be fine. And thanks a ton.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">A ton of hay, maybe, </i>Blackjack mused. <i
                            class="calibre5">That sounds
                            good. All right, but be careful, boss. I got a feeling they didn’t come here to meet
                            anything friendly and
                            handsome like me. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I promised to be careful. Then Blackjack took off, circling twice around the
                        monument before
                        disappearing into the clouds. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked over at the white van. Everybody was getting out. Grover pointed
                        toward one of the big
                        buildings lining the Mall. Thalia nodded, and the four of them trudged off into the cold wind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I started to follow. But then I froze. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A block away, the door of a black sedan opened. A man with gray hair and a
                        military buzz cut
                        got out. He was wearing dark shades and a black overcoat. Now, maybe in Washington, you’d
                        expected guys like
                        that to be everywhere. But it dawned on me that I’d seen this same car a couple of times on the
                        highway, going
                        south. It had been following the van. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The guy took out his mobile phone and said something into it. Then he looked
                        around, like he
                        was making sure the coast was clear, and started walking down the Mall in the direction of my
                        friends. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The worst of it was: when he turned toward me, I recognized his face. It was
                        Dr. Thorn, the
                        manticore from Westover Hall. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/9-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Invisibility cap on, I followed Thorn from a distance. My heart was pounding.
                        If <i class="calibre5">he </i>had survived that fall from the cliff, then Annabeth must have
                        too. My dreams had
                        been right. She was alive and being held prisoner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn kept well back from my friends, careful not to be seen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally, Grover stopped in front of a big building that said <small
                            class="calibre4">NATIONAL
                            AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM</small>. The Smithsonian! I’d been here a million years ago with my
                        mom, but everything
                        had looked so much bigger then. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia checked the door. It was open, but there weren’t many people going in.
                        Too cold, and
                        school was out of session. They slipped inside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn hesitated. I wasn’t sure why, but he didn’t go into the museum. He
                        turned and headed
                        across the Mall. I made a split-second decision and followed him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn crossed the street and climbed the steps of the Museum of Natural
                        History. There was a
                        big sign on the door. At first I thought it said <small class="calibre4">CLOSED FOR PIRATE
                            EVENT.</small> Then I
                        realized <small class="calibre4">PIRATE</small> must be <small class="calibre4">PRIVATE.
                        </small></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I followed Dr. Thorn inside, through a huge chamber full of mastodons and
                        dinosaur skeletons.
                        There were voices up ahead, coming from behind a set of closed doors. Two guards stood outside.
                        They opened the
                        doors for Thorn, and I had to sprint to get inside before they closed them again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Inside, what I saw was so terrible I almost gasped out loud, which probably
                        would’ve gotten me
                        killed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was in a huge round room with a balcony ringing the second level. At least a
                        dozen mortal
                        guards stood on the balcony, plus two monsters—reptilian women with double-snake trunks instead
                        of legs. I’d
                        seen them before. Annabeth had called them Scythian dracaenae. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But that wasn’t the worst of it. Standing between the snake women—I could swear
                        he was looking
                        straight down at me—was my old enemy Luke. He looked terrible. His skin was pale and his blond
                        hair looked
                        almost gray, as if he’d aged ten years in just a few months. The angry light in his eyes was
                        still there, and so
                        was the scar down the side of his face, where a dragon had once scratched him. But the scar was
                        now ugly red, as
                        though it had recently been reopened. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/9-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Next to him, sitting down so that the shadows covered him, was another man. All
                        I could see
                        were his knuckles on the gilded arms of his chair, like a throne. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well?” asked the man in the chair. His voice was just like the one I’d heard
                        in my dream—not
                        as creepy as Kronos’s, but deeper and stronger, like the earth itself was talking. It filled the
                        whole room even
                        though he wasn’t yelling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn took off his shades. His two-colored eyes, brown and blue, glittered
                        with excitement.
                        He made a stiff bow, then spoke in his weird French accent: “They are here, General.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know that, you fool,” boomed the man. “But where?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“In the rocket museum.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Air and Space Museum,” Luke corrected irritably. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn glared at Luke. “As you say, <i class="calibre5">sir</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I got the feeling Thorn would just as soon impale Luke with one of his spikes
                        as call him sir.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How many?” Luke asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn pretended not to hear. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“How many?” </i>the General demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Four, General,” Thorn said. “The satyr, Grover Underwood. And the girl with
                        the spiky black
                        hair and the—how do you say—<i class="calibre5">punk </i>clothes and the horrible shield.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thalia,” Luke said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And two other girls—Hunters. One wears a silver circlet.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">That </i>one I know,” the General growled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everyone in the room shifted uncomfortably. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Let me take them,” Luke said to the General. “We have more than enough—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Patience,” the General said. “They’ll have their hands full already. I’ve sent
                        a little
                        playmate to keep them occupied.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We cannot risk you, my boy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, <i class="calibre5">boy</i>,” Dr. Thorn said with a cruel smile. “You are
                        much too
                        fragile to risk. Let <i class="calibre5">me </i>finish them off.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No.” The General rose from his chair, and I got my first look at him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He was tall and muscular, with light brown skin and slicked-back dark hair. He
                        wore an
                        expensive brown silk suit like the guys on Wall Street wear, but you’d never mistake this dude
                        for a broker. He
                        had a brutal face, huge shoulders, and hands that could snap a flagpole in half. His eyes were
                        like stone. I
                        felt as if I were looking at a living statue. It was amazing he could even move. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“You have already failed me, Thorn,” he said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But, General—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No excuses!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn flinched. I’d thought Thorn was scary when I first saw him in his black
                        uniform at the
                        military academy. But now, standing before the General, Thorn looked like a silly wannabe
                        soldier. The General
                        was the real deal. He didn’t need a uniform. He was a born commander. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I should throw you into the pits of Tartarus for your incompetence,” the
                        General said. “I send
                        you to capture a child of the three elder gods, and you bring me a scrawny daughter of Athena.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But you promised me revenge!” Thorn protested. “A command of my own!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“<i class="calibre5">I </i>am Lord Kronos’s senior commander,” the General
                        said. “And I will
                        choose lieutenants who get me results! It was only thanks to Luke that we salvaged our plan at
                        all. Now get out
                        of my sight, Thorn, until I find some other menial task for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn’s face turned purple with rage. I thought he was going to start frothing
                        at the mouth or
                        shooting spines, but he just bowed awkwardly and left the room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now, my boy.” The General turned to Luke. “The first thing we must do is
                        isolate the
                        half-blood Thalia. The monster we seek will then come to her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Hunters will be difficult to dispose of,” Luke said. “Zoë Nightshade—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Do not speak her name!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke swallowed. “S–sorry, General. I just—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The General silenced him with a wave of his hand. “Let me show you, my boy, how
                        we will bring
                        the Hunters down.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He pointed to a guard on the ground level. “Do you have the teeth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The guy stumbled forward with a ceramic pot. “Yes, General!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Plant them,” he said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In the center of the room was a big circle of dirt, where I guess a dinosaur
                        exhibit was
                        supposed to go. I watched nervously as the guard took sharp white teeth out of the pot and
                        pushed them into the
                        soil. He smoothed them over while the General smiled coldly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The guard stepped back from the dirt and wiped his hands. “Ready, General!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Excellent! Water them, and we will let them scent their prey.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The guard picked up a little tin watering can with daisies painted on it, which
                        was kind of
                        bizarre, because what he poured out wasn’t water. It was dark red liquid, and I got the feeling
                        it wasn’t
                        Hawaiian Punch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The soil began to bubble. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Soon,” the General said, “I will show you, Luke, soldiers that will make your
                        army from that
                        little boat look insignificant.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke clenched his fists. “I’ve spent a year training my forces! When the <i
                            class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda </i>arrives at the mountain, they’ll be the best—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ha!” the General said. “I don’t deny your troops will make a fine honor guard
                        for Lord Kronos.
                        And you, of course, will have a role to play—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought Luke turned paler when the General said that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“—but under my leadership, the forces of Lord Kronos will increase a
                        hundredfold. We will be
                        unstoppable. Behold, my ultimate killing machines.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The soil erupted. I stepped back nervously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In each spot where a tooth had been planted, a creature was struggling out of
                        the dirt. The
                        first of them said: </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mew?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was a kitten. A little orange tabby with stripes like a tiger. Then another
                        appeared, until
                        there were a dozen, rolling around and playing in the dirt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everyone stared at them in disbelief. The General roared, <i
                            class="calibre5">“What is this?
                            Cute cuddly kittens? Where did you find those teeth?” </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The guard who’d brought the teeth cowered in fear. “From the exhibit, sir! Just
                        like you said.
                        The saber-toothed tiger—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, you idiot! I said the tyrannosaurus! Gather up those…those infernal fuzzy
                        little beasts
                        and take them outside. And never let me see your face again.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The terrified guard dropped his watering can. He gathered up the kittens and
                        scampered out of
                        the room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You!” The General pointed to another guard. “Get me the <i
                            class="calibre5">right teeth.
                            NOW!</i>” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The new guard ran off to carry out his orders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Imbeciles,” muttered the General. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This is why I don’t use mortals,” Luke said. “They are unreliable.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They are weak-minded, easily bought, and violent,” the General said. “I love
                        them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A minute later, the guard hustled into the room with his hands full of large
                        pointy teeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Excellent,” the General said. He climbed onto the balcony railing and jumped
                        down, twenty
                        feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Where he landed, the marble floor cracked under his leather shoes. He stood,
                        wincing, and
                        rubbed his shoulders. “Curse my stiff neck.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Another hot pad, sir?” a guard asked. “More Tylenol?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No! It will pass.” The General brushed off his silk suit, then snatched up the
                        teeth. “I shall
                        do this myself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He held up one of the teeth and smiled. “Dinosaur teeth—ha! Those foolish
                        mortals don’t even
                        know when they have dragon teeth in their possession. And not just <i class="calibre5">any
                        </i>dragon teeth.
                        These come from the ancient Sybaris herself! They shall do nicely.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He planted them in the dirt, twelve in all. Then he scooped up the watering
                        can. He sprinkled
                        the soil with red liquid, tossed the can away, and held his arms out wide. “Rise!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The dirt trembled. A single, skeletal hand shot out of the ground, grasping at
                        the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The General looked up at the balcony. “Quickly, do you have the scent?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yesssss, lord,” one of the snake ladies said. She took out a sash of silvery
                        fabric, like the
                        kind the Hunters wore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Excellent,” the General said. “Once my warriors catch its scent, they will
                        pursue its owner
                        relentlessly. Nothing can stop them, no weapons known to half-blood or Hunter. They will tear
                        the Hunters and
                        their allies to shreds. Toss it here!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As he said that, skeletons erupted from the ground. There were twelve of them,
                        one for each
                        tooth the General had planted. They were nothing like Halloween skeletons, or the kind you might
                        see in cheesy
                        movies. These were growing flesh as I watched, turning into men, but men with dull gray skin,
                        yellow eyes, and
                        modern clothes—gray muscle shirts, camo pants, and combat boots. If you didn’t look too closely,
                        you could
                        almost believe they were human, but their flesh was transparent and their bones shimmered
                        underneath, like X-ray
                        images. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">One of them looked straight at me, regarding me coldly, and I knew that no cap
                        of invisibility
                        would fool it. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/9-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The snake lady released the scarf and it fluttered down toward the General’s
                        hand. As soon as
                        he gave it to the warriors, they would hunt Zoë and the other hunters until they were extinct.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t have time to think. I ran and jumped with all my might, plowing into
                        the warriors and
                        snatching the scarf out of the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What’s this?” bellowed the General. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I landed at the feet of a skeleton warrior, who hissed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“An intruder,” the General growled. “One cloaked in darkness. Seal the doors!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s Percy Jackson!” Luke yelled. “It has to be.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sprinted for the exit, but heard a ripping sound and realized the skeleton
                        warrior had taken
                        a chunk out of my sleeve. When I glanced back, he was holding the fabric up to his nose,
                        sniffing the scent,
                        handing it around to his friends. I wanted to scream, but I couldn’t. I squeezed through the
                        door just as the
                        guards slammed it shut behind me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And then I ran. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">I tore across the Mall, not daring to look behind me. I burst into the Air and
                        Space Museum and
                        took off my invisibility cap once I was through the admissions area. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The main part of the museum was one huge room with rockets and airplanes
                        hanging from the
                        ceiling. Three levels of balconies curled around, so you could look at the exhibits from all
                        different heights.
                        The place wasn’t crowded, just a few families and a couple of tour groups of kids, probably
                        doing one of those
                        holiday school trips. I wanted to yell at them all to leave, but I figured that would only get
                        me arrested. I
                        had to find Thalia and Grover and the Hunters. Any minute, the skeleton dudes were going to
                        invade the museum,
                        and I didn’t think they would settle for an audio tour. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I ran into Thalia—literally. I was barreling up the ramp to the top-floor
                        balcony and slammed
                        into her, knocking her into an Apollo space capsule. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover yelped in surprise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before I could regain my balance, Zoë and Bianca had arrows notched, aimed at
                        my chest. Their
                        bows had just appeared out of nowhere. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When Zoë realized who I was, she didn’t seem anxious to lower her bow. “You!
                        How dare you show
                        thy face here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Grover said. “Thank goodness.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë glared at him, and he blushed. “I mean, um, gosh. You’re not supposed to be
                        here!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Luke,” I said, trying to catch my breath. “He’s here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The anger in Thalia’s eyes immediately melted. She put her hand on her silver
                        bracelet.
                        “Where?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I told them about the Natural History Museum, Dr. Thorn, Luke, and the General.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The General is <i class="calibre5">here</i>?” Zoë looked stunned. “That is
                        impossible! You
                        lie.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why would I lie? Look, there’s no time. Skeleton warriors—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“What?” </i>Thalia demanded. “How many?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Twelve,” I said. “And that’s not all. That guy, the General, he said he was
                        sending something,
                        a ‘playmate,’ to distract you over here. A monster.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia and Grover exchanged looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We were following Artemis’s trail,” Grover said. “I was pretty sure it led
                        here. Some powerful
                        monster scent…She must’ve stopped here looking for the mystery monster. But we haven’t found
                        anything yet.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zoë,” Bianca said nervously, “if it <i class="calibre5">is </i>the General—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It <i class="calibre5">cannot </i>be!” Zoë snapped. “Percy must have seen an
                        Iris-message or
                        some other illusion.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Illusions don’t crack marble floors,” I told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. I didn’t know why she was
                        taking it so
                        personally, or how she knew this General guy, but I figured now wasn’t the time to ask. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“If Percy is telling the truth about the skeleton warriors,” she said, “we have
                        no time to
                        argue. They are the worst, the most horrible…We must leave now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Good idea,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I was <i class="calibre5">not </i>including thee, boy,” Zoë said. “You are not
                        part of this
                        quest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, I’m trying to save your lives!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You shouldn’t have come, Percy,” Thalia said grimly. “But you’re here now.
                        Come on. Let’s get
                        back to the van.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That is not thy decision!” Zoë snapped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia scowled at her. “You’re not the boss here, Zoë. I don’t care how old you
                        are! You’re
                        still a conceited little brat!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You never had any wisdom when it came to boys,” Zoë growled. “You never could
                        leave them
                        behind!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia looked like she was about to hit Zoë. Then everyone froze. I heard a
                        growl so loud I
                        thought one of the rocket engines was starting up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Below us, a few adults screamed. A little kid’s voice screeched with delight:
                        “Kitty!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Something enormous bounded up the ramp. It was the size of a pick-up truck,
                        with silver claws
                        and golden glittering fur. I’d seen this monster once before. Two years ago, I’d glimpsed it
                        briefly from a
                        train. Now, up close and personal, it looked even bigger. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Nemean Lion,” Thalia said. “Don’t move.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The lion roared so loud it parted my hair. Its fangs gleamed like stainless
                        steel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Separate on my mark,” Zoë said. “Try to keep it distracted.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Until when?” Grover asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Until I think of a way to kill it. Go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I uncapped Riptide and rolled to the left. Arrows whistled past me, and Grover
                        played a sharp
                        <i class="calibre5">tweet-tweet </i>cadence on his reed pipes. I turned and saw Zoë and Bianca
                        climbing the
                        Apollo capsule. They were firing arrows, one after another, all shattering harmlessly against
                        the lion’s
                        metallic fur. The lion swiped the capsule and tipped it on its side, spilling the Hunters off
                        the back. Grover
                        played a frantic, horrible tune, and the lion turned toward him, but Thalia stepped into its
                        path, holding up
                        Aegis, and the lion recoiled. <i class="calibre5">“ROOOAAAR!” </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hi-yah!” Thalia said. “Back!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The lion growled and clawed the air, but it retreated as if the shield were a
                        blazing fire.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">For a second, I thought Thalia had it under control. Then I saw the lion
                        crouching, its leg
                        muscles tensing. I’d seen enough cat fights in the alleys around my apartment in New York. I
                        knew the lion was
                        going to pounce. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” I yelled. I don’t know what I was thinking, but I charged the beast. I
                        just wanted to
                        get it away from my friends. I slashed with Riptide, a good strike to the flank that should’ve
                        cut the monster
                        into Meow Mix, but the blade just clanged against its fur in a burst of sparks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The lion raked me with its claws, ripping off a chunk of my coat. I backed
                        against the railing.
                        It sprang at me, one thousand pounds of monster, and I had no choice but to turn and jump. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I landed on the wing of an old-fashioned silver airplane, which pitched and
                        almost spilled me
                        to the floor, three stories below. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">An arrow whizzed past my head. The lion jumped onto the aircraft, and the cords
                        holding the
                        plane began to groan. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The lion swiped at me, and I dropped onto the next exhibit, a weird-looking
                        spacecraft with
                        blades like a helicopter. I looked up and saw the lion roar—inside its maw, a pink tongue and
                        throat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Its mouth, I thought. Its fur was completely invulnerable, but if I could
                        strike it in the
                        mouth…The only problem was, the monster moved too quickly. Between its claws and fangs, I
                        couldn’t get close
                        without getting sliced to pieces. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zoë!” I shouted. “Target the mouth!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The monster lunged. An arrow zipped past it, missing completely, and I dropped
                        from the
                        spaceship onto the top of a floor exhibit, a huge model of the earth. I slid down Russia and
                        dropped off the
                        equator. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Nemean Lion growled and steadied itself on the spacecraft, but its weight
                        was too much. One
                        of the cords snapped. As the display swung down like a pendulum, the lion leaped off onto the
                        model earth’s
                        North Pole. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grover!” I yelled. “Clear the area!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Groups of kids were running around screaming. Grover tried to corral them away
                        from the monster
                        just as the other cord on the spaceship snapped and the exhibit crashed to the floor. Thalia
                        dropped off the
                        second-floor railing and landed across from me, on the other side of the globe. The lion
                        regarded us both,
                        trying to decide which of us to kill first. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë and Bianca were above us, bows ready, but they kept having to move around
                        to get a good
                        angle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No clear shot!” Zoë yelled. “Get it to open its mouth more!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The lion snarled from the top of the globe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked around. <i class="calibre5">Options. </i>I needed…</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The gift shop. I had a vague memory from my trip here as a little kid.
                        Something I’d made my
                        mom buy me, and I’d regretted it. If they still sold that stuff…</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thalia,” I said, “keep it occupied.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She nodded grimly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hi-yah!” She pointed her spear and a spidery arc of blue electricity shot out,
                        zapping the
                        lion in the tail. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“ROOOOOOOAR!” </i>The lion turned and pounced. Thalia
                        rolled out of its
                        way, holding up Aegis to keep the monster at bay, and I ran for the gift shop. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This is no time for souvenirs, boy!” Zoë yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I dashed into the shop, knocking over rows of T-shirts, jumping over tables
                        full of
                        glow-in-the-dark planets and space ooze. The sales lady didn’t protest. She was too busy
                        cowering behind her
                        cash register. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There! On the far wall—glittery silver packets. Whole racks of them. I scooped
                        up every kind I
                        could find and ran out of the shop with an armful. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë and Bianca were still showering arrows on the monster, but it was no good.
                        The lion seemed
                        to know better than to open its mouth too much. It snapped at Thalia, slashing with its claws.
                        It even kept its
                        eyes narrowed to tiny slits. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia jabbed at the monster and backed up. The lion pressed her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” she called, “whatever you’re going to do—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The lion roared and swatted her like a cat toy, sending her flying into the
                        side of a Titan
                        rocket. Her head hit the metal and she slid to the floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” I yelled at the lion. I was too far away to strike, so I took a risk: I
                        hurled Riptide
                        like a throwing knife. It bounced off the lion’s side, but that was enough to get the monster’s
                        attention. It
                        turned toward me and snarled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was only one way to get close enough. I charged, and as the lion leaped
                        to intercept me,
                        I chunked a space food pouch into its maw—a chunk of cellophane-wrapped, freeze-dried strawberry
                        parfait. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The lion’s eyes got wide and it gagged like a cat with a hairball. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t blame it. I remembered feeling the same way when I’d tried to eat
                        space food as a
                        kid. The stuff was just plain nasty. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zoë, get ready!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Behind me, I could hear people screaming. Grover was playing another horrible
                        song on his
                        pipes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I scrambled away from the lion. It managed to choke down the space food packet
                        and looked at me
                        with pure hate. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Snack time!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It made the mistake of roaring at me, and I got an ice-cream sandwich in its
                        throat.
                        Fortunately, I had always been a pretty good pitcher, even though baseball wasn’t my game.
                        Before the lion could
                        stop gagging, I shot in two more flavors of ice cream and a freeze-dried spaghetti dinner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The lion’s eyes bugged. It opened its mouth wide and reared up on its back
                        paws, trying to get
                        away from me. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/10-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Immediately, arrows pierced the lion’s maw—two, four, six. The lion thrashed
                        wildly, turned,
                        and fell backward. And then it was still. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Alarms wailed throughout the museum. People were flocking to the exits.
                        Security guards were
                        running around in a panic with no idea what was going on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover knelt at Thalia’s side and helped her up. She seemed okay, just a little
                        dazed. Zoë and
                        Bianca dropped from the balcony and landed next to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë eyed me cautiously. “That was…an interesting strategy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, it worked.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She didn’t argue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The lion seemed to be melting, the way dead monsters do sometimes, until there
                        was nothing left
                        but its glittering fur coat, and even that seemed to be shrinking to the size of a normal lion’s
                        pelt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Take it,” Zoë told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at her. “What, the lion’s fur? Isn’t that, like, an animal rights
                        violation or
                        something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It is a spoil of war,” she told me. “It is rightly thine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You killed it,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She shook her head, almost smiling. “I think thy ice-cream sandwich did that.
                        Fair is fair,
                        Percy Jackson. Take the fur.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I lifted it up; it was surprisingly light. The fur was smooth and soft. It
                        didn’t feel at all
                        like something that could stop a blade. As I watched, the pelt shifted and changed into a coat—a
                        full-length
                        golden-brown duster. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Not exactly my style,” I murmured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We have to get out of here,” Grover said. “The security guards won’t stay
                        confused for long.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I noticed for the first time how strange it was that the guards hadn’t rushed
                        forward to arrest
                        us. They were scrambling in all directions except ours, like they were madly searching for
                        something. A few were
                        running into the walls or each other. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You did that?” I asked Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He nodded, looking a little embarrassed. “A minor confusion song. I played some
                        Barry Manilow.
                        It works every time. But it’ll only last a few seconds.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The security guards are not our biggest worry,” Zoë said. “Look.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Through the glass walls of the museum, I could see a group of men walking
                        across the lawn. Gray
                        men in gray camouflage outfits. They were too far away for us to see their eyes, but I could
                        feel their gaze
                        aimed straight at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Go,” I said. “They’ll be hunting me. I’ll distract them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” Zoë said. “We go together.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at her. “But, you said—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You are part of this quest now,” Zoë said grudgingly. “I do not like it, but
                        there is no
                        changing fate. <i class="calibre5">You </i>are the fifth quest member. And we are not leaving
                        anyone behind.”

                    <p class="no-indent">We were crossing the Potomac when we spotted the helicopter. It was a sleek,
                        black military
                        model just like the one we’d seen at Westover Hall. And it was coming straight toward us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They know the van,” I said. “We have to ditch it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë swerved into the fast lane. The helicopter was gaining. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Maybe the military will shoot it down,” Grover said hopefully. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The military probably thinks it’s one of theirs,” I said. “How can the General
                        use mortals,
                        anyway?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mercenaries,” Zoë said bitterly. “It is distasteful, but many mortals will
                        fight for any cause
                        as long as they are paid.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But don’t these mortals see who they’re working for?” I asked. “Don’t they
                        notice all the
                        monsters around them?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë shook her head. “I do not know how much they see through the Mist. I doubt
                        it would matter
                        to them if they knew the truth. Sometimes mortals can be more horrible than monsters.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The helicopter kept coming, making a lot better time than we were through D.C.
                        traffic. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia closed her eyes and prayed hard. “Hey, Dad. A lightning bolt would be
                        nice about now.
                        Please?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But the sky stayed gray and snowy. No sign of a helpful thunderstorm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There!” Bianca said. “That parking lot!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll be trapped,” Zoë said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Trust me,” Bianca said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë shot across two lanes of traffic and into a mall parking lot on the south
                        bank of the
                        river. We left the van and followed Bianca down some steps. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/11-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Subway entrance,” Bianca said. “Let’s go south. Alexandria.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Anything,” Thalia agreed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We bought tickets and got through the turnstiles, looking behind us for any
                        signs of pursuit. A
                        few minutes later we were safely aboard a southbound train, riding away from D.C. As our train
                        came above
                        ground, we could see the helicopter circling the parking lot, but it didn’t come after us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover let out a sigh. “Nice job, Bianca, thinking of the subway.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca looked pleased. “Yeah, well. I saw that station when Nico and I came
                        through last
                        summer. I remember being really surprised to see it, because it wasn’t here when we used to live
                        in D.C.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover frowned. “New? But that station looked really old.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I guess,” Bianca said. “But trust me, when we lived here as little kids, there
                        was no subway.”
                        Thalia sat forward. “Wait a minute. No subway at all?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Now, I knew nothing about D.C., but I didn’t see how their whole subway system
                        could be less
                        than twelve years old. I guess everyone else was thinking the same thing, because they looked
                        pretty confused.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bianca,” Zoë said. “How long ago…” Her voice faltered. The sound of the
                        helicopter was getting
                        louder again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We need to change trains,” I said. “Next station.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Over the next half hour, all we thought about was getting away safely. We
                        changed trains twice.
                        I had no idea where we were going, but after a while we lost the helicopter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Unfortunately, when we finally got off the train we found ourselves at the end
                        of the line, in
                        an industrial area with nothing but warehouses and railway tracks. And snow. Lots of snow. It
                        seemed much colder
                        here. I was glad for my new lion’s fur coat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We wandered through the railway yard, thinking there might be another passenger
                        train
                        somewhere, but there were just rows and rows of freight cars, most of which were covered in
                        snow, like they
                        hadn’t moved in years. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A homeless guy was standing at a trash-can fire. We must’ve looked pretty
                        pathetic, because he
                        gave us a toothless grin and said, “Y’all need to get warmed up? Come on over!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We huddled around his fire. Thalia’s teeth were chattering. She said, “Well
                        this is
                        g-g-g-great.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“My hooves are frozen,” Grover complained. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“Feet,” </i>I corrected, for the sake of the homeless guy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Maybe we should contact camp,” Bianca said. “Chiron—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” Zoë said. “They cannot help us any more. We must finish this quest
                        ourselves.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I gazed miserably around the rail yard. Somewhere, far to the west, Annabeth
                        was in danger.
                        Artemis was in chains. A doomsday monster was on the loose. And we were stuck on the outskirts
                        of D.C., sharing
                        a homeless person’s fire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You know,” the homeless man said, “you’re never completely without friends.”
                        His face was
                        grimy and his beard tangled, but his expression seemed kindly. “You kids need a train going
                        west?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, sir,” I said. “You know of any?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He pointed one greasy hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Suddenly I noticed a freight train, gleaming and free of snow. It was one of
                        those
                        automobile-carrier trains, with steel mesh curtains and a triple-deck of cars inside. The side
                        of the freight
                        train said <small class="calibre4">SUN WEST LINE</small>. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/11-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s…convenient,” Thalia said. “Thanks, uh…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She turned to the homeless guy, but he was gone. The trash can in front of us
                        was cold and
                        empty, as if he’d taken the flames with him. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">An hour later we were rumbling west. There was no problem about who would drive
                        now, because we
                        all got our own luxury car. Zoë and Bianca were crashed out in a Lexus on the top deck. Grover
                        was playing race
                        car driver behind the wheel of a Lamborghini. And Thalia had hot-wired the radio in a black
                        Mercedes SLK so she
                        could pick up the altrock stations from D.C. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Join you?” I asked her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She shrugged, so I climbed into the shotgun seat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The radio was playing the White Stripes. I knew the song because it was one of
                        the only CDs I
                        owned that my mom liked. She said it reminded her of Led Zeppelin. Thinking about my mom made me
                        sad, because it
                        didn’t seem likely I’d be home for Christmas. I might not live that long. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nice coat,” Thalia told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I pulled the brown duster around me, thankful for the warmth. “Yeah, but the
                        Nemean Lion wasn’t
                        the monster we’re looking for.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/11-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not even close. We’ve got a long way to go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whatever this mystery monster is, the General said it would come for you. They
                        wanted to
                        isolate you from the group, so the monster will appear and battle you one-on-one.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He said that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, something like that. Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s great. I love being used as bait.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No idea what the monster might be?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She shook her head morosely. “But you know where we’re going, don’t you? San
                        Francisco. That’s
                        where Artemis was heading.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I remembered something Annabeth had said at the dance: how her dad was moving
                        to San Francisco,
                        and there was no way she could go. Half-bloods couldn’t live there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why?” I asked. “What’s so bad about San Francisco?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Mist is really thick there because the Mountain of Despair is so near.
                        Titan magic—what’s
                        left of it—still lingers. Monsters are attracted to that area like you wouldn’t believe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What’s the Mountain of Despair?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia raised an eyebrow. “You really don’t know? Ask stupid Zoë. She’s the
                        expert.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She glared out the windshield. I wanted to ask her what she was talking about,
                        but I also
                        didn’t want to sound like an idiot. I hated feeling like Thalia knew more than I did, so I kept
                        my mouth shut.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The afternoon sun shone through the steel-mesh side of the freight car, casting
                        a shadow across
                        Thalia’s face. I thought about how different she was from Zoë—Zoë all formal and aloof like a
                        princess, Thalia
                        with her ratty clothes and her rebel attitude. But there was something similar about them, too.
                        The same kind of
                        toughness. Right now, sitting in the shadows with a gloomy expression, Thalia looked a lot like
                        one of the
                        Hunters. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then suddenly, it hit me: “That’s why you don’t get along with Zoë.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia frowned. “What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Hunters tried to recruit you,” I guessed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her eyes got dangerously bright. I thought she was going to zap me out of the
                        Mercedes, but she
                        just sighed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I almost joined them,” she admitted. “Luke, Annabeth, and I ran into them
                        once, and Zoë tried
                        to convince me. She almost did, but…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia’s fingers gripped the wheel. “I would’ve had to leave Luke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zoë and I got into a fight. She told me I was being stupid. She said I’d
                        regret my choice. She
                        said Luke would let me down someday.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I watched the sun through the metal curtain. We seemed to be traveling faster
                        each
                        second—shadows flickering like an old movie projector. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s harsh,” I said. “Hard to admit Zoë was right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“She <i class="calibre5">wasn’t </i>right! Luke <i class="calibre5">never
                        </i>let me down.
                        Never.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll have to fight him,” I said. “There’s no way around it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia didn’t answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You haven’t seen him lately,” I warned. “I know it’s hard to believe, but—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll do what I have to.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Even if that means killing him?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Do me a favor,” she said. “Get out of my car.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I felt so bad for her I didn’t argue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As I was about to leave, she said, “Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When I looked back, her eyes were red, but I couldn’t tell if it was from anger
                        or sadness.
                        “Annabeth wanted to join the Hunters, too. Maybe you should think about why.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before I could respond, she raised the power windows and shut me out.</p>

                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I sat in the driver’s seat of Grover’s Lamborghini. Grover was asleep in the
                        back. He’d finally
                        given up trying to impress Zoë and Bianca with his pipe music after he played “Poison Ivy” and
                        caused that very
                        stuff to sprout from their Lexus’s air conditioner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As I watched the sun go down, I thought of Annabeth. I was afraid to go to
                        sleep. I was worried
                        what I might dream. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, don’t be afraid of dreams,” a voice said right next to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked over. Somehow, I wasn’t surprised to find the homeless guy from the
                        rail yard sitting
                        in the shotgun seat. His jeans were so worn out they were almost white. His coat was ripped,
                        with stuffing
                        coming out. He looked kind of like a teddy bear that had been run over by a truck. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“If it weren’t for dreams,” he said, “I wouldn’t know half the things I know
                        about the future.
                        They’re better than Olympus tabloids.” He cleared his throat, then held up his hands
                        dramatically: </p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="center"><i class="calibre5">“Dreams like a podcast, </i></p>
                    <p class="center"><i class="calibre5">Downloading truth in my ears. </i></p>
                    <p class="center"><i class="calibre5">They tell me cool stuff.” </i></p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Apollo?” I guessed, because I figured nobody else could make a haiku that bad.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He put his finger to his lips. “I’m incognito. Call me Fred.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A god named Fred?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Eh, well…Zeus insists on certain rules. Hands off, when there’s a human quest.
                        Even when
                        something really major is wrong. But nobody messes with my baby sister. <i
                            class="calibre5">Nobody</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Can you help us, then?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Shhh. I already have. Haven’t you been looking outside?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The train. How fast are we moving?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo chuckled. “Fast enough. Unfortunately, we’re running out of time. It’s
                        almost sunset.
                        But I imagine we’ll get you across a good chunk of America, at least.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But where is Artemis?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His face darkened. “I know a lot, and I see a lot. But even I don’t know that.
                        She’s…clouded
                        from me. I don’t like it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And Annabeth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He frowned. “Oh, you mean that girl you lost? Hmm. I don’t know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried not to feel mad. I knew the gods had a hard time taking mortals
                        seriously, even
                        half-bloods. We lived such short lives, compared to the gods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What about the monster Artemis was seeking?” I asked. “Do you know what it
                        is?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” Apollo said. “But there is one who might. If you haven’t yet found the
                        monster when you
                        reach San Francisco, seek out Nereus, the Old Man of the Sea. He has a long memory and a sharp
                        eye. He has the
                        gift of knowledge sometimes kept obscure from my Oracle.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But it’s <i class="calibre5">your </i>Oracle,” I protested. “Can’t you tell us
                        what the
                        prophecy means?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo sighed. “You might as well ask an artist to explain his art, or ask a
                        poet to explain
                        his poem. It defeats the purpose. The meaning is only clear through the search.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“In other words, you don’t know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo checked his watch. “Ah, look at the time! I have to run. I doubt I can
                        risk helping you
                        again, Percy, but remember what I said! Get some sleep! And when you return, I expect a good
                        haiku about your
                        journey!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to protest that I wasn’t tired and I’d never made up a haiku in my
                        life, but Apollo
                        snapped his fingers, and the next thing I knew I was closing my eyes. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">In my dream, I was somebody else. I was wearing an old-fashioned Greek tunic,
                        which was a
                        little too breezy downstairs, and laced leather sandals. The Nemean Lion’s skin was wrapped
                        around my back like
                        a cape, and I was running somewhere, being pulled along by a girl who was tightly gripping my
                        hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hurry!” she said. It was too dark to see her face clearly, but I could hear
                        the fear in her
                        voice. “He will find us!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was nighttime. A million stars blazed above. We were running through tall
                        grass, and the
                        scent of a thousand different flowers made the air intoxicating. It was a beautiful garden, and
                        yet the girl was
                        leading me through it, as if we were about to die. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m not afraid,” I tried to tell her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You should be!” she said, pulling me along. She had long dark hair braided
                        down her back. Her
                        silk robes glowed faintly in the starlight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We raced up the side of the hill. She pulled me behind a thorn bush and we
                        collapsed, both
                        breathing heavily. I didn’t know why the girl was scared. The garden seemed so peaceful. And I
                        felt strong.
                        Stronger than I’d ever felt before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There is no need to run,” I told her. My voice sounded deeper, much more
                        confident. “I have
                        bested a thousand monsters with my bare hands.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not this one,” the girl said. “Ladon is too strong. You must go around, up the
                        mountain to my
                        father. It is the only way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The hurt in her voice surprised me. She was really concerned, almost like she
                        cared about me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t trust your father,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You should not,” the girl agreed. “You will have to trick him. But you cannot
                        take the prize
                        directly. You will die!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I chuckled. “Then why don’t you help me, pretty one?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I…I am afraid. Ladon will stop me. My sisters, if they found out…they would
                        disown me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then there’s nothing for it.” I stood up, rubbing my hands together. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait!” the girl said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She seemed to be agonizing over a decision. Then, her fingers trembling, she
                        reached up and
                        plucked a long white brooch from her hair. “If you must fight, take this. My mother, Pleione,
                        gave it to me. She
                        was a daughter of the ocean, and the ocean’s power is within it. <i class="calibre5">My
                        </i>immortal power.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The girl breathed on the pin and it glowed faintly. It gleamed in the starlight
                        like polished
                        abalone. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/11-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Take it,” she told me. “And make of it a weapon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I laughed. “A hairpin? How will this slay Ladon, pretty one?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It may not,” she admitted. “But it is all I can offer, if you insist on being
                        stubborn.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The girl’s voice softened my heart. I reached down and took the hairpin, and as
                        I did, it grew
                        longer and heavier in my hand, until I held a familiar bronze sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well balanced,” I said. “Though I usually prefer to use my bare hands. What
                        shall I name this
                        blade?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Anaklusmos,” the girl said sadly. “The current that takes one by surprise. And
                        before you know
                        it, you have been swept out to sea.” </p>
                    <p class="no-indent">Before I could thank her, there was a trampling sound in the grass, a hiss like
                        air escaping a
                        tire, and the girl said, “Too late! He is here!” </p>
                    <p class="no-indent">I sat bolt upright in the Lamborghini’s driver’s seat. Grover was shaking my
                        arm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” he said. “It’s morning. The train’s stopped. Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to shake off my drowsiness. Thalia, Zoë, and Bianca had already rolled
                        up the metal
                        curtains. Outside were snowy mountains dotted with pine trees, the sun rising red between two
                        peaks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I fished my pen out of my pocket and stared at it. <i
                            class="calibre5">Anaklusmos</i>, the
                        Ancient Greek name for Riptide. A different form, but I was sure it was the same blade I’d seen
                        in my dream.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And I was sure of something else, too. The girl I had seen was Zoë Nightshade.

                    <p class="no-indent">We’d arrived on the outskirts of a little ski town nestled in the mountains.
                        The sign said
                        <small class="calibre4">WELCOME TO CLOUDCROFT, NEW MEXICO</small>. The air was cold and thin.
                        The roofs of the
                        cabins were heaped with snow, and dirty mounds of it were piled up on the sides of the streets.
                        Tall pine trees
                        loomed over the valley, casting pitch-black shadows, though the morning was sunny.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Even with my lion-skin coat, I was freezing by the time we got to Main Street,
                        which was about
                        half a mile from the train tracks. As we walked, I told Grover about my conversation with Apollo
                        the night
                        before—how he’d told me to seek out Nereus in San Francisco. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked uneasy. “That’s good, I guess. But we’ve got to get there first.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried not to get too depressed about our chances. I didn’t want to send
                        Grover into a panic,
                        but I knew we had another huge deadline looming, aside from saving Artemis in time for her
                        council of the gods.
                        The General had said Annabeth would only be kept alive until the winter solstice. That was
                        Friday, only four
                        days away. And he’d said something about a sacrifice. I didn’t like the sound of that at all.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We stopped in the middle of town. You could pretty much see everything from
                        there: a school, a
                        bunch of tourist stores and cafes, some ski cabins, and a grocery store. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Great,” Thalia said, looking around. “No bus station. No taxis. No car rental.
                        No way out.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There’s a coffee shop!” said Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes,” Zoë said. “Coffee is good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And pastries,” Grover said dreamily. “And wax paper.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia sighed. “Fine. How about you two go get us some food. Percy, Bianca, and
                        I will check in
                        the grocery store. Maybe they can give us directions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We agreed to meet back in front of the grocery store in fifteen minutes. Bianca
                        looked a little
                        uncomfortable coming with us, but she did. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Inside the store, we found out a few valuable things about Cloudcroft: there
                        wasn’t enough snow
                        for skiing, the grocery store sold rubber rats for a dollar each, and there was no easy way in
                        or out of town
                        unless you had your own car. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You could call for a taxi from Alamogordo,” the clerk said doubtfully. “That’s
                        down at the
                        bottom of the mountains, but it would take at least an hour to get here. Cost several hundred
                        dollars.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The clerk looked so lonely, I bought a rubber rat. Then we headed back outside
                        and stood on the
                        porch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wonderful,” Thalia grumped. “I’m going to walk down the street, see if anybody
                        in the other
                        shops has a suggestion.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But the clerk said—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know,” she told me. “I’m checking anyway.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I let her go. I knew how it felt to be restless. All half-bloods had attention
                        deficit problems
                        because of our inborn battlefield reflexes. We couldn’t stand just waiting around. Also, I had a
                        feeling Thalia
                        was still upset over our conversation last night about Luke. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca and I stood together awkwardly. I mean…I was never very comfortable
                        talking one-on-one
                        with girls anyway, and I’d never been alone with Bianca before. I wasn’t sure what to say,
                        especially now that
                        she was a Hunter and everything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nice rat,” she said at last. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I set it on the porch railing. Maybe it would attract more business for the
                        store. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So…how do you like being a Hunter so far?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pursed her lips. “You’re not still mad at me for joining, are you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nah. Long as, you know…you’re happy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m not sure ‘happy’ is the right word, with Lady Artemis gone. But being a
                        Hunter is
                        definitely cool. I feel calmer somehow. Everything seems to have slowed down around me. I guess
                        that’s the
                        immortality.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at her, trying to see the difference. She did seem more confident than
                        before, more at
                        peace. She didn’t hide her face under a green cap anymore. She kept her hair tied back, and she
                        looked me right
                        in the eyes when she spoke. With a shiver, I realized that five hundred or a thousand years from
                        now, Bianca di
                        Angelo would look exactly the same as she did today. She might be having a conversation like
                        this with some
                        other half-blood long after I was dead, but Bianca would still look twelve years old. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nico didn’t understand my decision,” Bianca murmured. She looked at me like
                        she wanted
                        assurance it was okay. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He’ll be all right,” I said. “Camp Half-Blood takes in a lot of young kids.
                        They did that for
                        Annabeth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca nodded. “I hope we find her. Annabeth, I mean. She’s lucky to have a
                        friend like you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Lot of good it did her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t blame yourself, Percy. You risked your life to save my brother and me. I
                        mean, that was
                        seriously brave. If I hadn’t met you, I wouldn’t have felt okay about leaving Nico at the camp.
                        I figured if
                        there were people like you there, Nico would be fine. You’re a good guy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The compliment took me by surprise. “Even though I knocked you down in capture
                        the flag?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She laughed. “Okay. Except for that, you’re a good guy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A couple hundred yards away, Grover and Zoë came out of the coffee shop loaded
                        down with pastry
                        bags and drinks. I kind of didn’t want them to come back yet. It was weird, but I realized I
                        liked talking to
                        Bianca. She wasn’t so bad. A lot easier to hang out with than Zoë Nightshade, anyway. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So what’s the story with you and Nico?” I asked her. “Where did you go to
                        school before
                        Westover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She frowned. “I think it was a boarding school in D.C. It seems like so long
                        ago.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You never lived with your parents? I mean, your mortal parent?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We were told our parents were dead. There was a bank trust for us. A lot of
                        money, I think. A
                        lawyer would come by once in a while to check on us. Then Nico and I had to leave that school.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She knit her eyebrows. “We had to go somewhere. I remember it was important. We
                        traveled a long
                        way. And we stayed in this hotel for a few weeks. And then…I don’t know. One day a different
                        lawyer came to get
                        us out. He said it was time for us to leave. He drove us back east, through D.C. Then up into
                        Maine. And we
                        started going to Westover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was a strange story. Then again, Bianca and Nico were half-bloods. Nothing
                        would be normal
                        for them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So you’ve been raising Nico pretty much all your life?” I asked. “Just the two
                        of you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She nodded. “That’s why I wanted to join the Hunters so bad. I mean, I know
                        it’s selfish, but I
                        wanted my own life and friends. I love Nico—don’t get me wrong—I just needed to find out what it
                        would be like
                        not to be a big sister twenty-four hours a day.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought about last summer, the way I’d felt when I found out I had a Cyclops
                        for a baby
                        brother. I could relate to what Bianca was saying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zoë seems to trust you,” I said. “What were you guys talking about,
                        anyway—something dangerous
                        about the quest?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“When?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yesterday morning on the pavilion,” I said, before I could stop myself.
                        “Something about the
                        General.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her face darkened. “How did you…The invisibility hat. Were you eavesdropping?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No! I mean, not really. I just—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was saved from trying to explain when Zoë and Grover arrived with the drinks
                        and pastries.
                        Hot chocolate for Bianca and me. Coffee for them. I got a blueberry muffin, and it was so good I
                        could almost
                        ignore the outraged look Bianca was giving me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We should do the tracking spell,” Zoë said. “Grover, do you have any acorns
                        left?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Umm,” Grover mumbled. He was chewing on a bran muffin, wrapper and all. “I
                        think so. I just
                        need to—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He froze. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was about to ask what was wrong, when a warm breeze rustled past, like a gust
                        of springtime
                        had gotten lost in the middle of winter. Fresh air seasoned with wildflowers and sunshine. And
                        something
                        else—almost like a voice, trying to say something. A warning. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë gasped. “Grover, thy cup.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover dropped his coffee cup, which was decorated with pictures of birds.
                        Suddenly the birds
                        peeled off the cup and flew away—a flock of tiny doves. My rubber rat squeaked. It scampered off
                        the railing and
                        into the trees—real fur, real whiskers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover collapsed next to his coffee, which steamed against the snow. We
                        gathered around him and
                        tried to wake him up. He groaned, his eyes fluttering. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” Thalia said, running up from the street. “I just…What’s wrong with
                        Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t know,” I said. “He collapsed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uuuuuhhhh,” Grover groaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, get him up!” Thalia said. She had her spear in her hand. She looked
                        behind her as if she
                        were being followed. “We have to get out of here.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">We made it to the edge of the town before the first two skeleton warriors
                        appeared. They
                        stepped from the trees on either side of the road. Instead of gray camouflage, they were now
                        wearing blue New
                        Mexico State Police uniforms, but they had the same transparent gray skin and yellow eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They drew their handguns. I’ll admit I used to think it would be kind of cool
                        to learn how to
                        shoot a gun, but I changed my mind as soon as the skeleton warriors pointed theirs at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia tapped her bracelet. Aegis spiraled to life on her arm, but the warriors
                        didn’t flinch.
                        Their glowing yellow eyes bored right into me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I drew Riptide, though I wasn’t sure what good it would do against guns. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë and Bianca drew their bows, but Bianca was having trouble because Grover
                        kept swooning and
                        leaning against her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Back up,” Thalia said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We started to—but then I heard a rustling of branches. Two more skeletons
                        appeared on the road
                        behind us. We were surrounded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wondered where the other skeletons were. I’d seen a dozen at the Smithsonian.
                        Then one of the
                        warriors raised a cell phone to his mouth and spoke into it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Except he wasn’t speaking. He made a clattering, clicking sound, like dry teeth
                        on bone.
                        Suddenly I understood what was going on. The skeletons had split up to look for us. These
                        skeletons were now
                        calling their brethren. Soon we’d have a full party on our hands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s near,” Grover moaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s here,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” he insisted. “The gift. The gift from the Wild.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know what he was talking about, but I was worried about his condition.
                        He was in no
                        shape to walk, much less fight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll have to go one-on-one,” Thalia said. “Four of them. Four of us. Maybe
                        they’ll ignore
                        Grover that way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Agreed,” said Zoë. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Wild!” Grover moaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A warm wind blew through the canyon, rustling the trees, but I kept my eyes on
                        the skeletons. I
                        remembered the General gloating over Annabeth’s fate. I remembered the way Luke had betrayed
                        her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And I charged. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The first skeleton fired. Time slowed down. I won’t say I could see the bullet,
                        but I could
                        feel its path, the same way I felt water currents in the ocean. I deflected it off the edge of
                        my blade and kept
                        charging. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The skeleton drew a baton and I sliced off his arms at the elbows. Then I swung
                        Riptide through
                        his waist and cut him in half. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His bones unknit and clattered to the asphalt in a heap. Almost immediately,
                        they began to
                        move, reassembling themselves. The second skeleton clattered his teeth at me and tried to fire,
                        but I knocked
                        his gun into the snow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought I was doing pretty well, until the other two skeletons shot me in the
                        back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Thalia screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I landed facedown in the street. Then I realized something…I wasn’t dead. The
                        impact of the
                        bullets had been dull, like a push from behind, but they hadn’t hurt me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Nemean Lion’s fur! My coat was bulletproof. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia charged the second skeleton. Zoë and Bianca started firing arrows at the
                        third and
                        fourth. Grover stood there and held his hands out to the trees, looking like he wanted to hug
                        them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a crashing sound in the forest to our left, like a bulldozer. Maybe
                        the skeletons’
                        reinforcements were arriving. I got to my feet and ducked a police baton. The skeleton I’d cut
                        in half was
                        already fully re-formed, coming after me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was no way to stop them. Zoë and Bianca fired at their heads point-blank,
                        but the arrows
                        just whistled straight through their empty skulls. One lunged at Bianca, and I thought she was a
                        goner, but she
                        whipped out her hunting knife and stabbed the warrior in the chest. The whole skeleton erupted
                        into flames,
                        leaving a little pile of ashes and a police badge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How did you do that?” Zoë asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t know,” Bianca said nervously. “Lucky stab?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, do it again!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca tried, but the remaining three skeletons were wary of her now. They
                        pressed us back,
                        keeping us at baton’s length. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Plan?” I said as we retreated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nobody answered. The trees behind the skeletons were shivering. Branches were
                        cracking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A gift,” Grover muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And then, with a mighty roar, the largest pig I’d ever seen came crashing into
                        the road. It was
                        a wild boar, thirty feet high, with a snotty pink snout and tusks the size of canoes. Its back
                        bristled with
                        brown hair, and its eyes were wild and angry. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“REEEEEEEEET!” </i>it squealed, and raked the three
                        skeletons aside with
                        its tusks. The force was so great, they went flying over the trees and into the side of the
                        mountain, where they
                        smashed to pieces, thigh bones and arm bones twirling everywhere. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then the pig turned on us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia raised her spear, but Grover yelled, “Don’t kill it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The boar grunted and pawed the ground, ready to charge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s the Erymanthian Boar,” Zoë said, trying to stay calm. “I don’t think we
                        <i class="calibre5">can </i>kill it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s a gift,” Grover said. “A blessing from the Wild!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The boar said <i class="calibre5">“REEEEEET!” </i>and swung its tusk. Zoë and
                        Bianca dived out
                        of the way. I had to push Grover so he wouldn’t get launched into the mountain on the Boar Tusk
                        Express. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, I feel blessed!” I said. “Scatter!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We ran in different directions, and for a moment the boar was confused. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It wants to kill us!” Thalia said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Of course,” Grover said. “It’s wild!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So how is that a blessing?” Bianca asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It seemed a fair question to me, but the pig was offended and charged her. She
                        was faster than
                        I’d realized. She rolled out of the way of its hooves and came up behind the beast. It lashed
                        out with its tusks
                        and pulverized the <small class="calibre4">WELCOME TO CLOUDCROFT</small> sign. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I racked my brain, trying to remember the myth of the boar. I was pretty sure
                        Hercules had
                        fought this thing once, but I couldn’t remember how he’d beaten it. I had a vague memory of the
                        boar plowing
                        down several Greek cities before Hercules managed to subdue it. I hoped Cloudcroft was insured
                        against giant
                        wild boar attacks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Keep moving!” Zoë yelled. She and Bianca ran in opposite directions. Grover
                        danced around the
                        boar, playing his pipes while the boar snorted and tried to gouge him. But Thalia and I won the
                        prize for bad
                        luck. When the boar turned on us, Thalia made the mistake of raising Aegis in defense. The sight
                        of the Medusa
                        head made the boar squeal in outrage. Maybe it looked too much like one of his relatives. The
                        boar charged us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We only managed to keep ahead of it because we ran uphill, and we could dodge
                        in and out of
                        trees while the boar had to plow through them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">On the other side of the hill, I found an old stretch of train tracks, half
                        buried in the snow.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This way!” I grabbed Thalia’s arm and we ran along the rails while the boar
                        roared behind us,
                        slipping and sliding as it tried to navigate the steep hillside. Its hooves just were not made
                        for this, thank
                        the gods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Ahead of us, I saw a covered tunnel. Past that, an old trestle bridge spanning
                        a gorge. I had a
                        crazy idea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Follow me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia slowed down—I didn’t have time to ask why—but I pulled her along and she
                        reluctantly
                        followed. Behind us, a ten-ton pig tank was knocking down pine trees and crushing boulders under
                        its hooves as
                        it chased us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia and I ran into the tunnel and came out on the other side. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Thalia screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She’d turned as white as ice. We were at the edge of the bridge. Below, the
                        mountain dropped
                        away into a snow-filled gorge about seventy feet below. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The boar was right behind us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come on!” I said. “It’ll hold our weight, probably.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I can’t!” Thalia yelled. Her eyes were wild with fear. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The boar smashed into the covered tunnel, tearing through at full speed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now!” I yelled at Thalia. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked down and swallowed. I swear she was turning green. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t have time to process why. The boar was charging through the tunnel,
                        straight toward
                        us. Plan B. I tackled Thalia and sent us both sideways off the edge of the bridge, into the side
                        of the
                        mountain. We slid on Aegis like a snowboard, over rocks and mud and snow, racing downhill. The
                        boar was less
                        fortunate; it couldn’t turn that fast, so all ten tons of the monster charged out onto the tiny
                        trestle, which
                        buckled under its weight. The boar free-fell into the gorge with a mighty squeal and landed in a
                        snowdrift with
                        a huge <i class="calibre5">POOOOOF! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia and I skidded to a stop. We were both breathing hard. I was cut up and
                        bleeding. Thalia
                        had pine needles in her hair. Next to us, the wild boar was squealing and struggling. All I
                        could see was the
                        bristly tip of its back. It was wedged completely in the snow like Styrofoam packing. It didn’t
                        seem to be hurt,
                        but it wasn’t going anywhere, either. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at Thalia. “You’re afraid of heights.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Now that we were safely down the mountain, her eyes had their usual angry look.
                        “Don’t be
                        stupid.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That explains why you freaked out on Apollo’s bus. Why you didn’t want to talk
                        about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She took a deep breath. Then she brushed the pine needles out of her hair. “If
                        you tell anyone,
                        I swear—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no,” I said. “That’s cool. It’s just…the daughter of Zeus, the Lord of the
                        Sky, afraid of
                        heights?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She was about to knock me into the snow when, above us, Grover’s voice called,
                        “Helloooooo?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Down here!” I shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A few minutes later, Zoë, Bianca, and Grover joined us. We stood watching the
                        wild boar
                        struggle in the snow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A blessing of the Wild,” Grover said, though he now looked agitated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I agree,” Zoë said. “We must use it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hold up,” Thalia said irritably. She still looked like she’d just lost a fight
                        with a
                        Christmas tree. “Explain to me why you’re so sure this pig is a blessing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked over, distracted. “It’s our ride west. Do you have any idea how
                        fast this boar
                        can travel?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Fun,” I said. “Like…pig cowboys.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover nodded. “We need to get aboard. I wish…I wish I had more time to look
                        around. But it’s
                        gone now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What’s gone?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover didn’t seem to hear me. He walked over to the boar and jumped onto its
                        back. Already the
                        boar was starting to make some headway through the drift. Once it broke free, there’d be no
                        stopping it. Grover
                        took out his pipes. He started playing a snappy tune and tossed an apple in front of the boar.
                        The apple floated
                        and spun right above the boar’s nose, and the boar went nuts, straining to get it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Automatic steering,” Thalia murmured. “Great.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She trudged over and jumped on behind Grover, which still left plenty of room
                        for the rest of
                        us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë and Bianca walked toward the boar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait a second,” I said. “Do you two know what Grover is talking about—this
