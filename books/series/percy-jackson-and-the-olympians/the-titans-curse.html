                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The Friday before winter break, my mom packed me an overnight bag and a few
                        deadly weapons and
                        took me to a new boarding school. We picked up my friends Annabeth and Thalia on the way. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was an eight-hour drive from New York to Bar Harbor, Maine. Sleet and snow
                        pounded the
                        highway. Annabeth, Thalia, and I hadn’t seen each other in months, but between the blizzard and
                        the thought of
                        what we were about to do, we were too nervous to talk much. Except for my mom. She talks <i
                            class="calibre5">more </i>when she’s nervous. By the time we finally got to Westover Hall,
                        it was getting
                        dark, and she’d told Annabeth and Thalia every embarrassing baby story there was to tell about
                        me. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia wiped the fog off the car window and peered outside. “Oh, yeah. This’ll
                        be fun.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Westover Hall looked like an evil knight’s castle. It was all black stone, with
                        towers and slit
                        windows and a big set of wooden double doors. It stood on a snowy cliff overlooking this big
                        frosty forest on
                        one side and the gray churning ocean on the other. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Are you sure you don’t want me to wait?” my mother asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, thanks, Mom,” I said. “I don’t know how long it will take. We’ll be okay.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But how will you get back? I’m worried, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hoped I wasn’t blushing. It was bad enough I had to depend on my mom to drive
                        me to my
                        battles. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s okay, Ms. Jackson.” Annabeth smiled reassuringly. Her blond hair was
                        tucked into a ski
                        cap and her gray eyes were the same color as the ocean. “We’ll keep him out of trouble.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mom seemed to relax a little. She thinks Annabeth is the most levelheaded
                        demigod ever to
                        hit eighth grade. She’s sure Annabeth often keeps me from getting killed. She’s right, but that
                        doesn’t mean I
                        have to like it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right, dears,” my mom said. “Do you have everything you need?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, Ms. Jackson,” Thalia said. “Thanks for the ride.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Extra sweaters? You have my cell phone number?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mom—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Your ambrosia and nectar, Percy? And a golden drachma in case you need to
                        contact camp?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mom, seriously! We’ll be fine. Come on, guys.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked a little hurt, and I was sorry about that, but I was ready to be out
                        of that car. If
                        my mom told one more story about how cute I looked in the bathtub when I was three years old, I
                        was going to
                        burrow into the snow and freeze myself to death. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and Thalia followed me outside. The wind blew straight through my coat
                        like ice
                        daggers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Once my mother’s car was out of sight, Thalia said, “Your mom is so cool,
                        Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“She’s pretty okay,” I admitted. “What about you? You ever get in touch with
                        your mom?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As soon as I said it, I wished I hadn’t. Thalia was great at giving evil looks,
                        what with the
                        punk clothes she always wears—the ripped-up army jacket, black leather pants and chain jewelry,
                        the black
                        eyeliner and those intense blue eyes. But the look she gave me now was a perfect evil “ten.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“If that was any of your business, Percy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’d better get inside,” Annabeth interrupted. “Grover will be waiting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia looked at the castle and shivered. “You’re right. I wonder what he found
                        here that made
                        him send the distress call.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared up at the dark towers of Westover Hall. “Nothing good,” I guessed.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The oak doors groaned open, and the three of us stepped into the entry hall in
                        a swirl of snow.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">All I could say was, “Whoa.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The place was huge. The walls were lined with battle flags and weapon displays:
                        antique rifles,
                        battle axes, and a bunch of other stuff. I mean, I knew Westover was a military school and all,
                        but the
                        decorations seemed like overkill. Literally. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My hand went to my pocket, where I kept my lethal ballpoint pen, Riptide. I
                        could already sense
                        something wrong in this place. Something dangerous. Thalia was rubbing her silver bracelet, her
                        favorite magic
                        item. I knew we were thinking the same thing. A fight was coming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth started to say, “I wonder where—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The doors slammed shut behind us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oo-kay,” I mumbled. “Guess we’ll stay a while.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I could hear music echoing from the other end of the hall. It sounded like
                        dance music. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We stashed our overnight bags behind a pillar and started down the hall. We
                        hadn’t gone very
                        far when I heard footsteps on the stone floor, and a man and woman marched out of the shadows to
                        intercept us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They both had short gray hair and black military-style uniforms with red trim.
                        The woman had a
                        wispy mustache, and the guy was clean-shaven, which seemed kind of backward to me. They both
                        walked stiffly,
                        like they had broomsticks taped to their spines. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well?” the woman demanded. “What are you doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um…” I realized I hadn’t planned for this. I’d been so focused on getting to
                        Grover and
                        finding out what was wrong, I hadn’t considered that someone might question three kids sneaking
                        into the school
                        at night. We hadn’t talked at all in the car about how we would get inside. I said, “Ma’am,
                        we’re just—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ha!” the man snapped, which made me jump. “Visitors are not allowed at the
                        dance! You shall be
                        <i class="calibre5">eee-jected</i>!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He had an accent—French, maybe. He pronounced his <i class="calibre5">J
                        </i>like in <i class="calibre5">Jacques</i>. He was tall, with a hawkish face. His nostrils
                        flared when he spoke, which
                        made it really hard not to stare up his nose, and his eyes were two different colors—one brown,
                        one blue—like an
                        alley cat’s. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I figured he was about to toss us into the snow, but then Thalia stepped
                        forward and did
                        something very weird. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She snapped her fingers. The sound was sharp and loud. Maybe it was just my
                        imagination, but I
                        felt a gust of wind ripple out from her hand, across the room. It washed over all of us, making
                        the banners
                        rustle on the walls. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, but we’re not visitors, sir,” Thalia said. “We go to school here. You
                        remember: I’m
                        Thalia. And this is Annabeth and Percy. We’re in the eighth grade.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The male teacher narrowed his two-colored eyes. I didn’t know what Thalia was
                        thinking. Now
                        we’d probably get punished for lying <i class="calibre5">and </i>thrown into the snow. But the
                        man seemed to be
                        hesitating. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked at his colleague. “Ms. Gottschalk, do you know these students?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Despite the danger we were in, I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. A
                        teacher named
                        <i class="calibre5">Got Chalk</i>? He had to be kidding.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The woman blinked, like someone had just woken her up from a trance. “I…yes. I
                        believe I do,
                        sir.” She frowned at us. “Annabeth. Thalia. Percy. What are you doing away from the gymnasium?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before we could answer, I heard more footsteps, and Grover ran up, breathless.
                        “You made it!
                        You—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He stopped short when he saw the teachers. “Oh, Mrs. Gottschalk. Dr. Thorn! I,
                        uh—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What <i class="calibre5">is </i>it, Mr. Underwood?” said the man. His tone
                        made it clear that
                        he detested Grover. “What do you mean, they made it? These students live here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover swallowed. “Yes, sir. Of course, Dr. Thorn. I just meant, I’m so glad
                        they made…the
                        punch for the dance! The punch is great. And they made it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn glared at us. I decided one of his eyes had to be fake. The brown
                        one? The blue one?
                        He looked like he wanted to pitch us off the castle’s highest tower, but then Mrs. Gottschalk
                        said dreamily,
                        “Yes, the punch is excellent. Now run along, all of you. You are not to leave the gymnasium
                        again!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We didn’t wait to be told twice. We left with a lot of “Yes, ma’ams” and “Yes,
                        sirs” and a
                        couple of salutes, just because it seemed like the thing to do. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover hustled us down the hall in the direction of the music. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I could feel the teachers’ eyes on my back, but I walked closely to Thalia and
                        asked in a low
                        voice, “How did you do that finger-snap thing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You mean the Mist? Hasn’t Chiron shown you how to do that yet?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">An uncomfortable lump formed in my throat. Chiron was our head trainer at camp,
                        but he’d never
                        shown me anything like that. Why had he shown Thalia and not me? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover hurried us to a door that had <small class="calibre4">GYM</small>
                        written on the glass.
                        Even with my dyslexia, I could read that much. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That was close!” Grover said. “Thank the gods you got here!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and Thalia both hugged Grover. I gave him a big high five. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was good to see him after so many months. He’d gotten a little taller and
                        had sprouted a few
                        more whiskers, but otherwise he looked like he always did when he passed for human—a red cap on
                        his curly brown
                        hair to hide his goat horns, baggy jeans and sneakers with fake feet to hide his furry legs and
                        hooves. He was
                        wearing a black T-shirt that took me a few seconds to read. It said <small
                            class="calibre4">WESTOVER HALL:
                            GRUNT</small>. I wasn’t sure whether that was, like, Grover’s rank or maybe just the school
                        motto. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“So what’s the emergency?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover took a deep breath. “I found two.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Two half-bloods?” Thalia asked, amazed. “Here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finding one half-blood was rare enough. This year, Chiron had put the satyrs on
                        emergency
                        overtime and sent them all over the country, scouring schools from fourth grade through high
                        school for possible
                        recruits. These were desperate times. We were losing campers. We needed all the new fighters we
                        could find. The
                        problem was, there just weren’t that many demigods out there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A brother and a sister,” he said. “They’re ten and twelve. I don’t know their
                        parentage, but
                        they’re strong. We’re running out of time, though. I need help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Monsters?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“One.” Grover looked nervous. “He suspects. I don’t think he’s positive yet,
                        but this is the
                        last day of term. I’m sure he won’t let them leave campus without finding out. It may be our
                        last chance! Every
                        time I try to get close to them, he’s always there, blocking me. I don’t know what to do!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked at Thalia desperately. I tried not to feel upset by that. Used to
                        be, Grover
                        looked to me for answers, but Thalia had seniority. Not just because her dad was Zeus. Thalia
                        had more
                        experience than any of us with fending off monsters in the real world. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right,” she said. “These half-bloods are at the dance?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then let’s dance,” Thalia said. “Who’s the monster?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh,” Grover said, and looked around nervously. “You just met him. The vice
                        principal, Dr.
                        Thorn.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Weird thing about military schools: the kids go absolutely nuts when there’s a
                        special event
                        and they get to be out of uniform. I guess it’s because everything’s so strict the rest of the
                        time, they feel
                        like they’ve got to overcompensate or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There were black and red balloons all over the gym floor, and guys were kicking
                        them in each
                        other’s faces, or trying to strangle each other with the crepe-paper streamers taped to the
                        walls. Girls moved
                        around in football huddles, the way they always do, wearing lots of makeup and spaghetti-strap
                        tops and brightly
                        colored pants and shoes that looked like torture devices. Every once in a while they’d surround
                        some poor guy
                        like a pack of piranhas, shrieking and giggling, and when they finally moved on, the guy would
                        have ribbons in
                        his hair and a bunch of lipstick graffiti all over his face. Some of the older guys looked more
                        like
                        me—uncomfortable, hanging out at the edges of the gym and trying to hide, like any minute they
                        might have to
                        fight for their lives. Of course, in my case, it was true.…</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There they are.” Grover nodded toward a couple of younger kids arguing in the
                        bleachers.
                        “Bianca and Nico di Angelo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The girl wore a floppy green cap, like she was trying to hide her face. The boy
                        was obviously
                        her little brother. They both had dark silky hair and olive skin, and they used their hands a
                        lot as they
                        talked. The boy was shuffling some kind of trading cards. His sister seemed to be scolding him
                        about something.
                        She kept looking around like she sensed something was wrong. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth said, “Do they…I mean, have you told them?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover shook his head. “You know how it is. That could put them in more danger.
                        Once they
                        realize who they are, their scent becomes stronger.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked at me, and I nodded. I’d never really understood what half-bloods
                        “smell” like to
                        monsters and satyrs, but I knew that your scent could get you killed. And the more powerful a
                        demigod you
                        became, the more you smelled like a monster’s lunch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So let’s grab them and get out of here,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I started forward, but Thalia put her hand on my shoulder. The vice principal,
                        Dr. Thorn, had
                        slipped out of a doorway near the bleachers and was standing near the di Angelo siblings. He
                        nodded coldly in
                        our direction. His blue eye seemed to glow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Judging from his expression, I guessed Thorn hadn’t been fooled by Thalia’s
                        trick with the Mist
                        after all. He suspected who we were. He was just waiting to see why we were here. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t look at the kids,” Thalia ordered. “We have to wait for a chance to get
                        them. We need to
                        pretend we’re not interested in them. Throw him off the scent.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’re three powerful half-bloods. Our presence should confuse him. Mingle. Act
                        natural. Do
                        some dancing. But keep an eye on those kids.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dancing?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia nodded. She cocked her ear to the music and made a face. “Ugh. Who chose
                        the Jesse
                        McCartney?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked hurt. “I did.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh my gods, Grover. That is so lame. Can’t you play, like, Green Day or
                        something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Green who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Never mind. Let’s dance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But I can’t dance!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You can if I’m leading,” Thalia said. “Come on, goat boy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover yelped as Thalia grabbed his hand and led him onto the dance floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth smiled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nothing. It’s just cool to have Thalia back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth had grown taller than me since last summer, which I found kind of
                        disturbing. She used
                        to wear no jewelry except for her Camp Half-Blood bead necklace, but now she wore little silver
                        earrings shaped
                        like owls—the symbol of her mother, Athena. She pulled off her ski cap, and her long blond hair
                        tumbled down her
                        shoulders. It made her look older, for some reason. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So…” I tried to think of something to say. <i class="calibre5">Act
                            natural</i>, Thalia had
                        told us. When you’re a half-blood on a dangerous mission, what the heck is natural? “Um, design
                        any good
                        buildings lately?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth’s eyes lit up, the way they always did when she talked about
                        architecture. “Oh my
                        gods, Percy. At my new school, I get to take 3-D design as an elective, and there’s this cool
                        computer program…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She went on to explain how she’d designed this huge monument that she wanted to
                        build at Ground
                        Zero in Manhattan. She talked about structural supports and facades and stuff, and I tried to
                        listen. I knew she
                        wanted to be a super architect when she grew up—she loves math and historical buildings and all
                        that—but I
                        hardly understood a word she was saying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The truth was I was kind of disappointed to hear that she liked her new school
                        so much. It was
                        the first time she’d gone to school in New York. I’d been hoping to see her more often. It was a
                        boarding school
                        in Brooklyn, and she and Thalia were both attending, close enough to Camp Half-Blood that Chiron
                        could help if
                        they got in any trouble. Because it was an all-girls school, and I was going to MS-54 in
                        Manhattan, I hardly
                        ever saw them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, uh, cool,” I said. “So you’re staying there the rest of the year, huh?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her face got dark. “Well, maybe, if I don’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” Thalia called to us. She was slow dancing with Grover, who was tripping
                        all over
                        himself, kicking Thalia in the shins, and looking like he wanted to die. At least his feet were
                        fake. Unlike me,
                        he had an excuse for being clumsy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dance, you guys!” Thalia ordered. “You look stupid just standing there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked nervously at Annabeth, then at the groups of girls who were roaming
                        the gym. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well?” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, who should I ask?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She punched me in the gut. “<i class="calibre5">Me</i>, Seaweed Brain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh. Oh, right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">So we went onto the dance floor, and I looked over to see how Thalia and Grover
                        were doing
                        things. I put one hand on Annabeth’s hip, and she clasped my other hand like she was about to
                        judo throw me.
                    </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m not going to bite,” she told me. “Honestly, Percy. Don’t you guys have
                        dances at your
                        school?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t answer. The truth was we did. But I’d never, like, actually <i
                            class="calibre5">danced
                        </i>at one. I was usually one of the guys playing basketball in the corner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We shuffled around for a few minutes. I tried to concentrate on little things,
                        like the
                        crepe-paper streamers and the punch bowl—anything but the fact that Annabeth was taller than me,
                        and my hands
                        were sweaty and probably gross, and I kept stepping on her toes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What were you saying earlier?” I asked. “Are you having trouble at school or
                        something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pursed her lips. “It’s not that. It’s my dad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uh-oh.” I knew Annabeth had a rocky relationship with her father. “I thought
                        it was getting
                        better with you two. Is it your stepmom again?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth sighed. “He decided to move. Just when I was getting settled in New
                        York, he took this
                        stupid new job researching for a World War I book. In <i class="calibre5">San Francisco</i>.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She said this the same way she might say <i class="calibre5">Fields of
                            Punishment </i>or <i class="calibre5">Hades’s gym shorts</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So he wants you to move out there with him?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“To the other side of the country,” she said miserably. “And half-bloods can’t
                        live in San
                        Francisco. He should know that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What? Why not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth rolled her eyes. Maybe she thought I was kidding. “You know. It’s
                        right <i class="calibre5">there</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh,” I said. I had no idea what she was talking about, but I didn’t want to
                        sound stupid.
                        “So…you’ll go back to living at camp or what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s more serious than that, Percy. I…I probably should tell you something.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Suddenly she froze. “They’re gone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I followed her gaze. The bleachers. The two half-blood kids, Bianca and Nico,
                        were no longer
                        there. The door next to the bleachers was wide open. Dr. Thorn was nowhere in sight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We have to get Thalia and Grover!” Annabeth looked around frantically. “Oh,
                        where’d they dance
                        off to? Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She ran through the crowd. I was about to follow when a mob of girls got in my
                        way. I
                        maneuvered around them to avoid getting the ribbon-and-lipstick treatment, and by the time I was
                        free, Annabeth
                        had disappeared. I turned a full circle, looking for her or Thalia and Grover. Instead, I saw
                        something that
                        chilled my blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">About fifty feet away, lying on the gym floor, was a floppy green cap just like
                        the one Bianca
                        di Angelo had been wearing. Near it were a few scattered trading cards. Then I caught a glimpse
                        of Dr. Thorn. He
                        was hurrying out a door at the opposite end of the gym, steering the di Angelo kids by the
                        scruffs of their
                        necks, like kittens. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/1-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I still couldn’t see Annabeth, but I knew she’d be heading the other way,
                        looking for Thalia
                        and Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I almost ran after her, and then I thought, <i class="calibre5">Wait</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I remembered what Thalia had said to me in the entry hall, looking at me all
                        puzzled when I
                        asked about the finger-snap trick: <i class="calibre5">Hasn’t Chiron shown you how to do that
                            yet? </i>I thought
                        about the way Grover had turned to her, expecting her to save the day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Not that I resented Thalia. She was cool. It wasn’t her fault her dad was Zeus
                        and she got all
                        the attention.…Still, I didn’t need to run after her to solve every problem. Besides, there
                        wasn’t time. The di
                        Angelos were in danger. They might be long gone by the time I found my friends. I knew monsters.
                        I could handle
                        this myself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took Riptide out of my pocket and ran after Dr. Thorn.</p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The door led into a dark hallway. I heard sounds of scuffling up ahead, then a
                        painful grunt. I
                        uncapped Riptide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The pen grew in my hands until I held a bronze Greek sword about three-feet
                        long with a
                        leather-bound grip. The blade glowed faintly, casting a golden light on the rows of lockers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I jogged down the corridor, but when I got to the other end, no one was there.
                        I opened a door
                        and found myself back in the main entry hall. I was completely turned around. I didn’t see Dr.
                        Thorn anywhere,
                        but there on the opposite side of the room were the di Angelo kids. They stood frozen in horror,
                        staring right
                        at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I advanced slowly, lowering the tip of my sword. “It’s okay. I’m not going to
                        hurt you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They didn’t answer. Their eyes were full of fear. What was wrong with them?
                        Where was Dr.
                        Thorn? Maybe he’d sensed the presence of Riptide and retreated. Monsters hated celestial bronze
                        weapons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“My name’s Percy,” I said, trying to keep my voice level. “I’m going to take
                        you out of here,
                        get you somewhere safe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca’s eyes widened. Her fists clenched. Only too late did I realize what her
                        look meant. She
                        wasn’t afraid of me. She was trying to warn me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I whirled around and something went <i class="calibre5">WHIIISH! </i>Pain
                        exploded in my
                        shoulder. A force like a huge hand yanked me backward and slammed me to the wall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I slashed with my sword but there was nothing to hit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A cold laugh echoed through the hall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, Perseus <i class="calibre5">Jackson</i>,” Dr. Thorn said. His accent
                        mangled the <i class="calibre5">J </i>in my last name. “I know who you are.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to free my shoulder. My coat and shirt were pinned to the wall by some
                        kind of spike—a
                        black dagger-like projectile about a foot long. It had grazed the skin of my shoulder as it
                        passed through my
                        clothes, and the cut burned. I’d felt something like this before. Poison. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">I forced myself to concentrate. I would <i class="calibre5">not </i>pass out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A dark silhouette now moved toward us. Dr. Thorn stepped into the dim light. He
                        still looked
                        human, but his face was ghoulish. He had perfect white teeth and his brown/blue eyes reflected
                        the light of my
                        sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thank you for coming out of the gym,” he said. “I hate middle school dances.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to swing my sword again, but he was just out of reach. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">WHIIIISH! </i>A second projectile shot from somewhere
                        behind Dr. Thorn. He
                        didn’t appear to move. It was as if someone invisible were standing behind him, throwing knives.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Next to me, Bianca yelped. The second thorn impaled itself in the stone wall,
                        half an inch from
                        her face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All three of you will come with me,” Dr. Thorn said. “Quietly. Obediently. If
                        you make a
                        single noise, if you call out for help or try to fight, I will show you just how accurately I
                        can throw.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Maybe I could defend myself if I could get my shield activated. All that it
                        would take was a
                        touch of my wristwatch. But defending the di Angelo kids was another matter. I needed help, and
                        there was only
                        one way I could think to get it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I closed my eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What are you doing, Jackson?” hissed Dr. Thorn. “Keep moving!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I opened my eyes and kept shuffling forward. “It’s my shoulder,” I lied, trying
                        to sound
                        miserable, which wasn’t hard. “It burns.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bah! My poison causes pain. It will not kill you. Walk!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn herded us outside, and I tried to concentrate. I pictured Grover’s face.
                        I focused on my
                        feelings of fear and danger. Last summer, Grover had created an empathy link between us. He’d
                        sent me visions in
                        my dreams to let me know when he was in trouble. As far as I knew, we were still linked, but I’d
                        never tried to
                        contact Grover before. I didn’t even know if it would work while Grover was awake. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Hey, Grover! </i>I thought. <i class="calibre5">Thorn’s
                            kidnapping us! He’s
                            a poisonous spike-throwing maniac! Help! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn marched us into the woods. We took a snowy path dimly lit by
                        old-fashioned lamplights. My
                        shoulder ached. The wind blowing through my ripped clothes was so cold that I felt like a
                        Percysicle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There is a clearing ahead,” Thorn said. “We will summon your ride.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What ride?” Bianca demanded. “Where are you taking us?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Silence, you insufferable girl!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t talk to my sister that way!” Nico said. His voice quivered, but I was
                        impressed that he
                        had the guts to say anything at all. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn made a growling sound that definitely wasn’t human. It made the hairs
                        stand up on the
                        back of my neck, but I forced myself to keep walking and pretend I was being a good little
                        captive. Meanwhile, I
                        projected my thoughts like crazy—anything to get Grover’s attention: <i class="calibre5">Grover!

                    <p class="calibre13">“Halt,” Thorn said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The woods had opened up. We’d reached a cliff overlooking the sea. At least, I
                        <i class="calibre5">sensed </i>the sea was down there, hundreds of feet below. I could hear the
                        waves churning
                        and I could smell the cold salty froth. But all I could see was mist and darkness.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn pushed us toward the edge. I stumbled, and Bianca caught me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thanks,” I murmured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What <i class="calibre5">is </i>he?” she whispered. “How do we fight him?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I…I’m working on it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m scared,” Nico mumbled. He was fiddling with something—a little metal toy
                        soldier of some
                        kind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stop talking!” Dr. Thorn said. “Face me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We turned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn’s two-tone eyes glittered hungrily. He pulled something from under his
                        coat. At first I
                        thought it was a switchblade, but it was only a phone. He pressed the side button and said, “The
                        package—it is
                        ready to deliver.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a garbled reply, and I realized Thorn was in walkie-talkie mode. This
                        seemed way too
                        modern and creepy—a monster using a mobile phone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I glanced behind me, wondering how far the drop was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn laughed. “By all means, Son of Poseidon. <i class="calibre5">Jump!
                        </i>There is the
                        sea. Save yourself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What did he call you?” Bianca muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll explain later,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You do have a plan, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Grover! </i>I thought desperately. <i class="calibre5">Come
                            to me! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Maybe I could get both the di Angelos to jump with me into the ocean. If we
                        survived the fall,
                        I could use the water to protect us. I’d done things like that before. If my dad was in a good
                        mood, and
                        listening, he might help. Maybe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I would kill you before you ever reached the water,” Dr. Thorn said, as if
                        reading my
                        thoughts. “You do not realize who I am, do you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A flicker of movement behind him, and another missile whistled so close to me
                        that it nicked my
                        ear. Something had sprung up behind Dr. Thorn—like a catapult, but more flexible…almost like a
                        tail. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Unfortunately,” Thorn said, “you are wanted alive, if possible. Otherwise you
                        would already be
                        dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Who wants us?” Bianca demanded. “Because if you think you’ll get a ransom,
                        you’re wrong. We
                        don’t have any family. Nico and I…” Her voice broke a little. “We’ve got no one but each other.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Aww,” Dr. Thorn said. “Do not worry, little brats. You will be meeting my
                        employer soon
                        enough. Then you will have a brand-new family.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Luke,” I said. “You work for Luke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn’s mouth twisted with distaste when I said the name of my old enemy—a
                        former friend
                        who’d tried to kill me several times. “You have no idea what is happening, Perseus Jackson. I
                        will let the
                        General enlighten you. You are going to do him a great service tonight. He is looking forward to
                        meeting you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The General?” I asked. Then I realized I’d said it with a French accent. “I
                        mean…who’s the
                        General?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thorn looked toward the horizon. “Ah, here we are. Your transportation.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned and saw a light in the distance, a searchlight over the sea. Then I
                        heard the chopping
                        of helicopter blades getting louder and closer. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Where are you taking us?” Nico said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You should be honored, my boy. You will have the opportunity to join a great
                        army! Just like
                        that silly game you play with cards and dolls.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They’re not dolls! They’re figurines! And you can take your great army and—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now, now,” Dr. Thorn warned. “You will change your mind about joining us, my
                        boy. And if you
                        do not, well…there are other uses for half-bloods. We have many monstrous mouths to feed. The
                        Great Stirring is
                        underway.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Great what?” I asked. Anything to keep him talking while I tried to figure
                        out a plan.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The stirring of monsters.” Dr. Thorn smiled evilly. “The worst of them, the
                        most powerful, are
                        now waking. Monsters that have not been seen in thousands of years. They will cause death and
                        destruction the
                        likes of which mortals have never known. And soon we shall have the most important monster of
                        all—the one that
                        shall bring about the downfall of Olympus!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Okay,” Bianca whispered to me. “He’s completely nuts.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We have to jump off the cliff,” I told her quietly. “Into the sea.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, super idea. You’re completely nuts, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I never got the chance to argue with her, because just then an invisible force
                        slammed into me.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Looking back on it, Annabeth’s move was brilliant. Wearing her cap of
                        invisibility, she plowed
                        into the di Angelos and me, knocking us to the ground. For a split second, Dr. Thorn was taken
                        by surprise, so
                        his first volley of missiles zipped harmlessly over our heads. This gave Thalia and Grover a
                        chance to advance
                        from behind—Thalia wielding her magic shield, Aegis. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">If you’ve never seen Thalia run into battle, you have never been truly
                        frightened. She uses a
                        huge spear that expands from this collapsible Mace canister she carries in her pocket, but
                        that’s not the scary
                        part. Her shield is modeled after one her dad Zeus uses—also called Aegis—a gift from Athena.
                        The shield has the
                        head of the gorgon Medusa molded into the bronze, and even though it won’t turn you to stone,
                        it’s so horrible,
                        most people will panic and run at the sight of it. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/2-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Even Dr. Thorn winced and growled when he saw it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia moved in with her spear. “For Zeus!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought Dr. Thorn was a goner. Thalia jabbed at his head, but he snarled and
                        swatted the
                        spear aside. His hand changed into an orange paw, with enormous claws that sparked against
                        Thalia’s shield as he
                        slashed. If it hadn’t been for Aegis, Thalia would’ve been sliced like a loaf of bread. As it
                        was, she managed
                        to roll backward and land on her feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The sound of the helicopter was getting louder behind me, but I didn’t dare
                        look. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn launched another volley of missiles at Thalia, and this time I could
                        see how he did
                        it. He had a tail—a leathery, scorpionlike tail that bristled with spikes at the tip. The
                        missiles deflected off
                        Aegis, but the force of their impact knocked Thalia down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover sprang forward. He put his reed pipes to his lips and began to play—a
                        frantic jig that
                        sounded like something pirates would dance to. Grass broke through the snow. Within seconds,
                        rope-thick weeds
                        were wrapping around Dr. Thorn’s legs, entangling him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn roared and began to change. He grew larger until he was in his true
                        form—his face
                        still human, but his body that of a huge lion. His leathery, spiky tail whipped deadly thorns in
                        all directions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A manticore!” Annabeth said, now visible. Her magical New York Yankees cap had
                        come off when
                        she’d plowed into us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Who <i class="calibre5">are </i>you people?” Bianca di Angelo demanded. “And
                        what is <i class="calibre5">that</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A manticore?” Nico gasped. “He’s got three thousand attack power and plus five
                        to saving
                        throws!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t know what he was talking about, but I didn’t have time to worry about
                        it. The
                        manticore clawed Grover’s magic weeds to shreds then turned toward us with a snarl. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/2-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get down!” Annabeth pushed the di Angelos flat into the snow. At the last
                        second, I remembered
                        my own shield. I hit my wristwatch, and metal plating spiraled out into a thick bronze shield.
                        Not a moment too
                        soon. The thorns impacted against it with such force they dented the metal. The beautiful
                        shield, a gift from my
                        brother, was badly damaged. I wasn’t sure it would even stop a second volley. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I heard a <i class="calibre5">thwack </i>and a yelp, and Grover landed next to
                        me with a thud.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yield!” the monster roared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Never!” Thalia yelled from across the field. She charged the monster, and for
                        a second, I
                        thought she would run him through. But then there was a thunderous noise and a blaze of light
                        from behind us.
                        The helicopter appeared out of the mist, hovering just beyond the cliffs. It was a sleek black
                        military-style
                        gunship, with attachments on the sides that looked like laser-guided rockets. The helicopter had
                        to be manned by
                        mortals, but what was it doing here? How could mortals be working with a monster? The
                        searchlights blinded
                        Thalia, and the manticore swatted her away with its tail. Her shield flew off into the snow. Her
                        spear flew in
                        the other direction. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” I ran out to help her. I parried away a spike just before it would’ve hit
                        her chest. I
                        raised my shield over us, but I knew it wouldn’t be enough. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn laughed. “Now do you see how hopeless it is? Yield, little heroes.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were trapped between a monster and a fully armed helicopter. We had no
                        chance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I heard a clear, piercing sound: the call of a hunting horn blowing in the
                        woods. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The manticore froze. For a moment, no one moved. There was only the swirl of
                        snow and wind and
                        the chopping of the helicopter blades. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” Dr. Thorn said. “It cannot be—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His sentence was cut short when something shot past me like a streak of
                        moonlight. A glowing
                        silver arrow sprouted from Dr. Thorn’s shoulder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He staggered backward, wailing in agony. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Curse you!” Thorn cried. He unleashed his spikes, dozens of them at once, into
                        the woods where
                        the arrow had come from, but just as fast, silvery arrows shot back in reply. It almost looked
                        like the arrows
                        had intercepted the thorns in midair and sliced them in two, but my eyes must’ve been playing
                        tricks on me. No
                        one, not even Apollo’s kids at camp, could shoot with that much accuracy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The manticore pulled the arrow out of his shoulder with a howl of pain. His
                        breathing was
                        heavy. I tried to swipe at him with my sword, but he wasn’t as injured as he looked. He dodged
                        my attack and
                        slammed his tail into my shield, knocking me aside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then the archers came from the woods. They were girls, about a dozen of them.
                        The youngest was
                        maybe ten. The oldest, about fourteen, like me. They wore silvery ski parkas and jeans, and they
                        were all armed
                        with bows. They advanced on the manticore with determined expressions. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Hunters!” Annabeth cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Next to me, Thalia muttered, “Oh, wonderful.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t have a chance to ask what she meant. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">One of the older archers stepped forward with her bow drawn. She was tall and
                        graceful with
                        coppery colored skin. Unlike the other girls, she had a silver circlet braided into the top of
                        her long dark
                        hair, so she looked like some kind of Persian princess. “Permission to kill, my lady?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/2-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t tell who she was talking to, because she kept her eyes on the
                        manticore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The monster wailed. “This is not fair! Direct interference! It is against the
                        Ancient Laws.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not so,” another girl said. This one was a little younger than me, maybe
                        twelve or thirteen.
                        She had auburn hair gathered back in a ponytail and strange eyes, silvery yellow like the moon.
                        Her face was so
                        beautiful it made me catch my breath, but her expression was stern and dangerous. “The hunting
                        of all wild
                        beasts is within my sphere. And you, foul creature, are a wild beast.” She looked at the older
                        girl with the
                        circlet. “Zoë, permission granted.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The manticore growled. “If I cannot have these alive, I shall have them dead!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He lunged at Thalia and me, knowing we were weak and dazed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Annabeth yelled, and she charged at the monster. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get back, half-blood!” the girl with the circlet said. “Get out of the line of
                        fire!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But Annabeth leaped onto the monster’s back and drove her knife into his mane.
                        The manticore
                        howled, turning in circles with his tail flailing as Annabeth hung on for dear life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Fire!” Zoë ordered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” I screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But the Hunters let their arrows fly. The first caught the manticore in the
                        neck. Another hit
                        his chest. The manticore staggered backward, wailing, “This is not the end, Huntress! You shall
                        pay!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And before anyone could react, the monster, with Annabeth still on his back,
                        leaped over the
                        cliff and tumbled into the darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I started to run after her, but our enemies weren’t done with us. There was a
                        <i class="calibre5">snap-snap-snap </i>from the helicopter—the sound of gunfire.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Most of the Hunters scattered as tiny holes appeared in the snow at their feet,
                        but the girl
                        with auburn hair just looked up calmly at the helicopter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mortals,” she announced, “are not allowed to witness my hunt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She thrust out her hand, and the helicopter exploded into dust—no, not dust.
                        The black metal
                        dissolved into a flock of birds—ravens, which scattered into the night. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/2-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The Hunters advanced on us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The one called Zoë stopped short when she saw Thalia. “You,” she said with
                        distaste. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zoë Nightshade.” Thalia’s voice trembled with anger. “Perfect timing, as
                        usual.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë scanned the rest of us. “Four half-bloods and a satyr, my lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes,” the younger girl said. “Some of Chiron’s campers, I see.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth!” I yelled. “You have to let us save her!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The auburn-haired girl turned toward me. “I’m sorry, Percy Jackson, but your
                        friend is beyond
                        help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to struggle to my feet, but a couple of the girls held me down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You are in no condition to be hurling yourself off cliffs,” the auburn-haired
                        girl said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Let me go!” I demanded. “Who do you think you are?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë stepped forward as if to smack me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” the other girl ordered. “I sense no disrespect, Zoë. He is simply
                        distraught. He does not
                        understand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The young girl looked at me, her eyes colder and brighter than the winter moon.
                        “I am Artemis,”
                        she said. “Goddess of the Hunt.” </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">After seeing Dr. Thorn turn into a monster and plummet off the edge of a cliff
                        with Annabeth,
                        you’d think nothing else could shock me. But when this twelve-year-old girl told me she was the
                        goddess Artemis,
                        I said something real intelligent like, “Um…okay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That was nothing compared to Grover. He gasped, then knelt hastily in the snow
                        and started
                        yammering, “Thank you, Lady Artemis! You’re so…you’re so…Wow!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Get up, goat boy!” Thalia snapped. “We have other things to worry about.
                        Annabeth is gone!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whoa,” Bianca di Angelo said. “Hold up. Time out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everybody looked at her. She pointed her finger at all of us in turn, like she
                        was trying to
                        connect the dots. “Who…who are you people?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis’s expression softened. “It might be a better question, my dear girl, to
                        ask who are <i class="calibre5">you</i>? Who are your parents?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca glanced nervously at her brother, who was still staring in awe at
                        Artemis. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Our parents are dead,” Bianca said. “We’re orphans. There’s a bank trust that
                        pays for our
                        school, but…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She faltered. I guess she could tell from our faces that we didn’t believe her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” she demanded. “I’m telling the truth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You are a half-blood,” Zoë Nightshade said. Her accent was hard to place. It
                        sounded
                        old-fashioned, like she was reading from a really old book. “One of thy parents was mortal. The
                        other was an
                        Olympian.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“An Olympian…athlete?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No,” Zoë said. “One of the gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cool!” said Nico. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” Bianca’s voice quavered. “This is not cool!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico danced around like he needed to use the restroom. “Does Zeus really have
                        lightning bolts
                        that do six hundred damage? Does he get extra movement points for—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nico, shut up!” Bianca put her hands to her face. “This is not your stupid
                        Mythomagic game,
                        okay? There are no gods!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As anxious as I felt about Annabeth—all I wanted to do was search for her—I
                        couldn’t help
                        feeling sorry for the di Angelos. I remembered what it was like for me when I first learned I
                        was a demigod.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia must’ve been feeling something similar, because the anger in her eyes
                        subsided a little
                        bit. “Bianca, I know it’s hard to believe. But the gods are still around. Trust me. They’re
                        immortal. And
                        whenever they have kids with regular humans, kids like us, well…Our lives are dangerous.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dangerous,” Bianca said, “like the girl who fell.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia turned away. Even Artemis looked pained. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Do not despair for Annabeth,” the goddess said. “She was a brave maiden. If
                        she can be found,
                        I shall find her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then why won’t you let us go look for her?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“She is gone. Can’t you sense it, Son of Poseidon? Some magic is at work. I do
                        not know exactly
                        how or why, but your friend has vanished.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I still wanted to jump off the cliff and search for her, but I had a feeling
                        that Artemis was
                        right. Annabeth was gone. If she’d been down there in the sea, I thought, I’d be able to feel
                        her presence. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oo!” Nico raised his hand. “What about Dr. Thorn? That was awesome how you
                        shot him with
                        arrows! Is he dead?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He was a manticore,” Artemis said. “Hopefully he is destroyed for now, but
                        monsters never
                        truly die. They re-form over and over again, and they must be hunted whenever they reappear.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Or they’ll hunt us,” Thalia said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca di Angelo shivered. “That explains…Nico, you remember last summer, those
                        guys who tried
                        to attack us in the alley in D.C.?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And that bus driver,” Nico said. “The one with the ram’s horns. I <i
                            class="calibre5">told
                        </i>you that was real.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s why Grover has been watching you,” I said. “To keep you safe, if you
                        turned out to be
                        half-bloods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grover?” Bianca stared at him. “You’re a demigod?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, a satyr, actually.” He kicked off his shoes and displayed his goat
                        hooves. I thought
                        Bianca was going to faint right there. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grover, put your shoes back on,” Thalia said. “You’re freaking her out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, my hooves are clean!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bianca,” I said, “we came here to help you. You and Nico need training to
                        survive. Dr. Thorn
                        won’t be the last monster you meet. You need to come to camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Camp?” she asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Camp Half-Blood,” I said. “It’s where half-bloods learn to survive and stuff.
                        You can join us,
                        stay there year-round if you like.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sweet, let’s go!” said Nico. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait.” Bianca shook her head. “I don’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There <i class="calibre5">is </i>another option,” Zoë said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, there isn’t!” Thalia said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia and Zoë glared at each other. I didn’t know what they were talking
                        about, but I could
                        tell there was bad history between them. For some reason, they seriously hated each other. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ve burdened these children enough,” Artemis announced. “Zoë, we will rest
                        here for a few
                        hours. Raise the tents. Treat the wounded. Retrieve our guests’ belongings from the school.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, my lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And, Bianca, come with me. I would like to speak with you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What about me?” Nico asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis considered the boy. “Perhaps you can show Grover how to play that card
                        game you enjoy.
                        I’m sure Grover would be happy to entertain you for a while…as a favor to me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover just about tripped over himself getting up. “You bet! Come on, Nico!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico and Grover walked off toward the woods, talking about hit points and armor
                        ratings and a
                        bunch of other geeky stuff. Artemis led a confused-looking Bianca along the cliff. The Hunters
                        began unpacking
                        their knapsacks and making camp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë gave Thalia one more evil look, then left to oversee things. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As soon as she was gone, Thalia stamped her foot in frustration. “The nerve of
                        those Hunters!
                        They think they’re so…Argh!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m with you,” I said. “I don’t trust—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, you’re with me?” Thalia turned on me furiously. “What were you thinking
                        back there in the
                        gym, Percy? You’d take on Dr. Thorn all by yourself ? You <i class="calibre5">knew </i>he was a
                        monster!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“If we’d stuck together, we could’ve taken him without the Hunters getting
                        involved. Annabeth
                        might still be here. Did you think of that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My jaw clenched. I thought of some harsh things to say, and I might’ve said
                        them too, but then
                        I looked down and saw something navy blue lying in the snow at my feet. Annabeth’s New York
                        Yankees baseball
                        cap. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/3-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia didn’t say another word. She wiped a tear from her cheek, turned, and
                        marched off,
                        leaving me alone with a trampled cap in the snow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The Hunters set up their camping site in a matter of minutes. Seven large
                        tents, all of silver
                        silk, curved in a crescent around one side of a bonfire. One of the girls blew a silver dog
                        whistle, and a dozen
                        white wolves appeared out of the woods. They began circling the camp like guard dogs. The
                        Hunters walked among
                        them and fed them treats, completely unafraid, but I decided I would stick close to the tents.
                        Falcons watched
                        us from the trees, their eyes flashing in the firelight, and I got the feeling they were on
                        guard duty, too.
                        Even the weather seemed to bend to the goddess’s will. The air was still cold, but the wind died
                        down and the
                        snow stopped falling, so it was almost pleasant sitting by the fire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Almost…except for the pain in my shoulder and the guilt weighing me down. I
                        couldn’t believe
                        Annabeth was gone. And as angry as I was at Thalia, I had a sinking feeling that she was right.
                        It <i class="calibre5">was </i>my fault. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">What had Annabeth wanted to tell me in the gym? <i class="calibre5">Something
                            serious</i>,
                        she’d said. Now I might never find out. I thought about how we’d danced together for half a
                        song, and my heart
                        felt even heavier. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I watched Thalia pacing in the snow at the edge of camp, walking among the
                        wolves without fear.
                        She stopped and looked back at Westover Hall, which was now completely dark, looming on the
                        hillside beyond the
                        woods. I wondered what she was thinking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Seven years ago, Thalia had been turned into a pine tree by her father, to
                        prevent her from
                        dying. She’d stood her ground against an army of monsters on top of Half-Blood Hill in order to
                        give her friends
                        Luke and Annabeth time to escape. She’d only been back as a human for a few months now, and once
                        in a while she
                        would stand so motionless you’d think she was still a tree. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally, one of the Hunters brought me my backpack. Grover and Nico came back
                        from their walk,
                        and Grover helped me fix up my wounded arm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s green!” Nico said with delight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hold still,” Grover told me. “Here, eat some ambrosia while I clean that out.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I winced as he dressed the wound, but the ambrosia square helped. It tasted
                        like homemade
                        brownie, dissolving in my mouth and sending a warm feeling through my whole body. Between that
                        and the magic
                        salve Grover used, my shoulder felt better within a couple of minutes. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/3-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico rummaged through his own bag, which the Hunters had apparently packed for
                        him, though how
                        they’d snuck into Westover Hall unseen, I didn’t know. Nico laid out a bunch of figurines in the
                        snow—little
                        battle replicas of Greek gods and heroes. I recognized Zeus with a lightning bolt, Ares with a
                        spear, Apollo
                        with his sun chariot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Big collection,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico grinned. “I’ve got almost all of them, plus their holographic cards! Well,
                        except for a
                        few really rare ones.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’ve been playing this game a long time?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Just this year. Before that…” He knit his eyebrows. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I forget. That’s weird.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked unsettled, but it didn’t last long. “Hey, can I see that sword you
                        were using?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I showed him Riptide, and explained how it turned from a pen into a sword just
                        by uncapping it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cool! Does it ever run out of ink?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, well, I don’t actually write with it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Are you really the son of Poseidon?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Can you surf really well, then?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at Grover, who was trying hard not to laugh. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Jeez, Nico,” I said. “I’ve never really tried.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He went on asking questions. Did I fight a lot with Thalia, since she was a
                        daughter of Zeus?
                        (I didn’t answer that one.) If Annabeth’s mother was Athena, the goddess of wisdom, then why
                        didn’t Annabeth
                        know better than to fall off a cliff? (I tried not to strangle Nico for asking that one.) Was
                        Annabeth my
                        girlfriend? (At this point, I was ready to stick the kid in a meat-flavored sack and throw him
                        to the wolves.)
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I figured any second he was going to ask me how many hit points I had, and I’d
                        lose my cool
                        completely, but then Zoë Nightshade came up to us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She had dark brown eyes and a slightly upturned nose. With her silver circlet
                        and her proud
                        expression, she looked so much like royalty that I had to resist the urge to sit up straight and
                        say “Yes,
                        ma’am.” She studied me distastefully, like I was a bag of dirty laundry she’d been sent to
                        fetch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Come with me,” she said. “Lady Artemis wishes to speak with thee.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Zoë led me to the last tent, which looked no different from the others, and
                        waved me inside.
                        Bianca di Angelo was seated next to the auburn-haired girl, who I still had trouble thinking of
                        as Artemis. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The inside of the tent was warm and comfortable. Silk rugs and pillows covered
                        the floor. In
                        the center, a golden brazier of fire seemed to burn without fuel or smoke. Behind the goddess,
                        on a polished oak
                        display stand, was her huge silver bow, carved to resemble gazelle horns. The walls were hung
                        with animal pelts:
                        black bear, tiger, and several others I didn’t recognize. I figured an animal rights activist
                        would’ve had a
                        heart attack looking at all those rare skins, but maybe since Artemis was the goddess of the
                        hunt, she could
                        replenish whatever she shot. I thought she had another animal pelt lying next to her, and then I
                        realized it was
                        a live animal—a deer with glittering fur and silver horns, its head resting contentedly in
                        Artemis’s lap. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/3-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Join us, Percy Jackson,” the goddess said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sat across from her on the tent floor. The goddess studied me, which made me
                        uncomfortable.
                        She had such old eyes for a young girl. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Are you surprised by my age?” she asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uh…a little.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I could appear as a grown woman, or a blazing fire, or anything else I want,
                        but this is what
                        I prefer. This is the average age of my Hunters, and all young maidens for whom I am patron,
                        before they go
                        astray.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Go astray?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Grow up. Become smitten with boys. Become silly, preoccupied, insecure. Forget
                        themselves.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë sat down at Artemis’s right. She glared at me as if all the stuff Artemis
                        had just said was
                        my fault, like I’d invented the idea of being a guy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You must forgive my Hunters if they do not welcome you,” Artemis said. “It is
                        very rare that
                        we would have boys in this camp. Boys are usually forbidden to have any contact with the
                        Hunters. The last one
                        to see this camp…” She looked at Zoë. “Which one was it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That boy in Colorado,” Zoë said. “You turned him into a jackalope.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah, yes.” Artemis nodded, satisfied. “I enjoy making jackalopes. At any rate,
                        Percy, I’ve
                        asked you here so that you might tell me more of the manticore. Bianca has reported some of
                        the…mmm, disturbing
                        things the monster said. But she may not have understood them. I’d like to hear them from you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And so I told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When I was done, Artemis put her hand thoughtfully on her silver bow. “I feared
                        this was the
                        answer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë sat forward. “The scent, my lady?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What scent?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Things are stirring that I have not hunted in millennia,” Artemis murmured.
                        “Prey so old I
                        have nearly forgotten.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She stared at me intently. “We came here tonight sensing the manticore, but he
                        was not the one
                        I seek. Tell me again, exactly what Dr. Thorn said.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, ‘I hate middle school dances.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no. After that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He said somebody called the General was going to explain things to me.” Zoë’s
                        face paled. She
                        turned to Artemis and started to say something, but Artemis raised her hand. “Go on, Percy,” the
                        goddess said.
                        “Well, then Thorn was talking about the Great Stir Pot—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Stirring,” Bianca corrected. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah. And he said, ‘Soon we shall have the most important monster of all—the
                        one that shall
                        bring about the downfall of Olympus.’”</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The goddess was so still she could’ve been a statue. “Maybe he was lying,” I
                        said. Artemis
                        shook her head. “No. He was not. I’ve been too slow to see the signs. I must hunt this monster.”
                        Zoë looked like
                        she was trying very hard not to be afraid, but she nodded. “We will leave right away, my lady.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, Zoë. I must do this alone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But, Artemis—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This task is too dangerous even for the Hunters. You know where I must start
                        my search. You
                        cannot go there with me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“As…as you wish, my lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I will find this creature,” Artemis vowed. “And I shall bring it back to
                        Olympus by winter
                        solstice. It will be all the proof I need to convince the Council of the Gods of how much danger
                        we are in.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You know what the monster is?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis gripped her bow. “Let us pray I am wrong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Can goddesses pray?” I asked, because I’d never really thought about that.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A flicker of a smile played across Artemis’s lips. “Before I go, Percy Jackson,
                        I have a small
                        task for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Does it involve getting turned into a jackalope?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sadly, no. I want you to escort the Hunters back to Camp Half-Blood. They can
                        stay there in
                        safety until I return.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“What?” </i>Zoë blurted out. “But, Artemis, we hate that
                        place. The last
                        time we stayed there—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, I know,” Artemis said. “But I’m sure Dionysus will not hold a grudge just
                        because of a
                        little, ah, misunderstanding. It’s your right to use Cabin Eight whenever you are in need.
                        Besides, I hear they
                        rebuilt the cabins you burned down.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë muttered something about foolish campers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And now there is one last decision to make.” Artemis turned to Bianca. “Have
                        you made up your
                        mind, my girl?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca hesitated. “I’m still thinking about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait,” I said. “Thinking about what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They…they’ve invited me to join the Hunt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What? But you can’t! You have to come to Camp Half-Blood so Chiron can train
                        you. It’s the
                        only way you can learn to survive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It is <i class="calibre5">not </i>the only way for a girl,” Zoë said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t believe I was hearing this. “Bianca, camp is cool! It’s got a
                        pegasus stable and a
                        sword-fighting arena and…I mean, what do you get by joining the Hunters?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“To begin with,” Zoë said, “immortality.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at her, then at Artemis. “She’s kidding, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zoë rarely kids about anything,” Artemis said. “My Hunters follow me on my
                        adventures. They
                        are my maidservants, my companions, my sisters-in-arms. Once they swear loyalty to me, they are
                        indeed
                        immortal…unless they fall in battle, which is unlikely. Or break their oath.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What oath?” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“To foreswear romantic love forever,” Artemis said. “To never grow up, never
                        get married. To be
                        a maiden eternally.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Like you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The goddess nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to imagine what she was saying. Being immortal. Hanging out with only
                        middle-school
                        girls forever. I couldn’t get my mind around it. “So you just go around the country recruiting
                        half-bloods—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Not just half-bloods,” Zoë interrupted. “Lady Artemis does not discriminate by
                        birth. All who
                        honor the goddess may join. Half-bloods, nymphs, mortals—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Which are you, then?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Anger flashed in Zoë’s eyes. “That is not thy concern, boy. The point is Bianca
                        may join if she
                        wishes. It is her choice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bianca, this is crazy,” I said. “What about your brother? Nico can’t be a
                        Hunter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Certainly not,” Artemis agreed. “He will go to camp. Unfortunately, that’s the
                        best boys can
                        do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” I protested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You can see him from time to time,” Artemis assured Bianca. “But you will be
                        free of
                        responsibility. He will have the camp counselors to take care of him. And you will have a new
                        family. Us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A new family,” Bianca repeated dreamily. “Free of responsibility.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bianca, you can’t do this,” I said. “It’s nuts.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked at Zoë. “Is it worth it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë nodded. “It is.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do I have to do?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Say this,” Zoë told her, “‘I pledge myself to the goddess Artemis.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I…I pledge myself to the goddess Artemis.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“‘I turn my back on the company of men, accept eternal maidenhood, and join the
                        Hunt.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca repeated the lines. “That’s it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë nodded. “If Lady Artemis accepts thy pledge, then it is binding.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I accept it,” Artemis said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The flames in the brazier brightened, casting a silver glow over the room.
                        Bianca looked no
                        different, but she took a deep breath and opened her eyes wide. “I feel…stronger.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/3-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Welcome, sister,” Zoë said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Remember your pledge,” Artemis said. “It is now your life.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t speak. I felt like a trespasser. And a complete failure. I couldn’t
                        believe I’d come
                        all this way and suffered so much only to lose Bianca to some eternal girls’ club. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Do not despair, Percy Jackson,” Artemis said. “You will still get to show the
                        di Angelos your
                        camp. And if Nico so chooses, he can stay there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Great,” I said, trying not to sound surly. “How are we supposed to get there?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis closed her eyes. “Dawn is approaching. Zoë, break camp. You must get to
                        Long Island
                        quickly and safely. I shall summon a ride from my brother.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë didn’t look real happy about this idea, but she nodded and told Bianca to
                        follow her. As
                        she was leaving, Bianca paused in front of me. “I’m sorry, Percy. But I want this. I really,
                        really do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then she was gone, and I was left alone with the twelve-year-old goddess. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So,” I said glumly. “We’re going to get a ride from your brother, huh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis’s silver eyes gleamed. “Yes, boy. You see, Bianca di Angelo is not the
                        only one with an
                        annoying brother. It’s time for you to meet my irresponsible twin, Apollo.” </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">Artemis assured us that dawn was coming, but you could’ve fooled me. It was
                        colder and darker
                        and snowier than ever. Up on the hill, Westover Hall’s windows were completely lightless. I
                        wondered if the
                        teachers had even noticed the di Angelos and Dr. Thorn were missing yet. I didn’t want to be
                        around when they
                        did. With my luck, the only name Mrs. Gottschalk would remember was “Percy Jackson,” and then
                        I’d be the subject
                        of a nationwide manhunt…again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Hunters broke camp as quickly as they’d set it up. I stood shivering in the
                        snow (unlike
                        the Hunters, who didn’t seem to feel at all uncomfortable), and Artemis stared into the east
                        like she was
                        expecting something. Bianca sat off to one side, talking with Nico. I could tell from his gloomy
                        face that she
                        was explaining her decision to join the Hunt. I couldn’t help thinking how selfish it was of
                        her, abandoning her
                        brother like that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia and Grover came up and huddled around me, anxious to hear what had
                        happened in my
                        audience with the goddess. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When I told them, Grover turned pale. “The last time the Hunters visited camp,
                        it didn’t go
                        well.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How’d they even show up here?” I wondered. “I mean, they just appeared out of
                        nowhere.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And Bianca <i class="calibre5">joined </i>them,” Thalia said, disgusted. “It’s
                        all Zoë’s
                        fault. That stuck-up, no good—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Who can blame her?” Grover said. “Eternity with Artemis?” He heaved a big
                        sigh. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia rolled her eyes. “You satyrs. You’re all in love with Artemis. Don’t you
                        get that she’ll
                        never love you back?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But she’s so…into nature,” Grover swooned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re nuts,” said Thalia. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nuts and berries,” Grover said dreamily. “Yeah.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Finally the sky began to lighten. Artemis muttered, “About time. He’s so-o-o
                        lazy during the
                        winter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re, um, waiting for sunrise?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“For my brother. Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t want to be rude. I mean, I knew the legends about Apollo—or sometimes
                        Helios—driving a
                        big sun chariot across the sky. But I also knew that the sun was really a star about a zillion
                        miles away. I’d
                        gotten used to some of the Greek myths being true, but still…I didn’t see how Apollo could drive
                        the sun. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s not exactly as you think,” Artemis said, like she was reading my mind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, okay.” I started to relax. “So, it’s not like he’ll be pulling up in a—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a sudden burst of light on the horizon. A blast of warmth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t look,” Artemis advised. “Not until he parks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Parks? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I averted my eyes, and saw that the other kids were doing the same. The light
                        and warmth
                        intensified until my winter coat felt like it was melting off of me. Then suddenly the light
                        died. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked. And I couldn’t believe it. It was <i class="calibre5">my </i>car.
                        Well, the car I
                        wanted, anyway. A red convertible Maserati Spyder. It was so awesome it glowed. Then I realized
                        it was glowing
                        because the metal was hot. The snow had melted around the Maserati in a perfect circle, which
                        explained why I
                        was now standing on green grass and my shoes were wet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The driver got out, smiling. He looked about seventeen or eighteen, and for a
                        second, I had the
                        uneasy feeling it was Luke, my old enemy. This guy had the same sandy hair and outdoorsy good
                        looks. But it
                        wasn’t Luke. This guy was taller, with no scar on his face like Luke’s. His smile was brighter
                        and more playful.
                        (Luke didn’t do much more than scowl and sneer these days.) The Maserati driver wore jeans and
                        loafers and a
                        sleeveless T-shirt. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“Wow,” Thalia muttered. “Apollo is hot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He’s the sun god,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s not what I meant.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Little sister!” Apollo called. If his teeth were any whiter he could’ve
                        blinded us without the
                        sun car. “What’s up? You never call. You never write. I was getting worried!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis sighed. “I’m fine, Apollo. And I am not your <i class="calibre5">little
                        </i>sister.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, I was born first.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’re twins! How many millennia do we have to argue—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So what’s up?” he interrupted. “Got the girls with you, I see. You all need
                        some tips on
                        archery?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis grit her teeth. “I need a favor. I have some hunting to do, <i
                            class="calibre5">alone</i>. I need you to take my companions to Camp Half-Blood.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sure, sis!” Then he raised his hands in a <i class="calibre5">stop everything
                        </i>gesture. “I
                        feel a haiku coming on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Hunters all groaned. Apparently they’d met Apollo before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He cleared his throat and held up one hand dramatically. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“Green grass breaks through snow.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Artemis pleads for my help.</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">I am so cool.”</i> </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He grinned at us, waiting for applause. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That last line was only four syllables,” Artemis said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo frowned. “Was it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes. What about <i class="calibre5">I am so big-headed</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no, that’s six syllables. Hmm.” He started muttering to himself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë Nightshade turned to us. “Lord Apollo has been going through this haiku
                        phase ever since he
                        visited Japan. ’Tis not as bad as the time he visited Limerick. If I’d had to hear one more poem
                        that started
                        with, <i class="calibre5">There once was a goddess from Sparta—</i>” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ve got it!” Apollo announced. “<i class="calibre5">I am so awesome.
                        </i>That’s five
                        syllables!” He bowed, looking very pleased with himself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And now, sis. Transportation for the Hunters, you say? Good timing. I was just
                        about ready to
                        roll.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“These demigods will also need a ride,” Artemis said, pointing to us. “Some of
                        Chiron’s
                        campers.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No problem!” Apollo checked us out. “Let’s see…Thalia, right? I’ve heard all
                        about you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia blushed. “Hi, Lord Apollo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Zeus’s girl, yes? Makes you my half sister. Used to be a tree, didn’t you?
                        Glad you’re back. I
                        hate it when pretty girls turn into trees. Man, I remember one time—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Brother,” Artemis said. “You should get going.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, right.” Then he looked at me, and his eyes narrowed. “Percy Jackson?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah. I mean…yes, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It seemed weird calling a teenager “sir,” but I’d learned to be careful with
                        immortals. They
                        tended to get offended easily. Then they blew stuff up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo studied me, but he didn’t say anything, which I found a little creepy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well!” he said at last. “We’d better load up, huh? Ride only goes one
                        way—west. And if you
                        miss it, you miss it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at the Maserati, which would seat two people max. There were about
                        twenty of us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cool car,” Nico said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thanks, kid,” Apollo said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But how will we all fit?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh.” Apollo seemed to notice the problem for the first time. “Well, yeah. I
                        hate to change out
                        of sports-car mode, but I suppose…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He took out his car keys and beeped the security alarm button. <i
                            class="calibre5">Chirp,
                            chirp. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">For a moment, the car glowed brightly again. When the glare died, the Maserati
                        had been
                        replaced by one of those Turtle Top shuttle buses like we used for school basketball games. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right,” he said. “Everybody in.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë ordered the Hunters to start loading. She picked up her camping pack, and
                        Apollo said,
                        “Here, sweetheart. Let me get that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë recoiled. Her eyes flashed murderously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Brother,” Artemis chided. “You do not help my Hunters. You do not look at,
                        talk to, or flirt
                        with my Hunters. And you do <i class="calibre5">not </i>call them sweetheart.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo spread his hands. “Sorry. I forgot. Hey, sis, where are you off to,
                        anyway?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hunting,” Artemis said. “It’s none of your business.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll find out. I see all. Know all.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis snorted. “Just drop them off, Apollo. And no messing around!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no! I never mess around.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis rolled her eyes, then looked at us. “I will see you by winter solstice.
                        Zoë, you are in
                        charge of the Hunters. Do well. Do as I would do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë straightened. “Yes, my lady.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Artemis knelt and touched the ground as if looking for tracks. When she rose,
                        she looked
                        troubled. “So much danger. The beast must be found.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She sprinted toward the woods and melted into the snow and shadows. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Apollo turned and grinned, jangling the car keys on his finger. “So,” he said.
                        “Who wants to
                        drive?” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The Hunters piled into the van. They all crammed into the back so they’d be as
                        far away as
                        possible from Apollo and the rest of us highly infectious males. Bianca sat with them, leaving
                        her little
                        brother to hang in the front with us, which seemed cold to me, but Nico didn’t seem to mind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This is so cool!” Nico said, jumping up and down in the driver’s seat. “Is
                        this really the
                        sun? I thought Helios and Selene were the sun and moon gods. How come sometimes it’s them and
                        sometimes it’s you
                        and Artemis?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Downsizing,” Apollo said. “The Romans started it. They couldn’t afford all
                        those temple
                        sacrifices, so they laid off Helios and Selene and folded their duties into our job
                        descriptions. My sis got the
                        moon. I got the sun. It was pretty annoying at first, but at least I got this cool car.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But how does it work?” Nico asked. “I thought the sun was a big fiery ball of
                        gas!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo chuckled and ruffled Nico’s hair. “That rumor probably got started
                        because Artemis used
                        to call me a big fiery ball of gas. Seriously, kid, it depends on whether you’re talking
                        astronomy or
                        philosophy. You want to talk astronomy? Bah, what fun is that? You want to talk about how humans
                        <i class="calibre5">think </i>about the sun? Ah, now that’s more interesting. They’ve got a lot
                        riding on the
                        sun…er, so to speak. It keeps them warm, grows their crops, powers engines, makes everything
                        look, well,
                        sunnier. This chariot is built out of human <i class="calibre5">dreams </i>about the sun, kid.
                        It’s as old as
                        Western Civilization. Every day, it drives across the sky from east to west, lighting up all
                        those puny little
                        mortal lives. The chariot is a manifestation of the sun’s power, the way mortals perceive it.
                        Make sense?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico shook his head. “No.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well then, just think of it as a really powerful, really dangerous solar car.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Can I drive?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No. Too young.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oo! Oo!” Grover raised his hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mm, no,” Apollo said. “Too furry.” He looked past me and focused on Thalia.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Daughter of Zeus!” he said. “Lord of the sky. Perfect.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, no.” Thalia shook her head. “No, thanks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“C’mon,” Apollo said. “How old are you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia hesitated. “I don’t know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was sad, but true. She’d been turned into a tree when she was twelve, but
                        that had been
                        seven years ago. So she should be nineteen, if you went by years. But she still felt like she
                        was twelve, and if
                        you looked at her, she seemed somewhere in between. The best Chiron could figure, she had kept
                        aging while in
                        tree form, but much more slowly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo tapped his finger to his lips. “You’re fifteen, almost sixteen.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How do you know that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey, I’m the god of prophecy. I know stuff. You’ll turn sixteen in about a
                        week.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s my birthday! December twenty-second.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Which means you’re old enough now to drive with a learner’s permit!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia shifted her feet nervously. “Uh—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know what you’re going to say,” Apollo said. “You don’t deserve an honor
                        like driving the
                        sun chariot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s not what I was going to say.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t sweat it! Maine to Long Island is a really short trip, and don’t worry
                        about what
                        happened to the last kid I trained. You’re Zeus’s daughter. He’s not going to blast <i

                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo laughed good-naturedly. The rest of us didn’t join him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia tried to protest, but Apollo was absolutely not going to take “no” for
                        an answer. He hit
                        a button on the dashboard, and a sign popped up along the top of the windshield. I had to read
                        it backward
                        (which, for a dyslexic, really isn’t that different than reading forward). I was pretty sure it
                        said <small class="calibre4">WARNING: STUDENT DRIVER.</small> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Take it away!” Apollo told Thalia. “You’re gonna be a natural!” </p>

                        that was a Japanese compact, and this was the sun chariot, but how different could it be? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Speed equals heat,” Apollo advised. “So start slowly, and make sure you’ve got
                        good altitude
                        before you really open her up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia gripped the wheel so tight her knuckles turned white. She looked like
                        she was going to
                        be sick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What’s wrong?” I asked her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nothing,” she said shakily. “N-nothing is wrong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pulled back on the wheel. It tilted, and the bus lurched upward so fast I
                        fell back and
                        crashed against something soft. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ow,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Slower!” Apollo said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry!” Thalia said. “I’ve got it under control!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I managed to get to my feet. Looking out the window, I saw a smoking ring of
                        trees from the
                        clearing where we’d taken off. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thalia,” I said, “lighten up on the accelerator.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ve <i class="calibre5">got </i>it, Percy,” she said, gritting her teeth. But
                        she kept it
                        floored. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Loosen up,” I told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m loose!” Thalia said. She was so stiff she looked like she was made out of
                        plywood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We need to veer south for Long Island,” Apollo said. “Hang a left.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia jerked the wheel and again threw me into Grover, who yelped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The other left,” Apollo suggested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I made the mistake of looking out the window again. We were at airplane height
                        now—so high the
                        sky was starting to look black. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah…” Apollo said, and I got the feeling he was forcing himself to sound calm.
                        “A little lower,
                        sweetheart. Cape Cod is freezing over.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia tilted the wheel. Her face was chalk white, her forehead beaded with
                        sweat. Something
                        was definitely wrong. I’d never seen her like this. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The bus pitched down and somebody screamed. Maybe it was me. Now we were
                        heading straight
                        toward the Atlantic Ocean at a thousand miles an hour, the New England coastline off to our
                        right. And it was
                        getting hot in the bus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Apollo had been thrown somewhere in the back of the bus, but he started
                        climbing up the rows of
                        seats. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Take the wheel!” Grover begged him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No worries,” Apollo said. He looked plenty worried. “She just has to learn
                        to—WHOA!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I saw what he was seeing. Down below us was a little snow-covered New England
                        town. At least,
                        it used to be snow-covered. As I watched, the snow melted off the trees and the roofs and the
                        lawns. The white
                        steeple on a church turned brown and started to smolder. Little plumes of smoke, like birthday
                        candles, were
                        popping up all over the town. Trees and rooftops were catching fire. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/4-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Pull up!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a wild light in Thalia’s eyes. She yanked back on the wheel, and I
                        held on this time.
                        As we zoomed up, I could see through the back window that the fires in the town were being
                        snuffed out by the
                        sudden blast of cold. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There!” Apollo pointed. “Long Island, dead ahead. Let’s slow down, dear.
                        ‘Dead’ is only an
                        expression.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia was thundering toward the coastline of northern Long Island. There was
                        Camp Half-Blood:
                        the valley, the woods, the beach. I could see the dining pavilion and cabins and the
                        amphitheater. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m under control,” Thalia muttered. “I’m under control.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We were only a few hundred yards away now. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Brake,” Apollo said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I can do this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“BRAKE!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia slammed her foot on the brake, and the sun bus pitched forward at a
                        forty-five-degree
                        angle, slamming into the Camp Half-Blood canoe lake with a huge <i class="calibre5">FLOOOOOOSH!
                        </i>Steam
                        billowed up, sending several frightened naiads scrambling out of the water with half-woven
                        wicker baskets. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The bus bobbed to the surface, along with a couple of capsized, half-melted
                        canoes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well,” said Apollo with a brave smile. “You were right, my dear. You had
                        everything under
                        control! Let’s go see if we boiled anyone important, shall we?” </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">I’d never seen Camp Half-Blood in winter before, and the snow surprised me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">See, the camp has the ultimate magic climate control. Nothing gets inside the
                        borders unless
                        the director, Mr. D, wants it to. I thought it would be warm and sunny, but instead the snow had
                        been allowed to
                        fall lightly. Frost covered the chariot track and the strawberry fields. The cabins were
                        decorated with tiny
                        flickering lights, like Christmas lights, except they seemed to be balls of real fire. More
                        lights glowed in the
                        woods, and weirdest of all, a fire flickered in the attic window of the Big House, where the
                        Oracle dwelt,
                        imprisoned in an old mummified body. I wondered if the spirit of Delphi was roasting
                        marshmallows up there or
                        something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whoa,” Nico said as he climbed off the bus. “Is that a climbing wall?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why is there lava pouring down it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Little extra challenge. Come on. I’ll introduce you to Chiron. Zoë, have you
                        met—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I know Chiron,” Zoë said stiffly. “Tell him we will be in Cabin Eight.
                        Hunters, follow me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll show you the way,” Grover offered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We know the way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, really, it’s no trouble. It’s easy to get lost here, if you don’t”—he
                        tripped over a canoe
                        and came up still talking—“like my old daddy goat used to say! Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë rolled her eyes, but I guess she figured there was no getting rid of
                        Grover. The Hunters
                        shouldered their packs and their bows and headed off toward the cabins. As Bianca di Angelo was
                        leaving, she
                        leaned over and whispered something in her brother’s ear. She looked at him for an answer, but
                        Nico just scowled
                        and turned away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Take care, sweethearts!” Apollo called after the Hunters. He winked at me.
                        “Watch out for
                        those prophecies, Percy. I’ll see you soon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Instead of answering, he hopped back in the bus. “Later, Thalia,” he called.
                        “And, uh, be
                        good!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He gave her a wicked smile, as if he knew something she didn’t. Then he closed
                        the doors and
                        revved the engine. I turned aside as the sun chariot took off in a blast of heat. When I looked
                        back, the lake
                        was steaming. A red Maserati soared over the woods, glowing brighter and climbing higher until
                        it disappeared in
                        a ray of sunlight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico was still looking grumpy. I wondered what his sister had told him. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Who’s Chiron?” he asked. “I don’t have his figurine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Our activities director,” I said. “He’s…well, you’ll see.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If those Hunter girls don’t like him,” Nico grumbled, “that’s good enough for
                        me. Let’s go.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The second thing that surprised me about camp was how empty it was. I mean, I
                        knew most
                        half-bloods only trained during the summer. Just the year-rounders would be here—the ones who
                        didn’t have homes
                        to go to, or would get attacked by monsters too much if they left. But there didn’t even seem to
                        be many of
                        them, either. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I spotted Charles Beckendorf from the Hephaestus cabin stoking the forge
                        outside the camp
                        armory. The Stoll brothers, Travis and Connor, from the Hermes cabin, were picking the lock on
                        the camp store. A
                        few kids from the Ares cabin were having a snowball fight with the wood nymphs at the edge of
                        the forest. That
                        was about it. Even my old rival from the Ares cabin, Clarisse, didn’t seem to be around. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Big House was decorated with strings of red and yellow fireballs that
                        warmed the porch but
                        didn’t seem to catch anything on fire. Inside, flames crackled in the hearth. The air smelled
                        like hot
                        chocolate. Mr. D, the camp director, and Chiron were playing a quiet game of cards in the
                        parlor. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron’s brown beard was shaggier for the winter. His curly hair had grown a
                        little longer. He
                        wasn’t posing as a teacher this year, so I guess he could afford to be casual. He wore a fuzzy
                        sweater with a
                        hoofprint design on it, and he had a blanket on his lap that almost hid his wheelchair
                        completely. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He smiled when he saw us. “Percy! Thalia! Ah, and this must be—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nico di Angelo,” I said. “He and his sister are half-bloods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron breathed a sigh of relief. “You succeeded, then.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His smile melted. “What’s wrong? And where is Annabeth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, dear,” Mr. D said in a bored voice. “Not another one lost.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I’d been trying not to pay attention to Mr. D, but he was kind of hard to
                        ignore in his neon
                        orange leopard-skin warm-up suit and his purple running shoes. (Like Mr. D had ever run a day in
                        his immortal
                        life.) A golden laurel wreath was tilted sideways on his curly black hair, which must’ve meant
                        he’d won the last
                        hand of cards. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” Thalia asked. “Who else is lost?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Just then, Grover trotted into the room, grinning like crazy. He had a black
                        eye and red lines
                        on his face that looked like a slap mark. “The Hunters are all moved in!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron frowned. “The Hunters, eh? I see we have much to talk about.” He glanced
                        at Nico.
                        “Grover, perhaps you should take our young friend to the den and show him our orientation film.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But…Oh, right. Yes, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Orientation film?” Nico asked. “Is it G or PG? ’Cause Bianca is kinda strict—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s PG-13,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cool!” Nico happily followed him out of the room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Now,” Chiron said to Thalia and me, “perhaps you two should sit down and tell
                        us the whole
                        story.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When we were done, Chiron turned to Mr. D. “We should launch a search for
                        Annabeth
                        immediately.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll go,” Thalia and I said at the same time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D sniffed. “Certainly not!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia and I both started complaining, but Mr. D held up his hand. He had that
                        purplish angry
                        fire in his eyes that usually meant something bad and godly was going to happen if we didn’t
                        shut up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“From what you have told me,” Mr. D said, “we have broken even on this
                        escapade. We have, ah,
                        regrettably lost Annie Bell—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth,” I snapped. She’d gone to camp since she was seven, and still Mr. D
                        pretended not to
                        know her name. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, yes,” he said. “And you procured a small annoying boy to replace her. So
                        I see no point
                        risking further half-bloods on a ridiculous rescue. The possibility is very great that this
                        Annie girl is dead.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wanted to strangle Mr. D. It wasn’t fair Zeus had sent him here to dry out as
                        camp director
                        for a hundred years. It was meant to be a punishment for Mr. D’s bad behavior on Olympus, but it
                        ended up being
                        a punishment for all of us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth may be alive,” Chiron said, but I could tell he was having trouble
                        sounding upbeat.
                        He’d practically raised Annabeth all those years she was a year-round camper, before she’d given
                        living with her
                        dad and stepmom a second try. “She’s very bright. If…if our enemies have her, she will try to
                        play for time. She
                        may even pretend to cooperate.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s right,” Thalia said. “Luke would want her alive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“In which case,” said Mr. D, “I’m afraid she will have to be smart enough to
                        escape on her
                        own.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I got up from the table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy.” Chiron’s tone was full of warning. In the back of my mind, I knew Mr.
                        D was not
                        somebody to mess with. Even if you were an impulsive ADHD kid like me, he wouldn’t give you any
                        slack. But I was
                        so angry I didn’t care. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re glad to lose another camper,” I said. “You’d like it if we all
                        disappeared!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D stifled a yawn. “You have a point?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” I growled. “Just because you were sent here as a punishment doesn’t
                        mean you have to be
                        a lazy jerk! This is your civilization, too. Maybe you could try helping out a little!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">For a second, there was no sound except the crackle of the fire. The light
                        reflected in Mr. D’s
                        eyes, giving him a sinister look. He opened his mouth to say something—probably a curse that
                        would blast me to
                        smithereens—when Nico burst into the room, followed by Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“SO COOL!” Nico yelled, holding his hands out to Chiron. “You’re…you’re a
                        centaur!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron managed a nervous smile. “Yes, Mr. di Angelo, if you please. Though, I
                        prefer to stay in
                        human form in this wheelchair for, ah, first encounters.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And, whoa!” He looked at Mr. D. “You’re the wine dude? No way!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. D turned his eyes away from me and gave Nico a look of loathing. “The wine
                        dude?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dionysus, right? Oh, wow! I’ve got your figurine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“My figurine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“In my game, Mythomagic. And a holofoil card, too! And even though you’ve only
                        got like five
                        hundred attack points and everybody thinks you’re the lamest god card, I totally think your
                        powers are sweet!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah.” Mr. D seemed truly perplexed, which probably saved my life. “Well,
                        that’s…gratifying.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy,” Chiron said quickly, “you and Thalia go down to the cabins. Inform the
                        campers we’ll
                        be playing capture the flag tomorrow evening.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Capture the flag?” I asked. “But we don’t have enough—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It is a tradition,” Chiron said. “A friendly match, whenever the Hunters
                        visit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” Thalia muttered. “I bet it’s real friendly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron jerked his head toward Mr. D, who was still frowning as Nico talked
                        about how many
                        defense points all the gods had in his game. “Run along now,” Chiron told us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, right,” Thalia said. “Come on, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She hauled me out of the Big House before Dionysus could remember that he
                        wanted to kill me.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">“You’ve already got Ares on your bad side,” Thalia reminded me as we trudged
                        toward the cabins.
                        “You need another immortal enemy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She was right. My first summer as a camper, I’d gotten in a fight with Ares,
                        and now he and all
                        his children wanted to kill me. I didn’t need to make Dionysus mad, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry,” I said. “I couldn’t help it. It’s just so unfair.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She stopped by the armory and looked out across the valley, toward the top of
                        Half-Blood Hill.
                        Her pine tree was still there, the Golden Fleece glittering in its lowest branch. The tree’s
                        magic still
                        protected the borders of camp, but it no longer used Thalia’s spirit for power. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, everything is unfair,” Thalia muttered. “Sometimes I wish…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She didn’t finish, but her tone was so sad I felt sorry for her. With her
                        ragged black hair and
                        her black punk clothes, an old wool overcoat wrapped around her, she looked like some kind of
                        huge raven,
                        completely out of place in the white landscape. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll get Annabeth back,” I promised. “I just don’t know how yet.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“First I found out that Luke is lost,” she said. “Now Annabeth—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t think like that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re right.” She straightened up. “We’ll find a way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Over at the basketball court, a few of the Hunters were shooting hoops. One of
                        them was arguing
                        with a guy from the Ares cabin. The Ares kid had his hand on his sword and the Hunter girl
                        looked like she was
                        going to exchange her basketball for a bow and arrow any second. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll break that up,” Thalia said. “You circulate around the cabins. Tell
                        everybody about
                        capture the flag tomorrow.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right. You should be team captain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, no,” she said. “You’ve been at camp longer. You do it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We can, uh…co-captain or something.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked about as comfortable with that as I felt, but she nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As she headed for the court, I said, “Hey, Thalia.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m sorry about what happened at Westover. I should’ve waited for you guys.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“’S okay, Percy. I probably would’ve done the same thing.” She shifted from
                        foot to foot, like
                        she was trying to decide whether or not to say more. “You know, you asked about my mom and I
                        kinda snapped at
                        you. It’s just…I went back to find her after seven years, and I found out she died in Los
                        Angeles. She, um…she
                        was a heavy drinker, and apparently she was out driving late one night about two years ago,
                        and…” Thalia blinked
                        hard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, well. It’s…it’s not like we were ever close. I ran away when I was ten.
                        Best two years
                        of my life were when I was running around with Luke and Annabeth. But still—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s why you had trouble with the sun van.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She gave me a wary look. “What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The way you stiffened up. You must’ve been thinking about your mom, not
                        wanting to get behind
                        the wheel.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was sorry I’d said anything. Thalia’s expression was dangerously close to
                        Zeus’s, the one
                        time I’d seen him get angry—like any minute, her eyes would shoot a million volts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah,” she muttered. “Yeah, that must’ve been it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She trudged off toward the court, where the Ares camper and the Hunter were
                        trying to kill each
                        other with a sword and a basketball. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The cabins were the weirdest collection of buildings you’ve ever seen. Zeus and
                        Hera’s big
                        white-columned buildings, Cabins One and Two, stood in the middle, with five gods’ cabins on the
                        left and five
                        goddesses’ cabins on the right, so they all made a U around the central green and the barbecue
                        hearth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I made the rounds, telling everybody about capture the flag. I woke up some
                        Ares kid from his
                        midday nap and he yelled at me to go away. When I asked him where Clarisse was he said, “Went on
                        a quest for
                        Chiron. Top secret!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Is she okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Haven’t heard from her in a month. She’s missing in action. Like your butt’s
                        gonna be if you
                        don’t get outta here!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I decided to let him go back to sleep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finally I got to Cabin Three, the cabin of Poseidon. It was a low gray building
                        hewn from sea
                        stone, with shells and coral fossils imprinted in the rock. Inside, it was just as empty as
                        always, except for
                        my bunk. A Minotaur horn hung on the wall next to my pillow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I took Annabeth’s baseball cap out of my backpack and set it on my nightstand.
                        I’d give it to
                        her when I found her. And I <i class="calibre5">would </i>find her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I took off my wristwatch and activated the shield. It creaked noisily as it
                        spiraled out. Dr.
                        Thorn’s spikes had dented the brass in a dozen places. One gash kept the shield from opening all
                        the way, so it
                        looked like a pizza with two slices missing. The beautiful metal pictures that my brother had
                        crafted were all
                        banged up. In the picture of me and Annabeth fighting the Hydra, it looked like a meteor had
                        made a crater in my
                        head. I hung the shield on its hook, next to the Minotaur horn, but it was painful to look at
                        now. Maybe
                        Beckendorf from the Hephaestus cabin could fix it for me. He was the best armorsmith in the
                        camp. I’d ask him at
                        dinner. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I was staring at the shield when I noticed a strange sound—water gurgling—and I
                        realized there
                        was something new in the room. At the back of the cabin was a big basin of gray sea rock, with a
                        spout like the
                        head of a fish carved in stone. Out of its mouth burst a stream of water, a saltwater spring
                        that trickled into
                        the pool. The water must’ve been hot, because it sent mist into the cold winter air like a
                        sauna. It made the
                        room feel warm and summery, fresh with the smell of the sea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stepped up to the pool. There was no note attached or anything, but I knew it
                        could only be a
                        gift from Poseidon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked into the water and said, “Thanks, Dad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The surface rippled. At the bottom of the pool, coins shimmered—a dozen or so
                        golden drachma. I
                        realized what the fountain was for. It was a reminder to keep in touch with my family. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I opened the nearest window, and the wintry sunlight made a rainbow in the
                        mist. Then I fished
                        a coin out of the hot water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Iris, O Goddess of the Rainbow,” I said, “accept my offering.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tossed a coin into the mist and it disappeared. Then I realized I didn’t know
                        who to contact
                        first. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mom? That would’ve been the “good son” thing to do, but she wouldn’t be
                        worried about me
                        yet. She was used to me disappearing for days or weeks at a time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My father? It had been way too long, almost two years, since I’d actually
                        talked to him. But
                        could you even send an Iris-message to a god? I’d never tried. Would it make them mad, like a
                        sales call or
                        something? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hesitated. Then I made up my mind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Show me Tyson,” I requested. “At the forges of the Cyclopes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The mist shimmered, and the image of my half brother appeared. He was
                        surrounded in fire, which
                        would’ve been a problem if he weren’t a Cyclops. He was bent over an anvil, hammering a red-hot
                        sword blade.
                        Sparks flew and flames swirled around his body. There was a marble-framed window behind him, and
                        it looked out
                        onto dark blue water—the bottom of the ocean. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tyson!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He didn’t hear me at first because of the hammering and the roar of the flames.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“TYSON!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He turned, and his one enormous eye widened. His face broke into a crooked
                        yellow grin.
                        “Percy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He dropped the sword blade and ran at me, trying to give me a hug. The vision
                        blurred and I
                        instinctively lurched back. “Tyson, it’s an Iris-message. I’m not really here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh.” He came back into view, looking embarrassed. “Oh, I knew that. Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How are you?” I asked. “How’s the job?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">His eye lit up. “Love the job! Look!” He picked up the hot sword blade with his
                        bare hands. “I
                        made this!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s really cool.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I wrote my name on it. Right there.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Awesome. Listen, do you talk to Dad much?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson’s smile faded. “Not much. Daddy is busy. He is worried about the war.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson sighed. He stuck the sword blade out the window, where it made a cloud of
                        boiling
                        bubbles. When Tyson brought it back in, the metal was cool. “Old sea spirits making trouble.
                        Aigaios. Oceanus.
                        Those guys.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sort of knew what he was talking about. He meant the immortals who ruled the
                        oceans back in
                        the days of the Titans. Before the Olympians took over. The fact that they were back now, with
                        the Titan Lord
                        Kronos and his allies gaining strength, was not good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Is there anything I can do?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson shook his head sadly. “We are arming the mermaids. They need a thousand
                        more swords by
                        tomorrow.” He looked at his sword blade and sighed. “Old spirits are protecting the bad boat.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The <i class="calibre5">Princess Andromeda</i>?” I said. “Luke’s boat?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes. They make it hard to find. Protect it from Daddy’s storms. Otherwise he
                        would smash it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Smashing it would be good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Tyson perked up, as if he’d just had another thought. “Annabeth! Is she there?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, well…” My heart felt like a bowling ball. Tyson thought Annabeth was just
                        about the
                        coolest thing since peanut butter (and he seriously loved peanut butter). I didn’t have the
                        heart to tell him
                        she was missing. He’d start crying so bad he’d probably put out his fires. “Well, no…she’s not
                        here right now.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Tell her hello!” He beamed. “Hello to Annabeth!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Okay.” I fought back a lump in my throat. “I’ll do that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And, Percy, don’t worry about the bad boat. It is going away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Panama Canal! Very far away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I frowned. Why would Luke take his demon-infested cruise ship all the way down
                        there? The last
                        time we’d seen him, he’d been cruising along the East Coast, recruiting half-bloods and training
                        his monstrous
                        army. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right,” I said, not feeling reassured. “That’s…good. I guess.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">In the forges, a deep voice bellowed something I couldn’t make out. Tyson
                        flinched. “Got to get
                        back to work! Boss will get mad. Good luck, Brother!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ok, tell Dad—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But before I could finish, the vision shimmered and faded. I was alone again in
                        my cabin,
                        feeling even lonelier than before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I was pretty miserable at dinner that night. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I mean, the food was excellent as usual. You can’t go wrong with barbecue,
                        pizza, and
                        never-empty soda goblets. The torches and braziers kept the outdoor pavilion warm, but we all
                        had to sit with
                        our cabin mates, which meant I was alone at the Poseidon table. Thalia sat alone at the Zeus
                        table, but we
                        couldn’t sit together. Camp rules. At least the Hephaestus, Ares, and Hermes cabins had a few
                        people each. Nico
                        sat with the Stoll brothers, since new campers always got stuck in the Hermes cabin if their
                        Olympian parent was
                        unknown. The Stoll brothers seemed to be trying to convince Nico that poker was a much better
                        game than
                        Mythomagic. I hoped Nico didn’t have any money to lose. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The only table that really seemed to be having a good time was the Artemis
                        table. The Hunters
                        drank and ate and laughed like one big happy family. Zoë sat at the head like she was the mama.
                        She didn’t laugh
                        as much as the others, but she did smile from time to time. Her silver lieutenant’s band
                        glittered in the dark
                        braids of her hair. I thought she looked a lot nicer when she smiled. Bianca di Angelo seemed to
                        be having a
                        great time. She was trying to learn how to arm wrestle from the big girl who’d picked a fight
                        with the Ares kid
                        on the basketball court. The bigger girl was beating her every time, but Bianca didn’t seem to
                        mind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When we’d finished eating, Chiron made the customary toast to the gods and
                        formally welcomed
                        the Hunters of Artemis. The clapping was pretty half hearted. Then he announced the “good will”
                        capture-the-flag
                        game for tomorrow night, which got a lot better reception. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Afterward, we all trailed back to our cabins for an early, winter lights out. I
                        was exhausted,
                        which meant I fell asleep easily. That was the good part. The bad part was, I had a nightmare,
                        and even by my
                        standards it was a whopper. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Annabeth was on a dark hillside, shrouded in fog. It almost seemed like the
                        Underworld, because
                        I immediately felt claustrophobic and I couldn’t see the sky above—just a close, heavy darkness,
                        as if I were in
                        a cave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth struggled up the hill. Old broken Greek columns of black marble were
                        scattered around,
                        as though something had blasted a huge building to ruins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thorn!” Annabeth cried. “Where are you? Why did you bring me here?” She
                        scrambled over a
                        section of broken wall and came to the crest of the hill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was Luke. And he was in pain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He was crumpled on the rocky ground, trying to rise. The blackness seemed to be
                        thicker around
                        him, fog swirling hungrily. His clothes were in tatters and his face was scratched and drenched
                        with sweat. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/5-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Annabeth!” he called. “Help me! Please!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She ran forward. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to cry out: <i class="calibre5">He’s a traitor! Don’t trust him! </i>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But my voice didn’t work in the dream. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth had tears in her eyes. She reached down like she wanted to touch
                        Luke’s face, but at
                        the last second she hesitated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What happened?” she asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They left me here,” Luke groaned. “Please. It’s killing me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I couldn’t see what was wrong with him. He seemed to be struggling against some
                        invisible
                        curse, as though the fog were squeezing him to death. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Why should I trust you?” Annabeth asked. Her voice was filled with hurt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You shouldn’t,” Luke said. “I’ve been terrible to you. But if you don’t help
                        me, I’ll die.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Let him die, </i>I wanted to scream. Luke had tried to kill
                        us in cold
                        blood too many times. He didn’t deserve anything from Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then the darkness above Luke began to crumble, like a cavern roof in an
                        earthquake. Huge chunks
                        of black rock began falling. Annabeth rushed in just as a crack appeared, and the whole ceiling
                        dropped. She
                        held it somehow—tons of rock. She kept it from collapsing on her and Luke just with her own
                        strength. It was
                        impossible. She shouldn’t have been able to do that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke rolled free, gasping. “Thanks,” he managed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Help me hold it,” Annabeth groaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Luke caught his breath. His face was covered in grime and sweat. He rose
                        unsteadily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I knew I could count on you.” He began to walk away as the trembling blackness
                        threatened to
                        crush Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“HELP ME!” she pleaded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, don’t worry,” Luke said. “Your help is on the way. It’s all part of the
                        plan. In the
                        meantime, try not to die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The ceiling of darkness began to crumble again, pushing Annabeth against the

                        gurgle of the saltwater spring. The clock on my nightstand read just after midnight. </p>

                    <p class="no-indent">The next morning after breakfast, I told Grover about my dream. We sat in the
                        meadow watching
                        the satyrs chase the wood nymphs through the snow. The nymphs had promised to kiss the satyrs if
                        they got
                        caught, but they hardly ever did. Usually the nymph would let the satyr get up a full head of
                        steam, then she’d
                        turn into a snow-covered tree and the poor satyr would slam into it headfirst and get a pile of
                        snow dumped on
                        him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">When I told Grover my nightmare, he started twirling his finger in his shaggy
                        leg fur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A cave ceiling collapsed on her?” he asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah. What the heck does that mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover shook his head. “I don’t know. But after what Zoë dreamed—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whoa. What do you mean? Zoë had a dream like that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I…I don’t know, exactly. About three in the morning she came to the Big House
                        and demanded to
                        talk to Chiron. She looked really panicked.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Wait, how do you know this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover blushed. “I was sort of camped outside the Artemis cabin.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Just to be, you know, near them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You’re a stalker with hooves.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/6-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“I am not! Anyway, I followed her to the Big House and hid in a bush and
                        watched the whole
                        thing. She got real upset when Argus wouldn’t let her in. It was kind of a dangerous scene.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to imagine that. Argus was the head of security for camp—a big blond
                        dude with eyes all
                        over his body. He rarely showed himself unless something serious was going on. I wouldn’t want
                        to place bets on
                        a fight between him and Zoë Nightshade. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What did she say?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover grimaced. “Well, she starts talking really old-fashioned when she gets
                        upset, so it was
                        kind of hard to understand. But something about Artemis being in trouble and needing the
                        Hunters. And then she
                        called Argus a boil-brained lout…I think that’s a bad thing. And then he called her—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whoa, wait. How could Artemis be in trouble?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I…well, finally Chiron came out in his pajamas and his horse tail in curlers
                        and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He wears curlers in his tail?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover covered his mouth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry,” I said. “Go on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, Zoë said she needed permission to leave camp immediately. Chiron
                        refused. He reminded
                        Zoë that the Hunters were supposed to stay here until they received orders from Artemis. And she
                        said…” Grover
                        gulped. “She said ‘How are we to get orders from Artemis if Artemis is lost?’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What do you mean lost? Like she needs directions?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No. I think she meant gone. Taken. Kidnapped.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">“Kidnapped?” </i>I tried to get my mind around that idea.
                        “How would you
                        kidnap an immortal goddess? Is that even possible?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, yeah. I mean, it happened to Persephone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But she was like, the goddess of <i class="calibre5">flowers</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked offended. “Springtime.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Whatever. Artemis is a lot more powerful than that. Who could kidnap her? And
                        why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover shook his head miserably. “I don’t know. Kronos?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“He can’t be that powerful already. Can he?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The last time we’d seen Kronos, he’d been in tiny pieces. Well…we hadn’t
                        actually <i class="calibre5">seen </i>him. Thousands of years ago, after the big Titan–God war,
                        the gods had sliced him
                        to bits with his own scythe and scattered his remains in Tartarus, which is like the gods’
                        bottomless recycling
                        bin for their enemies. Two summers ago, Kronos had tricked us to the very edge of the pit and
                        almost pulled us
                        in. Then last summer, on board Luke’s demon cruise ship, we’d seen a golden coffin, where Luke
                        claimed he was
                        summoning the Titan Lord out of the abyss, bit by bit, every time someone new joined their
                        cause. Kronos could
                        influence people with dreams and trick them, but I didn’t see how he could physically overcome
                        Artemis if he was
                        still like a pile of evil bark mulch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I don’t know,” Grover said. “I think somebody would know if Kronos had
                        re-formed. The gods
                        would be more nervous. But still, it’s weird, you having a nightmare the same night as Zoë. It’s
                        almost like—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“They’re connected,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Over in the frozen meadow, a satyr skidded on his hooves as he chased after a
                        redheaded tree
                        nymph. She giggled and held out her arms as he ran toward her. <i class="calibre5">Pop! </i>She
                        turned into a
                        Scotch pine and he kissed the trunk at top speed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ah, love,” Grover said dreamily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I thought about Zoë’s nightmare, which she’d had only a few hours after mine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ve got to talk to Zoë,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, before you do…” Grover took something out of his coat pocket. It was a
                        three-fold display
                        like a travel brochure. “You remember what you said—about how it was weird the Hunters just
                        happened to show up
                        at Westover Hall? I think they might’ve been scouting us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Scouting us? What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He gave me the brochure. It was about the Hunters of Artemis. The front read,
                        <small class="calibre4">A WISE CHOICE FOR YOUR FUTURE</small>! Inside were pictures of young
                        maidens doing hunter
                        stuff, chasing monsters, shooting bows. There were captions like: <small class="calibre4">HEALTH
                            BENEFITS:
                            IMMORTALITY AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR YOU!</small> and <small class="calibre4">A BOY-FREE
                            TOMORROW!</small>
                    </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">“I found that in Annabeth’s backpack,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at him. “I don’t understand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, it seems to me…maybe Annabeth was thinking about joining.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">I’d like to say I took the news well. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The truth was, I wanted to strangle the Hunters of Artemis one eternal maiden
                        at a time. The
                        rest of the day I tried to keep busy, but I was worried sick about Annabeth. I went to
                        javelin-throwing class,
                        but the Ares camper in charge chewed me out after I got distracted and threw the javelin at the
                        target before he
                        got out of the way. I apologized for the hole in his pants, but he still sent me packing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I visited the pegasus stables, but Silena Beauregard from the Aphrodite cabin
                        was having an
                        argument with one of the Hunters, and I decided I’d better not get involved. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">After that, I sat in the empty chariot stands and sulked. Down at the archery
                        fields, Chiron
                        was conducting target practice. I knew he’d be the best person to talk to. Maybe he could give
                        me some advice,
                        but something held me back. I had a feeling Chiron would try to protect me, like he always did.
                        He might not
                        tell me everything he knew. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked the other direction. At the top of Half-Blood Hill, Mr. D and Argus
                        were feeding the
                        baby dragon that guarded the Golden Fleece. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then it occurred to me: no one would be in the Big House. There was someone
                        else…some<i class="calibre5">thing </i>else I could ask for guidance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My blood was humming in my ears as I ran into the house and took the stairs.
                        I’d only done this
                        once before, and I still had nightmares about it. I opened the trap door and stepped into the
                        attic. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The room was dark and dusty and cluttered with junk, just like I remembered.
                        There were shields
                        with monster bites out of them, and swords bent in the shapes of daemon heads, and a bunch of
                        taxidermy, like a
                        stuffed harpy and a bright orange python. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Over by the window, sitting on a three-legged stool, was the shriveled-up mummy
                        of an old lady
                        in a tie-dyed hippie dress. The Oracle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I made myself walk toward her. I waited for green mist to billow from the
                        mummy’s mouth, like
                        it had before, but nothing happened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hi,” I said. “Uh, what’s up?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I winced at how stupid that sounded. Not much could be “up” when you’re dead
                        and stuck in the
                        attic. But I knew the spirit of the Oracle was in there somewhere. I could feel a cold presence
                        in the room,
                        like a coiled sleeping snake. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I have a question,” I said a little louder. “I need to know about Annabeth.
                        How can I save
                        her?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">No answer. The sun slanted through the dirty attic window, lighting the dust
                        motes dancing in
                        the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I waited longer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Then I got angry. I was being stonewalled by a corpse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right,” I said. “Fine. I’ll figure it out myself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned and bumped into a big table full of souvenirs. It seemed more
                        cluttered than the last
                        time I was here. Heroes stored all kinds of stuff in the attic: quest trophies they no longer
                        wanted to keep in
                        their cabins, or stuff that held painful memories. I knew Luke had stored a dragon claw
                        somewhere up here—the
                        one that had scarred his face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There was a broken sword hilt labeled: <i class="calibre5">This broke and Leroy
                            got killed.
                            1999. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I noticed a pink silk scarf with a label attached to it. I picked up the
                        tag and tried to
                        read it: </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">I stared at the scarf. I’d totally forgotten about it. Two years ago, Annabeth
                        had ripped this
                        scarf out of my hands and said something like, <i class="calibre5">Oh, no. No love magic for
                            you! </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I’d just assumed she’d thrown it away. And yet here it was. She’d kept it all
                        this time? And
                        why had she stashed it in the attic? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I turned to the mummy. She hadn’t moved, but the shadows across her face made
                        it look like she
                        was smiling gruesomely. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I dropped the scarf and tried not to run toward the exit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">That night after dinner, I was seriously ready to beat the Hunters at capture
                        the flag. It was
                        going to be a small game: only thirteen Hunters, including Bianca di Angelo, and about the same
                        number of
                        campers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë Nightshade looked pretty upset. She kept glancing resentfully at Chiron,
                        like she couldn’t
                        believe he was making her do this. The other Hunters didn’t look too happy, either. Unlike last
                        night, they
                        weren’t laughing or joking around. They just huddled together in the dining pavilion, whispering
                        nervously to
                        each other as they strapped on their armor. Some of them even looked like they’d been crying. I
                        guess Zoë had
                        told them about her nightmare. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">On our team, we had Beckendorf and two other Hephaestus guys, a few from the
                        Ares cabin (though
                        it still seemed strange that Clarisse wasn’t around), the Stoll brothers and Nico from Hermes
                        cabin, and a few
                        Aphrodite kids. It was weird that the Aphrodite cabin wanted to play. Usually they sat on the
                        sidelines,
                        chatted, and checked their reflections in the river and stuff, but when they heard we were
                        fighting the Hunters,
                        they were raring to go. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll show them ‘love is worthless,’” Silena Beauregard grumbled as she
                        strapped on her armor.
                        “I’ll pulverize them!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">That left Thalia and me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’ll take the offense,” Thalia volunteered. “You take defense.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh.” I hesitated, because I’d been about to say the exact same thing, only
                        reversed. “Don’t
                        you think with your shield and all, you’d be better defense?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia already had Aegis on her arm, and even our own teammates were giving her
                        a wide berth,
                        trying not to cower before the bronze head of Medusa. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well, I was thinking it would make better offense,” Thalia said. “Besides,
                        you’ve had more
                        practice at defense.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I wasn’t sure if she was teasing me. I’d had some pretty bad experiences with
                        defense on
                        capture the flag. My first year, Annabeth had put me out as a kind of bait, and I’d almost been
                        gored to death
                        with spears and killed by a hellhound. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, no problem,” I lied. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Cool.” Thalia turned to help some of the Aphrodite kids, who were having
                        trouble suiting up
                        their armor without breaking their nails. Nico di Angelo ran up to me with a big grin on his
                        face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy, this is awesome!” His blue-feathered bronze helmet was falling in his
                        eyes, and his
                        breastplate was about six sizes too big. I wondered if there was any way I’d looked that
                        ridiculous when I’d
                        first arrived. Unfortunately, I probably had. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Nico lifted his sword with effort. “Do we get to kill the other team?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/6-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well…no.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But the Hunters are immortal, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That’s only if they don’t fall in battle. Besides—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It would be awesome if we just, like, resurrected as soon as we were killed,
                        so we could keep
                        fighting, and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nico, this is serious. Real swords. These can hurt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He stared at me, a little disappointed, and I realized that I’d just sounded
                        like my mother.
                        Whoa. Not a good sign. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I patted Nico on the shoulder. “Hey, it’s cool. Just follow the team. Stay out
                        of Zoë’s way.
                        We’ll have a blast.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Chiron’s hoof thundered on the pavilion floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Heroes!” he called. “You know the rules! The creek is the boundary line. Blue
                        team—Camp
                        Half-Blood—shall take the west woods. Hunters of Artemis—red team—shall take the east woods. I
                        will serve as
                        referee and battlefield medic. No intentional maiming, please! All magic items are allowed. To
                        your positions!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sweet,” Nico whispered next to me. “What kind of magic items? Do I get one?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was about to break it to him that he didn’t, when Thalia said, “Blue team!
                        Follow me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They cheered and followed. I had to run to catch up, and tripped over
                        somebody’s shield, so I
                        didn’t look much like a co-captain. More like an idiot. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">We set our flag at the top of Zeus’s Fist. It’s this cluster of boulders in the
                        middle of the
                        west woods that, if you look at it just the right way, looks like a huge fist sticking out of
                        the ground. If you
                        look at it from any other side, it looks like a pile of enormous deer droppings, but Chiron
                        wouldn’t let us call
                        the place the Poop Pile, especially after it had been named for Zeus, who doesn’t have much of a
                        sense of humor.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Anyway, it was a good place to set the flag. The top boulder was twenty feet
                        tall and really
                        hard to climb, so the flag was clearly visible, like the rules said it had to be, and it didn’t
                        matter that the
                        guards weren’t allowed to stand within ten yards of it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I set Nico on guard duty with Beckendorf and the Stoll brothers, figuring he’d
                        be safely out of
                        the way. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’ll send out a decoy to the left,” Thalia told the team. “Silena, you lead
                        that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Got it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Take Laurel and Jason. They’re good runners. Make a wide arc around the
                        Hunters, attract as
                        many as you can. I’ll take the main raiding party around to the right and catch them by
                        surprise.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everybody nodded. It sounded good, and Thalia said it with such confidence you
                        couldn’t help
                        but believe it would work. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia looked at me. “Anything to add, Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, yeah. Keep sharp on defense. We’ve got four guards, two scouts. That’s not
                        much for a big
                        forest. I’ll be roving. Yell if you need help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“And don’t leave your post!” Thalia said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Unless you see a golden opportunity,” I added. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia scowled. “Just don’t leave your post.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right, unless—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” She touched my arm and shocked me. I mean, everybody can give static
                        shocks in the
                        winter, but when Thalia does, it hurts. I guess it’s because her dad is the god of lightning.
                        She’s been known
                        to fry off people’s eyebrows. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-3-scenes/6-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry,” Thalia said, though she didn’t sound particularly sorry. “Now, is
                        everybody clear?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Everybody nodded. We broke into our smaller groups. The horn sounded, and the
                        game began. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Silena’s group disappeared into the woods on the left. Thalia’s group gave it a
                        few seconds,
                        then darted off toward the right. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I waited for something to happen. I climbed Zeus’s Fist and had a good view
                        over the forest. I
                        remembered how the Hunters had stormed out of the woods when they fought the manticore, and I
                        was prepared for
                        something like that—one huge charge that could overwhelm us. But nothing happened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I caught a glimpse of Silena and her two scouts. They ran through a clearing,
                        followed by five
                        of the Hunters, leading them deep into the woods and away from Thalia. The plan seemed to be
                        working. Then I
                        spotted another clump of Hunters heading to the right, bows ready. They must’ve spotted Thalia.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What’s happening?” Nico demanded, trying to climb up next to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mind was racing. Thalia would never get through, but the Hunters were
                        divided. With that
                        many on either flank, their center had to be wide open. If I moved fast…</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked at Beckendorf. “Can you guys hold the fort?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Beckendorf snorted. “Of course.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m going in.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Stoll brothers and Nico cheered as I raced toward the boundary line. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was running at top speed and I felt great. I leaped over the creek into enemy
                        territory. I
                        could see their silver flag up ahead, only one guard, who wasn’t even looking in my direction. I
                        heard fighting
                        to my left and right, somewhere in the woods. I had it made. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The guard turned at the last minute. It was Bianca di Angelo. Her eyes widened
                        as I slammed
                        into her and she went sprawling in the snow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry!” I yelled. I ripped down the silver silk flag from the tree and took
                        off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was ten yards away before Bianca managed to yell for help. I thought I was
                        home free. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">ZIP! </i>A silvery cord raced across my ankles and fastened
                        to the tree
                        next to me. A trip wire, fired from a bow! Before I could even think about stopping, I went down
                        hard, sprawling
                        in the snow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Thalia yelled, off to my left. “What are you <i
                            class="calibre5">doing</i>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before she reached me, an arrow exploded at her feet and a cloud of yellow
                        smoke billowed
                        around her team. They started coughing and gagging. I could smell the gas from across the
                        woods—the horrible
                        smell of sulfur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No fair!” Thalia gasped. “Fart arrows are unsportsmanlike!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I got up and started running again. Only a few more yards to the creek and I
                        had the game. More
                        arrows whizzed past my ears. A Hunter came out of nowhere and slashed at me with her knife, but
                        I parried and
                        kept running. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I heard yelling from our side of the creek. Beckendorf and Nico were running
                        toward me. I
                        thought they were coming to welcome me back, but then I saw they were chasing someone—Zoë
                        Nightshade, racing
                        toward me like a cheetah, dodging campers with no trouble. And she had our flag in her hands.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                    <p class="calibre13">“No!” I yelled, and poured on the speed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was two feet from the water when Zoë bolted across to her own side, slamming
                        into me for good
                        measure. The Hunters cheered as both sides converged on the creek. Chiron appeared out of the
                        woods, looking
                        grim. He had the Stoll brothers on his back, and it looked as if both of them had taken some
                        nasty whacks to the
                        head. Connor Stoll had two arrows sticking out of his helmet like antennae. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“The Hunters win!” Chiron announced without pleasure. Then he muttered, “For
                        the fifty-sixth
                        time in a row.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Perseus Jackson!” Thalia yelled, storming toward me. She smelled like rotten
                        eggs, and she was
                        so mad that blue sparks flickered on her armor. Everybody cringed and backed up because of
                        Aegis. It took all my
                        willpower not to cower. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What in the name of the gods were you THINKING?” she bellowed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I balled my fists. I’d had enough bad stuff happen to me for one day. I didn’t
                        need this. “I
                        got the flag, Thalia!” I shook it in her face. “I saw a chance and I took it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I WAS AT THEIR BASE!” Thalia yelled. “But the flag was gone. If you hadn’t
                        butted in, we
                        would’ve won.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You had too many on you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, so it’s my fault?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I didn’t say that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Argh!” Thalia pushed me, and a shock went through my body that blew me
                        backward ten feet into
                        the water. Some of the campers gasped. A couple of the Hunters stifled laughs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Sorry!” Thalia said, turning pale. “I didn’t mean to—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Anger roared in my ears. A wave erupted from the creek, blasting into Thalia’s
                        face and dousing
                        her from head to toe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I stood up. “Yeah,” I growled. “I didn’t mean to, either.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia was breathing heavily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Enough!” Chiron ordered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">But Thalia held out her spear. “You want some, Seaweed Brain?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Somehow, it was okay when Annabeth called me that—at least, I’d gotten used to
                        it—but hearing
                        it from Thalia was not cool. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Bring it on, Pinecone Face!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I raised Riptide, but before I could even defend myself, Thalia yelled, and a
                        blast of
                        lightning came down from the sky, hit her spear like a lightning rod, and slammed into my chest.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I sat down hard. There was a burning smell; I had a feeling it was my clothes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thalia!” Chiron said. “That is <i class="calibre5">enough</i>!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I got to my feet and willed the entire creek to rise. It swirled up, hundreds
                        of gallons of
                        water in a massive icy funnel cloud. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Percy!” Chiron pleaded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I was about to hurl it at Thalia when I saw something in the woods. I lost my
                        anger and my
                        concentration all at once. The water splashed back into the creekbed. Thalia was so surprised
                        she turned to see
                        what I was looking at. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Someone…something was approaching. It was shrouded in a murky green mist, but
                        as it got closer,
                        the campers and Hunters gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“This is impossible,” Chiron said. I’d never heard him sound so nervous.
                        “It…she has never left
                        the attic. Never.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">And yet, the withered mummy that held the Oracle shuffled forward until she
                        stood in the center
                        of the group. Mist curled around our feet, turning the snow a sickly shade of green. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">None of us dared move. Then her voice hissed inside my head. Apparently
                        everyone could hear it,
                        because several clutched their hands over the ears. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">I am the spirit of Delphi, </i>the voice said. <i
                            class="calibre5">Speaker
                            of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo, slayer of the mighty Python</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Oracle regarded me with its cold, dead eyes. Then she turned unmistakably
                        toward Zoë
                        Nightshade. <i class="calibre5">Approach, Seeker, and ask. </i></p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Zoë swallowed. “What must I do to help my goddess?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The Oracle’s mouth opened, and green mist poured out. I saw the vague image of
                        a mountain, and
                        a girl standing at the barren peak. It was Artemis, but she was wrapped in chains, fettered to
                        the rocks. She
                        was kneeling, her hands raised as if to fend off an attacker, and it looked like she was in
                        pain. The Oracle
                        spoke: </p>
                    <blockquote class="calibre16">
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Five shall go west to the goddess in chains, </i></p>
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">One shall be lost in the land without rain, </i></p>
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">The bane of Olympus shows the trail, </i></p>
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">Campers and Hunters combined prevail, </i></p>
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">The Titan’s curse must one withstand, </i></p>
                        <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">And one shall perish by a parent’s hand. </i></p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p class="calibre13">Then, as we were watching, the mist swirled and retreated like a great green
                        serpent into the
                        mummy’s mouth. The Oracle sat down on a rock and became as still as she’d been in the attic, as
                        if she might sit
                        by this creek for a hundred years. </p>
