                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The Friday before winter break, my mom packed me an overnight bag and a few
                        deadly weapons and
                        took me to a new boarding school. We picked up my friends Annabeth and Thalia on the way. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was an eight-hour drive from New York to Bar Harbor, Maine. Sleet and snow
                        pounded the
                        highway. Annabeth, Thalia, and I hadn’t seen each other in months, but between the blizzard and
                        the thought of
                        what we were about to do, we were too nervous to talk much. Except for my mom. She talks <i
                            class="calibre5">more </i>when she’s nervous. By the time we finally got to Westover Hall,
                        it was getting
                        dark, and she’d told Annabeth and Thalia every embarrassing baby story there was to tell about
                        me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia wiped the fog off the car window and peered outside. “Oh, yeah. This’ll
                        be fun.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Westover Hall looked like an evil knight’s castle. It was all black stone, with
                        towers and slit
                        windows and a big set of wooden double doors. It stood on a snowy cliff overlooking this big
                        frosty forest on
                        one side and the gray churning ocean on the other. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Are you sure you don’t want me to wait?” my mother asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“No, thanks, Mom,” I said. “I don’t know how long it will take. We’ll be okay.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But how will you get back? I’m worried, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I hoped I wasn’t blushing. It was bad enough I had to depend on my mom to drive
                        me to my
                        battles. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s okay, Ms. Jackson.” Annabeth smiled reassuringly. Her blond hair was
                        tucked into a ski
                        cap and her gray eyes were the same color as the ocean. “We’ll keep him out of trouble.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My mom seemed to relax a little. She thinks Annabeth is the most levelheaded
                        demigod ever to
                        hit eighth grade. She’s sure Annabeth often keeps me from getting killed. She’s right, but that
                        doesn’t mean I
                        have to like it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All right, dears,” my mom said. “Do you have everything you need?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, Ms. Jackson,” Thalia said. “Thanks for the ride.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Extra sweaters? You have my cell phone number?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mom—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Your ambrosia and nectar, Percy? And a golden drachma in case you need to
                        contact camp?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Mom, seriously! We’ll be fine. Come on, guys.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She looked a little hurt, and I was sorry about that, but I was ready to be out
                        of that car. If
                        my mom told one more story about how cute I looked in the bathtub when I was three years old, I
                        was going to
                        burrow into the snow and freeze myself to death. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and Thalia followed me outside. The wind blew straight through my coat
                        like ice
                        daggers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Once my mother’s car was out of sight, Thalia said, “Your mom is so cool,
                        Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“She’s pretty okay,” I admitted. “What about you? You ever get in touch with
                        your mom?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">As soon as I said it, I wished I hadn’t. Thalia was great at giving evil looks,
                        what with the
                        punk clothes she always wears—the ripped-up army jacket, black leather pants and chain jewelry,
                        the black
                        eyeliner and those intense blue eyes. But the look she gave me now was a perfect evil “ten.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“If that was any of your business, Percy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’d better get inside,” Annabeth interrupted. “Grover will be waiting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia looked at the castle and shivered. “You’re right. I wonder what he found
                        here that made
                        him send the distress call.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared up at the dark towers of Westover Hall. “Nothing good,” I guessed.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The oak doors groaned open, and the three of us stepped into the entry hall in
                        a swirl of snow.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">All I could say was, “Whoa.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The place was huge. The walls were lined with battle flags and weapon displays:
                        antique rifles,
                        battle axes, and a bunch of other stuff. I mean, I knew Westover was a military school and all,
                        but the
                        decorations seemed like overkill. Literally. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">My hand went to my pocket, where I kept my lethal ballpoint pen, Riptide. I
                        could already sense
                        something wrong in this place. Something dangerous. Thalia was rubbing her silver bracelet, her
                        favorite magic
                        item. I knew we were thinking the same thing. A fight was coming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth started to say, “I wonder where—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The doors slammed shut behind us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oo-kay,” I mumbled. “Guess we’ll stay a while.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I could hear music echoing from the other end of the hall. It sounded like
                        dance music. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We stashed our overnight bags behind a pillar and started down the hall. We
                        hadn’t gone very
                        far when I heard footsteps on the stone floor, and a man and woman marched out of the shadows to
                        intercept us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They both had short gray hair and black military-style uniforms with red trim.
                        The woman had a
                        wispy mustache, and the guy was clean-shaven, which seemed kind of backward to me. They both
                        walked stiffly,
                        like they had broomsticks taped to their spines. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well?” the woman demanded. “What are you doing here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um…” I realized I hadn’t planned for this. I’d been so focused on getting to
                        Grover and
                        finding out what was wrong, I hadn’t considered that someone might question three kids sneaking
                        into the school
                        at night. We hadn’t talked at all in the car about how we would get inside. I said, “Ma’am,
                        we’re just—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Ha!” the man snapped, which made me jump. “Visitors are not allowed at the
                        dance! You shall be
                        <i class="calibre5">eee-jected</i>!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He had an accent—French, maybe. He pronounced his <i class="calibre5">J
                        </i>like in <i class="calibre5">Jacques</i>. He was tall, with a hawkish face. His nostrils
                        flared when he spoke, which
                        made it really hard not to stare up his nose, and his eyes were two different colors—one brown,
                        one blue—like an
                        alley cat’s. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I figured he was about to toss us into the snow, but then Thalia stepped
                        forward and did
                        something very weird. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She snapped her fingers. The sound was sharp and loud. Maybe it was just my
                        imagination, but I
                        felt a gust of wind ripple out from her hand, across the room. It washed over all of us, making
                        the banners
                        rustle on the walls. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh, but we’re not visitors, sir,” Thalia said. “We go to school here. You
                        remember: I’m
                        Thalia. And this is Annabeth and Percy. We’re in the eighth grade.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The male teacher narrowed his two-colored eyes. I didn’t know what Thalia was
                        thinking. Now
                        we’d probably get punished for lying <i class="calibre5">and </i>thrown into the snow. But the
                        man seemed to be
                        hesitating. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked at his colleague. “Ms. Gottschalk, do you know these students?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Despite the danger we were in, I had to bite my tongue to keep from laughing. A
                        teacher named
                        <i class="calibre5">Got Chalk</i>? He had to be kidding.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The woman blinked, like someone had just woken her up from a trance. “I…yes. I
                        believe I do,
                        sir.” She frowned at us. “Annabeth. Thalia. Percy. What are you doing away from the gymnasium?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Before we could answer, I heard more footsteps, and Grover ran up, breathless.
                        “You made it!
                        You—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He stopped short when he saw the teachers. “Oh, Mrs. Gottschalk. Dr. Thorn! I,
                        uh—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What <i class="calibre5">is </i>it, Mr. Underwood?” said the man. His tone
                        made it clear that
                        he detested Grover. “What do you mean, they made it? These students live here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover swallowed. “Yes, sir. Of course, Dr. Thorn. I just meant, I’m so glad
                        they made…the
                        punch for the dance! The punch is great. And they made it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Dr. Thorn glared at us. I decided one of his eyes had to be fake. The brown
                        one? The blue one?
                        He looked like he wanted to pitch us off the castle’s highest tower, but then Mrs. Gottschalk
                        said dreamily,
                        “Yes, the punch is excellent. Now run along, all of you. You are not to leave the gymnasium
                        again!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We didn’t wait to be told twice. We left with a lot of “Yes, ma’ams” and “Yes,
                        sirs” and a
                        couple of salutes, just because it seemed like the thing to do. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover hustled us down the hall in the direction of the music. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I could feel the teachers’ eyes on my back, but I walked closely to Thalia and
                        asked in a low
                        voice, “How did you do that finger-snap thing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You mean the Mist? Hasn’t Chiron shown you how to do that yet?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">An uncomfortable lump formed in my throat. Chiron was our head trainer at camp,
                        but he’d never
                        shown me anything like that. Why had he shown Thalia and not me? </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover hurried us to a door that had <small class="calibre4">GYM</small>
                        written on the glass.
                        Even with my dyslexia, I could read that much. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“That was close!” Grover said. “Thank the gods you got here!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth and Thalia both hugged Grover. I gave him a big high five. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">It was good to see him after so many months. He’d gotten a little taller and
                        had sprouted a few
                        more whiskers, but otherwise he looked like he always did when he passed for human—a red cap on
                        his curly brown
                        hair to hide his goat horns, baggy jeans and sneakers with fake feet to hide his furry legs and
                        hooves. He was
                        wearing a black T-shirt that took me a few seconds to read. It said <small
                            class="calibre4">WESTOVER HALL:
                            GRUNT</small>. I wasn’t sure whether that was, like, Grover’s rank or maybe just the school
                        motto. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So what’s the emergency?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover took a deep breath. “I found two.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Two half-bloods?” Thalia asked, amazed. “Here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Finding one half-blood was rare enough. This year, Chiron had put the satyrs on
                        emergency
                        overtime and sent them all over the country, scouring schools from fourth grade through high
                        school for possible
                        recruits. These were desperate times. We were losing campers. We needed all the new fighters we
                        could find. The
                        problem was, there just weren’t that many demigods out there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“A brother and a sister,” he said. “They’re ten and twelve. I don’t know their
                        parentage, but
                        they’re strong. We’re running out of time, though. I need help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Monsters?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“One.” Grover looked nervous. “He suspects. I don’t think he’s positive yet,
                        but this is the
                        last day of term. I’m sure he won’t let them leave campus without finding out. It may be our
                        last chance! Every
                        time I try to get close to them, he’s always there, blocking me. I don’t know what to do!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked at Thalia desperately. I tried not to feel upset by that. Used to
                        be, Grover
                        looked to me for answers, but Thalia had seniority. Not just because her dad was Zeus. Thalia
                        had more
                        experience than any of us with fending off monsters in the real world. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Right,” she said. “These half-bloods are at the dance?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Then let’s dance,” Thalia said. “Who’s the monster?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh,” Grover said, and looked around nervously. “You just met him. The vice
                        principal, Dr.
                        Thorn.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">Weird thing about military schools: the kids go absolutely nuts when there’s a
                        special event
                        and they get to be out of uniform. I guess it’s because everything’s so strict the rest of the
                        time, they feel
                        like they’ve got to overcompensate or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">There were black and red balloons all over the gym floor, and guys were kicking
                        them in each
                        other’s faces, or trying to strangle each other with the crepe-paper streamers taped to the
                        walls. Girls moved
                        around in football huddles, the way they always do, wearing lots of makeup and spaghetti-strap
                        tops and brightly
                        colored pants and shoes that looked like torture devices. Every once in a while they’d surround
                        some poor guy
                        like a pack of piranhas, shrieking and giggling, and when they finally moved on, the guy would
                        have ribbons in
                        his hair and a bunch of lipstick graffiti all over his face. Some of the older guys looked more
                        like
                        me—uncomfortable, hanging out at the edges of the gym and trying to hide, like any minute they
                        might have to
                        fight for their lives. Of course, in my case, it was true.…</p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“There they are.” Grover nodded toward a couple of younger kids arguing in the
                        bleachers.
                        “Bianca and Nico di Angelo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The girl wore a floppy green cap, like she was trying to hide her face. The boy
                        was obviously
                        her little brother. They both had dark silky hair and olive skin, and they used their hands a
                        lot as they
                        talked. The boy was shuffling some kind of trading cards. His sister seemed to be scolding him
                        about something.
                        She kept looking around like she sensed something was wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth said, “Do they…I mean, have you told them?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover shook his head. “You know how it is. That could put them in more danger.
                        Once they
                        realize who they are, their scent becomes stronger.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">He looked at me, and I nodded. I’d never really understood what half-bloods
                        “smell” like to
                        monsters and satyrs, but I knew that your scent could get you killed. And the more powerful a
                        demigod you
                        became, the more you smelled like a monster’s lunch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So let’s grab them and get out of here,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I started forward, but Thalia put her hand on my shoulder. The vice principal,
                        Dr. Thorn, had
                        slipped out of a doorway near the bleachers and was standing near the di Angelo siblings. He
                        nodded coldly in
                        our direction. His blue eye seemed to glow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Judging from his expression, I guessed Thorn hadn’t been fooled by Thalia’s
                        trick with the Mist
                        after all. He suspected who we were. He was just waiting to see why we were here. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Don’t look at the kids,” Thalia ordered. “We have to wait for a chance to get
                        them. We need to
                        pretend we’re not interested in them. Throw him off the scent.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“How?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We’re three powerful half-bloods. Our presence should confuse him. Mingle. Act
                        natural. Do
                        some dancing. But keep an eye on those kids.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dancing?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Thalia nodded. She cocked her ear to the music and made a face. “Ugh. Who chose
                        the Jesse
                        McCartney?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover looked hurt. “I did.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh my gods, Grover. That is so lame. Can’t you play, like, Green Day or
                        something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Green who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Never mind. Let’s dance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“But I can’t dance!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“You can if I’m leading,” Thalia said. “Come on, goat boy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Grover yelped as Thalia grabbed his hand and led him onto the dance floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth smiled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Nothing. It’s just cool to have Thalia back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth had grown taller than me since last summer, which I found kind of
                        disturbing. She used
                        to wear no jewelry except for her Camp Half-Blood bead necklace, but now she wore little silver
                        earrings shaped
                        like owls—the symbol of her mother, Athena. She pulled off her ski cap, and her long blond hair
                        tumbled down her
                        shoulders. It made her look older, for some reason. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So…” I tried to think of something to say. <i class="calibre5">Act
                            natural</i>, Thalia had
                        told us. When you’re a half-blood on a dangerous mission, what the heck is natural? “Um, design
                        any good
                        buildings lately?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth’s eyes lit up, the way they always did when she talked about
                        architecture. “Oh my
                        gods, Percy. At my new school, I get to take 3-D design as an elective, and there’s this cool
                        computer program…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She went on to explain how she’d designed this huge monument that she wanted to
                        build at Ground
                        Zero in Manhattan. She talked about structural supports and facades and stuff, and I tried to
                        listen. I knew she
                        wanted to be a super architect when she grew up—she loves math and historical buildings and all
                        that—but I
                        hardly understood a word she was saying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The truth was I was kind of disappointed to hear that she liked her new school
                        so much. It was
                        the first time she’d gone to school in New York. I’d been hoping to see her more often. It was a
                        boarding school
                        in Brooklyn, and she and Thalia were both attending, close enough to Camp Half-Blood that Chiron
                        could help if
                        they got in any trouble. Because it was an all-girls school, and I was going to MS-54 in
                        Manhattan, I hardly
                        ever saw them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yeah, uh, cool,” I said. “So you’re staying there the rest of the year, huh?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Her face got dark. “Well, maybe, if I don’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Hey!” Thalia called to us. She was slow dancing with Grover, who was tripping
                        all over
                        himself, kicking Thalia in the shins, and looking like he wanted to die. At least his feet were
                        fake. Unlike me,
                        he had an excuse for being clumsy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Dance, you guys!” Thalia ordered. “You look stupid just standing there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I looked nervously at Annabeth, then at the groups of girls who were roaming
                        the gym. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Well?” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Um, who should I ask?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She punched me in the gut. “<i class="calibre5">Me</i>, Seaweed Brain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh. Oh, right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">So we went onto the dance floor, and I looked over to see how Thalia and Grover
                        were doing
                        things. I put one hand on Annabeth’s hip, and she clasped my other hand like she was about to
                        judo throw me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“I’m not going to bite,” she told me. “Honestly, Percy. Don’t you guys have
                        dances at your
                        school?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I didn’t answer. The truth was we did. But I’d never, like, actually <i
                            class="calibre5">danced
                        </i>at one. I was usually one of the guys playing basketball in the corner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">We shuffled around for a few minutes. I tried to concentrate on little things,
                        like the
                        crepe-paper streamers and the punch bowl—anything but the fact that Annabeth was taller than me,
                        and my hands
                        were sweaty and probably gross, and I kept stepping on her toes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What were you saying earlier?” I asked. “Are you having trouble at school or
                        something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She pursed her lips. “It’s not that. It’s my dad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Uh-oh.” I knew Annabeth had a rocky relationship with her father. “I thought
                        it was getting
                        better with you two. Is it your stepmom again?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth sighed. “He decided to move. Just when I was getting settled in New
                        York, he took this
                        stupid new job researching for a World War I book. In <i class="calibre5">San Francisco</i>.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She said this the same way she might say <i class="calibre5">Fields of
                            Punishment </i>or <i class="calibre5">Hades’s gym shorts</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“So he wants you to move out there with him?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“To the other side of the country,” she said miserably. “And half-bloods can’t
                        live in San
                        Francisco. He should know that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What? Why not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Annabeth rolled her eyes. Maybe she thought I was kidding. “You know. It’s
                        right <i class="calibre5">there</i>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Oh,” I said. I had no idea what she was talking about, but I didn’t want to
                        sound stupid.
                        “So…you’ll go back to living at camp or what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“It’s more serious than that, Percy. I…I probably should tell you something.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Suddenly she froze. “They’re gone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I followed her gaze. The bleachers. The two half-blood kids, Bianca and Nico,
                        were no longer
                        there. The door next to the bleachers was wide open. Dr. Thorn was nowhere in sight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“We have to get Thalia and Grover!” Annabeth looked around frantically. “Oh,
                        where’d they dance
                        off to? Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">She ran through the crowd. I was about to follow when a mob of girls got in my
                        way. I
                        maneuvered around them to avoid getting the ribbon-and-lipstick treatment, and by the time I was
                        free, Annabeth
                        had disappeared. I turned a full circle, looking for her or Thalia and Grover. Instead, I saw
                        something that
                        chilled my blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">About fifty feet away, lying on the gym floor, was a floppy green cap just like
                        the one Bianca
                        di Angelo had been wearing. Near it were a few scattered trading cards. Then I caught a glimpse
                        of Dr. Thorn. He
                        was hurrying out a door at the opposite end of the gym, steering the di Angelo kids by the
                        scruffs of their
                        necks, like kittens. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I still couldn’t see Annabeth, but I knew she’d be heading the other way,
                        looking for Thalia
                        and Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I almost ran after her, and then I thought, <i class="calibre5">Wait</i>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I remembered what Thalia had said to me in the entry hall, looking at me all
                        puzzled when I
                        asked about the finger-snap trick: <i class="calibre5">Hasn’t Chiron shown you how to do that
                            yet? </i>I thought
                        about the way Grover had turned to her, expecting her to save the day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Not that I resented Thalia. She was cool. It wasn’t her fault her dad was Zeus
                        and she got all
                        the attention.…Still, I didn’t need to run after her to solve every problem. Besides, there
                        wasn’t time. The di
                        Angelos were in danger. They might be long gone by the time I found my friends. I knew monsters.
                        I could handle
                        this myself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took Riptide out of my pocket and ran after Dr. Thorn.</p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="no-indent">The door led into a dark hallway. I heard sounds of scuffling up ahead, then a
                        painful grunt. I
                        uncapped Riptide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">The pen grew in my hands until I held a bronze Greek sword about three-feet
                        long with a
                        leather-bound grip. The blade glowed faintly, casting a golden light on the rows of lockers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I jogged down the corridor, but when I got to the other end, no one was there.
                        I opened a door
                        and found myself back in the main entry hall. I was completely turned around. I didn’t see Dr.
                        Thorn anywhere,
                        but there on the opposite side of the room were the di Angelo kids. They stood frozen in horror,
                        staring right
                        at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I advanced slowly, lowering the tip of my sword. “It’s okay. I’m not going to
                        hurt you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">They didn’t answer. Their eyes were full of fear. What was wrong with them?
                        Where was Dr.
                        Thorn? Maybe he’d sensed the presence of Riptide and retreated. Monsters hated celestial bronze
                        weapons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“My name’s Percy,” I said, trying to keep my voice level. “I’m going to take
                        you out of here,
                        get you somewhere safe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Bianca’s eyes widened. Her fists clenched. Only too late did I realize what her
                        look meant. She
                        wasn’t afraid of me. She was trying to warn me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I whirled around and something went <i class="calibre5">WHIIISH! </i>Pain
                        exploded in my
                        shoulder. A force like a huge hand yanked me backward and slammed me to the wall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I slashed with my sword but there was nothing to hit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A cold laugh echoed through the hall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Yes, Perseus <i class="calibre5">Jackson</i>,” Dr. Thorn said. His accent
                        mangled the <i class="calibre5">J </i>in my last name. “I know who you are.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to free my shoulder. My coat and shirt were pinned to the wall by some
                        kind of spike—a
                        black dagger-like projectile about a foot long. It had grazed the skin of my shoulder as it
                        passed through my
                        clothes, and the cut burned. I’d felt something like this before. Poison. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I forced myself to concentrate. I would <i class="calibre5">not </i>pass out.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">A dark silhouette now moved toward us. Dr. Thorn stepped into the dim light. He
                        still looked
                        human, but his face was ghoulish. He had perfect white teeth and his brown/blue eyes reflected
                        the light of my
                        sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“Thank you for coming out of the gym,” he said. “I hate middle school dances.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">I tried to swing my sword again, but he was just out of reach. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13"><i class="calibre5">WHIIIISH! </i>A second projectile shot from somewhere
                        behind Dr. Thorn. He
                        didn’t appear to move. It was as if someone invisible were standing behind him, throwing knives.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">Next to me, Bianca yelped. The second thorn impaled itself in the stone wall,
                        half an inch from
                        her face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre13">“All three of you will come with me,” Dr. Thorn said. “Quietly. Obediently. If
                        you make a
                        single noise, if you call out for help or try to fight, I will show you just how accurately I
                        can throw.” </p>
