                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">L</span>ook, I didn’t want to be a half-blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">If you’re reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is: close
                        this book right
                        now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal
                        life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Being a half-blood is dangerous. It’s scary. Most of the time, it gets you
                        killed in painful,
                        nasty ways. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">If you’re a normal kid, reading this because you think it’s fiction, great.
                        Read on. I envy you
                        for being able to believe that none of this ever happened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But if you recognize yourself in these pages—if you feel something stirring
                        inside—stop reading
                        immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it’s only a matter of time before
                        <em class="calibre5">they </em>sense it too, and they’ll come for you.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Don’t say I didn’t warn you. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">My name is Percy Jackson. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’m twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy
                        Academy, a
                        private school for troubled kids in upstate New York. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Am I a troubled kid? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Yeah. You could say that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could start at any point in my short miserable life to prove it, but things
                        really started
                        going bad last May, when our sixth-grade class took a field trip to Manhattan—twenty-eight
                        mental-case kids and
                        two teachers on a yellow school bus, heading to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to look at
                        ancient Greek and
                        Roman stuff. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I know—it sounds like torture. Most Yancy field trips were. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But Mr. Brunner, our Latin teacher, was leading this trip, so I had hopes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner was this middle-aged guy in a motorized wheelchair. He had thinning
                        hair and a
                        scruffy beard and a frayed tweed jacket, which always smelled like coffee. You wouldn’t think
                        he’d be cool, but
                        he told stories and jokes and let us play games in class. He also had this awesome collection of
                        Roman armor and
                        weapons, so he was the only teacher whose class didn’t put me to sleep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hoped the trip would be okay. At least, I hoped that for once I wouldn’t get
                        in trouble. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Boy, was I wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">See, bad things happen to me on field trips. Like at my fifth-grade school,
                        when we went to the
                        Saratoga battlefield, I had this accident with a Revolutionary War cannon. I wasn’t aiming for
                        the school bus,
                        but of course I got expelled anyway. And before that, at my fourth-grade school, when we took a
                        behind-the-scenes tour of the Marine World shark pool, I sort of hit the wrong lever on the
                        catwalk and our
                        class took an unplanned swim. And the time before that…Well, you get the idea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">This trip, I was determined to be good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All the way into the city, I put up with Nancy Bobofit, the freckly, redheaded
                        kleptomaniac
                        girl, hitting my best friend Grover in the back of the head with chunks of peanut
                        butter-and-ketchup sandwich.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was an easy target. He was scrawny. He cried when he got frustrated. He
                        must’ve been
                        held back several grades, because he was the only sixth grader with acne and the start of a
                        wispy beard on his
                        chin. On top of all that, he was crippled. He had a note excusing him from PE for the rest of
                        his life because
                        he had some kind of muscular disease in his legs. He walked funny, like every step hurt him, but
                        don’t let that
                        fool you. You should’ve seen him run when it was enchilada day in the cafeteria. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Anyway, Nancy Bobofit was throwing wads of sandwich that stuck in his curly
                        brown hair, and she
                        knew I couldn’t do anything back to her because I was already on probation. The headmaster had
                        threatened me
                        with death by in-school suspension if anything bad, embarrassing, or even mildly entertaining
                        happened on this
                        trip. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m going to kill her,” I mumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover tried to calm me down. “It’s okay. I like peanut butter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He dodged another piece of Nancy’s lunch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s it.” I started to get up, but Grover pulled me back to my seat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re already on probation,” he reminded me. “You know who’ll get blamed if
                        anything
                        happens.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Looking back on it, I wish I’d decked Nancy Bobofit right then and there.
                        In-school suspension
                        would’ve been nothing compared to the mess I was about to get myself into. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Mr. Brunner led the museum tour. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He rode up front in his wheelchair, guiding us through the big echoey
                        galleries, past marble
                        statues and glass cases full of really old black-and-orange pottery. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It blew my mind that this stuff had survived for two thousand, three thousand
                        years. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gathered us around a thirteen-foot-tall stone column with a big sphinx on
                        the top, and
                        started telling us how it was a grave marker, a <em class="calibre5">stele</em>, for a girl
                        about our age. He
                        told us about the carvings on the sides. I was trying to listen to what he had to say, because
                        it was kind of
                        interesting, but everybody around me was talking, and every time I told them to shut up, the
                        other teacher
                        chaperone, Mrs. Dodds, would give me the evil eye. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds was this little math teacher from Georgia who always wore a black
                        leather jacket,
                        even though she was fifty years old. She looked mean enough to ride a Harley right into your
                        locker. She had
                        come to Yancy halfway through the year, when our last math teacher had a nervous breakdown. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">From her first day, Mrs. Dodds loved Nancy Bobofit and figured I was devil
                        spawn. She would
                        point her crooked finger at me and say, “Now, honey,” real sweet, and I knew I was going to get
                        after-school
                        detention for a month. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">One time, after she’d made me erase answers out of old math workbooks until
                        midnight, I told
                        Grover I didn’t think Mrs. Dodds was human. He looked at me, real serious, and said, “You’re
                        absolutely right.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner kept talking about Greek funeral art. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, Nancy Bobofit snickered something about the naked guy on the stele,
                        and I turned
                        around and said, “Will you <em class="calibre5">shut up</em>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It came out louder than I meant it to. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The whole group laughed. Mr. Brunner stopped his story. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mr. Jackson,” he said, “did you have a comment?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My face was totally red. I said, “No, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner pointed to one of the pictures on the stele. “Perhaps you’ll tell
                        us what this
                        picture represents?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at the carving, and felt a flush of relief, because I actually
                        recognized it. “That’s
                        Kronos eating his kids, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes,” Mr. Brunner said, obviously not satisfied. “And he did this because…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well…” I racked my brain to remember. “Kronos was the king god, and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“God?” Mr. Brunner asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Titan,” I corrected myself. “And…he didn’t trust his kids, who were the gods.
                        So, um, Kronos
                        ate them, right? But his wife hid baby Zeus, and gave Kronos a rock to eat instead. And later,
                        when Zeus grew
                        up, he tricked his dad, Kronos, into barfing up his brothers and sisters—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Eeew!” said one of the girls behind me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“—and so there was this big fight between the gods and the Titans,” I
                        continued, “and the gods
                        won.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Some snickers from the group. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind me, Nancy Bobofit mumbled to a friend, “Like we’re going to use this in
                        real life. Like
                        it’s going to say on our job applications, ‘Please explain why Kronos ate his kids.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And why, Mr. Jackson,” Brunner said, “to paraphrase Miss Bobofit’s excellent
                        question, does
                        this matter in real life?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Busted,” Grover muttered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shut up,” Nancy hissed, her face even brighter red than her hair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At least Nancy got packed, too. Mr. Brunner was the only one who ever caught
                        her saying
                        anything wrong. He had radar ears. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about his question, and shrugged. “I don’t know, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“I see.” Mr. Brunner looked disappointed. “Well, half credit, Mr. Jackson. Zeus
                        did indeed feed
                        Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine, which made him disgorge his other five children, who, of
                        course, being
                        immortal gods, had been living and growing up completely undigested in the Titan’s stomach. The
                        gods defeated
                        their father, sliced him to pieces with his own scythe, and scattered his remains in Tartarus,
                        the darkest part
                        of the Underworld. On that happy note, it’s time for lunch. Mrs. Dodds, would you lead us back
                        outside?” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The class drifted off, the girls holding their stomachs, the guys pushing each
                        other around and
                        acting like doofuses. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and I were about to follow when Mr. Brunner said, “Mr. Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew that was coming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told Grover to keep going. Then I turned toward Mr. Brunner. “Sir?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner had this look that wouldn’t let you go—intense brown eyes that
                        could’ve been a
                        thousand years old and had seen everything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You must learn the answer to my question,” Mr. Brunner told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“About the Titans?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“About real life. And how your studies apply to it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What you learn from me,” he said, “is vitally important. I expect you to treat
                        it as such. I
                        will accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to get angry, this guy pushed me so hard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I mean, sure, it was kind of cool on tournament days, when he dressed up in a
                        suit of Roman
                        armor and shouted: “What ho!” and challenged us, sword-point against chalk, to run to the board
                        and name every
                        Greek and Roman person who had ever lived, and their mother, and what god they worshipped. But
                        Mr. Brunner
                        expected me to be as good as everybody else, despite the fact that I have dyslexia and attention
                        deficit
                        disorder and I had never made above a C– in my life. No—he didn’t expect me to be <em
                            class="calibre5">as
                            good</em>; he expected me to be <em class="calibre5">better</em>. And I just couldn’t learn
                        all those names
                        and facts, much less spell them correctly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I mumbled something about trying harder, while Mr. Brunner took one long sad
                        look at the stele,
                        like he’d been at this girl’s funeral. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He told me to go outside and eat my lunch. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The class gathered on the front steps of the museum, where we could watch the
                        foot traffic
                        along Fifth Avenue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Overhead, a huge storm was brewing, with clouds blacker than I’d ever seen over
                        the city. I
                        figured maybe it was global warming or something, because the weather all across New York state
                        had been weird
                        since Christmas. We’d had massive snow storms, flooding, wildfires from lightning strikes. I
                        wouldn’t have been
                        surprised if this was a hurricane blowing in. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody else seemed to notice. Some of the guys were pelting pigeons with
                        Lunchables crackers.
                        Nancy Bobofit was trying to pickpocket something from a lady’s purse, and, of course, Mrs. Dodds
                        wasn’t seeing a
                        thing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and I sat on the edge of the fountain, away from the others. We thought
                        that maybe if we
                        did that, everybody wouldn’t know we were from <em class="calibre5">that </em>school—the school
                        for loser freaks
                        who couldn’t make it elsewhere. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Detention?” Grover asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nah,” I said. “Not from Brunner. I just wish he’d lay off me sometimes. I
                        mean—I’m not a
                        genius.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover didn’t say anything for a while. Then, when I thought he was going to
                        give me some deep
                        philosophical comment to make me feel better, he said, “Can I have your apple?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t have much of an appetite, so I let him take it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I watched the stream of cabs going down Fifth Avenue, and thought about my
                        mom’s apartment,
                        only a little ways uptown from where we sat. I hadn’t seen her since Christmas. I wanted so bad
                        to jump in a
                        taxi and head home. She’d hug me and be glad to see me, but she’d be disappointed, too. She’d
                        send me right back
                        to Yancy, remind me that I had to try harder, even if this was my sixth school in six years and
                        I was probably
                        going to be kicked out again. I wouldn’t be able to stand that sad look she’d give me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner parked his wheelchair at the base of the handicapped ramp. He ate
                        celery while he
                        read a paperback novel. A red umbrella stuck up from the back of his chair, making it look like
                        a motorized café
                        table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to unwrap my sandwich when Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me
                        with her ugly
                        friends—I guess she’d gotten tired of stealing from the tourists—and dumped her half-eaten lunch
                        in Grover’s
                        lap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oops.” She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as
                        if somebody had
                        spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to stay cool. The school counselor had told me a million times, “Count
                        to ten, get
                        control of your temper.” But I was so mad my mind went blank. A wave roared in my ears. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I don’t remember touching her, but the next thing I knew, Nancy was sitting on
                        her butt in the
                        fountain, screaming, “Percy pushed me!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/1-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds materialized next to us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Some of the kids were whispering: “Did you see—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“—the water—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“—like it grabbed her—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what they were talking about. All I knew was that I was in
                        trouble again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As soon as Mrs. Dodds was sure poor little Nancy was okay, promising to get her
                        a new shirt at
                        the museum gift shop, etc., etc., Mrs. Dodds turned on me. There was a triumphant fire in her
                        eyes, as if I’d
                        done something she’d been waiting for all semester. “Now, honey—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know,” I grumbled. “A month erasing workbooks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That wasn’t the right thing to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come with me,” Mrs. Dodds said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait!” Grover yelped. “It was me. <em class="calibre5">I </em>pushed her.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at him, stunned. I couldn’t believe he was trying to cover for me.
                        Mrs. Dodds scared
                        Grover to death. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She glared at him so hard his whiskery chin trembled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t think so, Mr. Underwood,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You—<em class="calibre5">will</em>—stay—here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover looked at me desperately. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s okay, man,” I told him. “Thanks for trying.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Honey,” Mrs. Dodds barked at me. <em class="calibre5">“Now.” </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nancy Bobofit smirked. I gave her my deluxe I’ll-kill-you-later stare. Then I
                        turned to face
                        Mrs. Dodds, but she wasn’t there. She was standing at the museum entrance, way at the top of the
                        steps,
                        gesturing impatiently at me to come on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">How’d she get there so fast? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I have moments like that a lot, when my brain falls asleep or something, and
                        the next thing I
                        know I’ve missed something, as if a puzzle piece fell out of the universe and left me staring at
                        the blank place
                        behind it. The school counselor told me this was part of the ADHD, my brain misinterpreting
                        things. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t so sure. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I went after Mrs. Dodds. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Halfway up the steps, I glanced back at Grover. He was looking pale, cutting
                        his eyes between
                        me and Mr. Brunner, like he wanted Mr. Brunner to notice what was going on, but Mr. Brunner was
                        absorbed in his
                        novel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked back up. Mrs. Dodds had disappeared again. She was now inside the
                        building, at the end
                        of the entrance hall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Okay, I thought. She’s going to make me buy a new shirt for Nancy at the gift
                        shop. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But apparently that wasn’t the plan. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I followed her deeper into the museum. When I finally caught up to her, we were
                        back in the
                        Greek and Roman section. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Except for us, the gallery was empty. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds stood with her arms crossed in front of a big marble frieze of the
                        Greek gods. She
                        was making this weird noise in her throat, like growling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Even without the noise, I would’ve been nervous. It’s weird being alone with a
                        teacher,
                        especially Mrs. Dodds. Something about the way she looked at the frieze, as if she wanted to
                        pulverize it…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve been giving us problems, honey,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I did the safe thing. I said, “Yes, ma’am.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She tugged on the cuffs of her leather jacket. “Did you really think you would
                        get away with
                        it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The look in her eyes was beyond mad. It was evil. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She’s a teacher, I thought nervously. It’s not like she’s going to hurt me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “I’ll—I’ll try harder, ma’am.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder shook the building. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We are not fools, Percy Jackson,” Mrs. Dodds said. “It was only a matter of
                        time before we
                        found you out. Confess, and you will suffer less pain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what she was talking about. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All I could think of was that the teachers must’ve found the illegal stash of
                        candy I’d been
                        selling out of my dorm room. Or maybe they’d realized I got my essay on <em class="calibre5">Tom
                            Sawyer
                        </em>from the Internet without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my
                        grade. Or worse,
                        they were going to make me read the book. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well?” she demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ma’am, I don’t…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your time is up,” she hissed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then the weirdest thing happened. Her eyes began to glow like barbecue coals.
                        Her fingers
                        stretched, turning into talons. Her jacket melted into large, leathery wings. She wasn’t human.
                        She was a
                        shriveled hag with bat wings and claws and a mouth full of yellow fangs, and she was about to
                        slice me to
                        ribbons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then things got even stranger. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner, who’d been out in front of the museum a minute before, wheeled his
                        chair into the
                        doorway of the gallery, holding a pen in his hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What ho, Percy!” he shouted, and tossed the pen through the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds lunged at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">With a yelp, I dodged and felt talons slash the air next to my ear. I snatched
                        the ballpoint
                        pen out of the air, but when it hit my hand, it wasn’t a pen anymore. It was a sword—Mr.
                        Brunner’s bronze sword,
                        which he always used on tournament day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds spun toward me with a murderous look in her eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My knees were jelly. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the sword.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She snarled, “Die, honey!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And she flew straight at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Absolute terror ran through my body. I did the only thing that came naturally:
                        I swung the
                        sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The metal blade hit her shoulder and passed clean through her body as if she
                        were made of
                        water. <em class="calibre5">Hisss! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds was a sand castle in a power fan. She exploded into yellow powder,
                        vaporized on the
                        spot, leaving nothing but the smell of sulfur and a dying screech and a chill of evil in the
                        air, as if those
                        two glowing red eyes were still watching me. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">I was alone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a ballpoint pen in my hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner wasn’t there. Nobody was there but me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My hands were still trembling. My lunch must’ve been contaminated with magic
                        mushrooms or
                        something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Had I imagined the whole thing? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I went back outside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It had started to rain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was sitting by the fountain, a museum map tented over his head. Nancy
                        Bobofit was still
                        standing there, soaked from her swim in the fountain, grumbling to her ugly friends. When she
                        saw me, she said,
                        “I hope Mrs. Kerr whipped your butt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “Who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Our <em class="calibre5">teacher</em>. Duh!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked. We had no teacher named Mrs. Kerr. I asked Nancy what she was
                        talking about. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She just rolled her eyes and turned away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I asked Grover where Mrs. Dodds was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He said, “Who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But he paused first, and he wouldn’t look at me, so I thought he was messing
                        with me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not funny, man,” I told him. “This is serious.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder boomed overhead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I saw Mr. Brunner sitting under his red umbrella, reading his book, as if he’d
                        never moved.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I went over to him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked up, a little distracted. “Ah, that would be my pen. Please bring your
                        own writing
                        utensil in the future, Mr. Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I handed Mr. Brunner his pen. I hadn’t even realized I was still holding it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sir,” I said, “where’s Mrs. Dodds?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He stared at me blankly. “Who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The other chaperone. Mrs. Dodds. The pre-algebra teacher.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He frowned and sat forward, looking mildly concerned. “Percy, there is no Mrs.
                        Dodds on this
                        trip. As far as I know, there has never been a Mrs. Dodds at Yancy Academy. Are you feeling all
                        right?” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">I</span> was used to the occasional weird experience, but
                        usually they
                        were over quickly. This twenty-four/seven hallucination was more than I could handle. For the
                        rest of the school
                        year, the entire campus seemed to be playing some kind of trick on me. The students acted as if
                        they were
                        completely and totally convinced that Mrs. Kerr—a perky blond woman whom I’d never seen in my
                        life until she got
                        on our bus at the end of the field trip—had been our pre-algebra teacher since Christmas. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Every so often I would spring a Mrs. Dodds reference on somebody, just to see
                        if I could trip
                        them up, but they would stare at me like I was psycho. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It got so I almost believed them—Mrs. Dodds had never existed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Almost. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But Grover couldn’t fool me. When I mentioned the name Dodds to him, he would
                        hesitate, then
                        claim she didn’t exist. But I knew he was lying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Something was going on. Something <em class="calibre5">had </em>happened at the
                        museum. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t have much time to think about it during the days, but at night,
                        visions of Mrs. Dodds
                        with talons and leathery wings would wake me up in a cold sweat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The freak weather continued, which didn’t help my mood. One night, a
                        thunderstorm blew out the
                        windows in my dorm room. A few days later, the biggest tornado ever spotted in the Hudson Valley
                        touched down
                        only fifty miles from Yancy Academy. One of the current events we studied in social studies
                        class was the
                        unusual number of small planes that had gone down in sudden squalls in the Atlantic that year.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I started feeling cranky and irritable most of the time. My grades slipped from
                        Ds to Fs. I got
                        into more fights with Nancy Bobofit and her friends. I was sent out into the hallway in almost
                        every class. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, when our English teacher, Mr. Nicoll, asked me for the millionth time
                        why I was too
                        lazy to study for spelling tests, I snapped. I called him an old sot. I wasn’t even sure what it
                        meant, but it
                        sounded good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The headmaster sent my mom a letter the following week, making it official: I
                        would not be
                        invited back next year to Yancy Academy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Fine, I told myself. Just fine. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was homesick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to be with my mom in our little apartment on the Upper East Side, even
                        if I had to go
                        to public school and put up with my obnoxious stepfather and his stupid poker parties. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And yet…there were things I’d miss at Yancy. The view of the woods out my dorm
                        window, the
                        Hudson River in the distance, the smell of pine trees. I’d miss Grover, who’d been a good
                        friend, even if he was
                        a little strange. I worried how he’d survive next year without me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d miss Latin class, too—Mr. Brunner’s crazy tournament days and his faith
                        that I could do
                        well. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">As exam week got closer, Latin was the only test I studied for. I hadn’t
                        forgotten what Mr.
                        Brunner had told me about this subject being life-and-death for me. I wasn’t sure why, but I’d
                        started to
                        believe him. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The evening before my final, I got so frustrated I threw the <em

                        circling my
                        head, the letters doing one-eighties as if they were riding skateboards. There was no way I was
                        going to
                        remember the difference between Chiron and Charon, or Polydictes and Polydeuces. And conjugating
                        those Latin
                        verbs? Forget it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I paced the room, feeling like ants were crawling around inside my shirt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I remembered Mr. Brunner’s serious expression, his thousand-year-old eyes. <em

                    <p class="calibre14">I took a deep breath. I picked up the mythology book. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d never asked a teacher for help before. Maybe if I talked to Mr. Brunner, he
                        could give me
                        some pointers. At least I could apologize for the big fat F I was about to score on his exam. I
                        didn’t want to
                        leave Yancy Academy with him thinking I hadn’t tried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I walked downstairs to the faculty offices. Most of them were dark and empty,
                        but Mr. Brunner’s
                        door was ajar, light from his window stretching across the hallway floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was three steps from the door handle when I heard voices inside the office.
                        Mr. Brunner asked
                        a question. A voice that was definitely Grover’s said “…worried about Percy, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I froze. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’m not usually an eavesdropper, but I dare you to try not listening if you

                    <p class="calibre14">I inched closer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“…alone this summer,” Grover was saying. “I mean, a Kindly One in the <em

                    <p class="calibre14">“We would only make matters worse by rushing him,” Mr. Brunner said. “We need

                        will be enough
                        to convince him of that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sir, I…I can’t fail in my duties again.” Grover’s voice was choked with
                        emotion. “You know
                        what that would mean.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You haven’t failed, Grover,” Mr. Brunner said kindly. “I should have seen her
                        for what she
                        was. Now let’s just worry about keeping Percy alive until next fall—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The mythology book dropped out of my hand and hit the floor with a thud. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. Brunner went silent. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My heart hammering, I picked up the book and backed down the hall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A shadow slid across the lighted glass of Brunner’s office door, the shadow of
                        something much
                        taller than my wheelchair-bound teacher, holding something that looked suspiciously like an
                        archer’s bow. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I opened the nearest door and slipped inside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A few seconds later I heard a slow <em class="calibre5">clop-clop-clop</em>,
                        like muffled wood
                        blocks, then a sound like an animal snuffling right outside my door. A large, dark shape paused
                        in front of the
                        glass, then moved on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bead of sweat trickled down my neck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Somewhere in the hallway, Mr. Brunner spoke. “Nothing,” he murmured. “My nerves
                        haven’t been
                        right since the winter solstice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mine neither,” Grover said. “But I could have sworn…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Go back to the dorm,” Mr. Brunner told him. “You’ve got a long day of exams
                        tomorrow.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t remind me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The lights went out in Mr. Brunner’s office. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I waited in the dark for what seemed like forever. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, I slipped out into the hallway and made my way back up to the dorm.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was lying on his bed, studying his Latin exam notes like he’d been there
                        all night. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey,” he said, bleary-eyed. “You going to be ready for this test?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You look awful.” He frowned. “Is everything okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just…tired.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned so he couldn’t read my expression, and started getting ready for bed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t understand what I’d heard downstairs. I wanted to believe I’d imagined
                        the whole
                        thing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But one thing was clear: Grover and Mr. Brunner were talking about me behind my
                        back. They
                        thought I was in some kind of danger. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The next afternoon, as I was leaving the three-hour Latin exam, my eyes
                        swimming with all the
                        Greek and Roman names I’d misspelled, Mr. Brunner called me back inside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a moment, I was worried he’d found out about my eavesdropping the night
                        before, but that
                        didn’t seem to be the problem. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” he said. “Don’t be discouraged about leaving Yancy. It’s…it’s for the
                        best.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His tone was kind, but the words still embarrassed me. Even though he was
                        speaking quietly, the
                        other kids finishing the test could hear. Nancy Bobofit smirked at me and made sarcastic little
                        kissing motions
                        with her lips. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I mumbled, “Okay, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I mean…” Mr. Brunner wheeled his chair back and forth, like he wasn’t sure
                        what to say. “This
                        isn’t the right place for you. It was only a matter of time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My eyes stung. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Here was my favorite teacher, in front of the class, telling me I couldn’t
                        handle it. After
                        saying he believed in me all year, now he was telling me I was destined to get kicked out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Right,” I said, trembling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, no,” Mr. Brunner said. “Oh, confound it all. What I’m trying to say…you’re
                        not normal,
                        Percy. That’s nothing to be—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thanks,” I blurted. “Thanks a lot, sir, for reminding me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But I was already gone. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">On the last day of the term, I shoved my clothes into my suitcase. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The other guys were joking around, talking about their vacation plans. One of
                        them was going on
                        a hiking trip to Switzerland. Another was cruising the Caribbean for a month. They were juvenile
                        delinquents,
                        like me, but they were <em class="calibre5">rich </em>juvenile delinquents. Their daddies were
                        executives, or
                        ambassadors, or celebrities. I was a nobody, from a family of nobodies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They asked me what I’d be doing this summer and I told them I was going back to
                        the city. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">What I didn’t tell them was that I’d have to get a summer job walking dogs or
                        selling magazine
                        subscriptions, and spend my free time worrying about where I’d go to school in the fall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh,” one of the guys said. “That’s cool.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They went back to their conversation as if I’d never existed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The only person I dreaded saying good-bye to was Grover, but as it turned out,
                        I didn’t have
                        to. He’d booked a ticket to Manhattan on the same Greyhound as I had, so there we were, together
                        again, heading
                        into the city. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">During the whole bus ride, Grover kept glancing nervously down the aisle,
                        watching the other
                        passengers. It occurred to me that he’d always acted nervous and fidgety when we left Yancy, as
                        if he expected
                        something bad to happen. Before, I’d always assumed he was worried about getting teased. But
                        there was nobody to
                        tease him on the Greyhound. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally I couldn’t stand it anymore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “Looking for Kindly Ones?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover nearly jumped out of his seat. “Wha—what do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I confessed about eavesdropping on him and Mr. Brunner the night before the
                        exam. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover’s eye twitched. “How much did you hear?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh…not much. What’s the summer solstice deadline?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He winced. “Look, Percy…I was just worried for you, see? I mean, hallucinating
                        about demon math
                        teachers…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And I was telling Mr. Brunner that maybe you were overstressed or something,
                        because there was
                        no such person as Mrs. Dodds, and…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover, you’re a really, really bad liar.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His ears turned pink. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">From his shirt pocket, he fished out a grubby business card. “Just take this,
                        okay? In case you
                        need me this summer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The card was in fancy script, which was murder on my dyslexic eyes, but I
                        finally made out
                        something like: </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"> </p>
                    <p class="center6"><em class="calibre5"><b class="calibre16">Grover Underwood</b><br
                                class="calibre1" />Keeper</em>
                    </p>
                    <p class="center"><em class="calibre5">Half-Blood Hill<br class="calibre1" />Long Island, New
                            York<br class="calibre1" />(800) 009-0009</em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14"> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s Half—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t say it aloud!” he yelped. “That’s my, um…summer address.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My heart sank. Grover had a summer home. I’d never considered that his family
                        might be as rich
                        as the others at Yancy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay,” I said glumly. “So, like, if I want to come visit your mansion.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He nodded. “Or…or if you need me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why would I need you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It came out harsher than I meant it to. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover blushed right down to his Adam’s apple. “Look, Percy, the truth is, I—I
                        kind of have to
                        protect you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All year long, I’d gotten in fights, keeping bullies away from him. I’d lost
                        sleep worrying
                        that he’d get beaten up next year without me. And here he was acting like he was the one who
                        defended <em class="calibre5">me</em>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover,” I said, “what exactly are you protecting me from?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a huge grinding noise under our feet. Black smoke poured from the
                        dashboard and the
                        whole bus filled with a smell like rotten eggs. The driver cursed and limped the Greyhound over
                        to the side of
                        the highway. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After a few minutes clanking around in the engine compartment, the driver
                        announced that we’d
                        all have to get off. Grover and I filed outside with everybody else. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We were on a stretch of country road—no place you’d notice if you didn’t break
                        down there. On
                        our side of the highway was nothing but maple trees and litter from passing cars. On the other
                        side, across four
                        lanes of asphalt shimmering with afternoon heat, was an old-fashioned fruit stand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The stuff on sale looked really good: heaping boxes of bloodred cherries and
                        apples, walnuts
                        and apricots, jugs of cider in a claw-foot tub full of ice. There were no customers, just three
                        old ladies
                        sitting in rocking chairs in the shade of a maple tree, knitting the biggest pair of socks I’d
                        ever seen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I mean these socks were the size of sweaters, but they were clearly socks. The
                        lady on the
                        right knitted one of them. The lady on the left knitted the other. The lady in the middle held
                        an enormous
                        basket of electric-blue yarn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All three women looked ancient, with pale faces wrinkled like fruit leather,
                        silver hair tied
                        back in white bandannas, bony arms sticking out of bleached cotton dresses. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The weirdest thing was, they seemed to be looking right at me. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/2-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked over at Grover to say something about this and saw that the blood had
                        drained from his
                        face. His nose was twitching. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover?” I said. “Hey, man—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tell me they’re not looking at you. They are, aren’t they?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah. Weird, huh? You think those socks would fit me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not funny, Percy. Not funny at all.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old lady in the middle took out a huge pair of scissors—gold and silver,
                        long-bladed, like
                        shears. I heard Grover catch his breath. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re getting on the bus,” he told me. “Come on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” I said. “It’s a thousand degrees in there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on!” He pried open the door and climbed inside, but I stayed back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Across the road, the old ladies were still watching me. The middle one cut the
                        yarn, and I
                        swear I could hear that <em class="calibre5">snip </em>across four lanes of traffic. Her two
                        friends balled up
                        the electric-blue socks, leaving me wondering who they could possibly be for—Sasquatch or
                        Godzilla. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the rear of the bus, the driver wrenched a big chunk of smoking metal out of
                        the engine
                        compartment. The bus shuddered, and the engine roared back to life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The passengers cheered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Darn right!” yelled the driver. He slapped the bus with his hat. “Everybody
                        back on board!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Once we got going, I started feeling feverish, as if I’d caught the flu. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover didn’t look much better. He was shivering and his teeth were chattering.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What are you not telling me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He dabbed his forehead with his shirt sleeve. “Percy, what did you see back at
                        the fruit
                        stand?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean the old ladies? What is it about them, man? They’re not like…Mrs.
                        Dodds, are they?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His expression was hard to read, but I got the feeling that the fruit-stand
                        ladies were
                        something much, much worse than Mrs. Dodds. He said, “Just tell me what you saw.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The middle one took out her scissors, and she cut the yarn.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He closed his eyes and made a gesture with his fingers that might’ve been
                        crossing himself, but
                        it wasn’t. It was something else, something almost—older. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He said, “You saw her snip the cord.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah. So?” But even as I said it, I knew it was a big deal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is not happening,” Grover mumbled. He started chewing at his thumb. “I
                        don’t want this to
                        be like the last time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What last time?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Always sixth grade. They never get past sixth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover,” I said, because he was really starting to scare me. “What are you
                        talking about?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Let me walk you home from the bus station. Promise me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">This seemed like a strange request to me, but I promised he could. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Is this like a superstition or something?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover—that snipping of the yarn. Does that mean somebody is going to die?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked at me mournfully, like he was already picking the kind of flowers I’d
                        like best on my
                        coffin. </p>

                        to the bus
                        terminal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I know, I know. It was rude. But Grover was freaking me out, looking at me like
                        I was a dead
                        man, muttering “Why does this always happen?” and “Why does it always have to be sixth grade?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Whenever he got upset, Grover’s bladder acted up, so I wasn’t surprised when,
                        as soon as we got
                        off the bus, he made me promise to wait for him, then made a beeline for the restroom. Instead
                        of waiting, I got
                        my suitcase, slipped outside, and caught the first taxi uptown. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“East One-hundred-and-fourth and First,” I told the driver. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">A word about my mother, before you meet her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her name is Sally Jackson and she’s the best person in the world, which just
                        proves my theory
                        that the best people have the rottenest luck. Her own parents died in a plane crash when she was
                        five, and she
                        was raised by an uncle who didn’t care much about her. She wanted to be a novelist, so she spent
                        high school
                        working to save enough money for a college with a good creative-writing program. Then her uncle
                        got cancer, and
                        she had to quit school her senior year to take care of him. After he died, she was left with no
                        money, no
                        family, and no diploma. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The only good break she ever got was meeting my dad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I don’t have any memories of him, just this sort of warm glow, maybe the barest
                        trace of his
                        smile. My mom doesn’t like to talk about him because it makes her sad. She has no pictures. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">See, they weren’t married. She told me he was rich and important, and their
                        relationship was a
                        secret. Then one day, he set sail across the Atlantic on some important journey, and he never
                        came back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Lost at sea, my mom told me. Not dead. Lost at sea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She worked odd jobs, took night classes to get her high school diploma, and
                        raised me on her
                        own. She never complained or got mad. Not even once. But I knew I wasn’t an easy kid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, she married Gabe Ugliano, who was nice the first thirty seconds we
                        knew him, then
                        showed his true colors as a world-class jerk. When I was young, I nicknamed him Smelly Gabe. I’m
                        sorry, but it’s
                        the truth. The guy reeked like moldy garlic pizza wrapped in gym shorts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Between the two of us, we made my mom’s life pretty hard. The way Smelly Gabe
                        treated her, the
                        way he and I got along…well, when I came home is a good example. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I walked into our little apartment, hoping my mom would be home from work.
                        Instead, Smelly Gabe
                        was in the living room, playing poker with his buddies. The television blared ESPN. Chips and
                        beer cans were
                        strewn all over the carpet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hardly looking up, he said around his cigar, “So, you’re home.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/3-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where’s my mom?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Working,” he said. “You got any cash?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That was it. No <em class="calibre5">Welcome back. Good to see you. How has
                            your life been the
                            last six months? </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe had put on weight. He looked like a tuskless walrus in thrift-store
                        clothes. He had about
                        three hairs on his head, all combed over his bald scalp, as if that made him handsome or
                        something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He managed the Electronics Mega-Mart in Queens, but he stayed home most of the
                        time. I don’t
                        know why he hadn’t been fired long before. He just kept on collecting paychecks, spending the
                        money on cigars
                        that made me nauseous, and on beer, of course. Always beer. Whenever I was home, he expected me
                        to provide his
                        gambling funds. He called that our “guy secret.” Meaning, if I told my mom, he would punch my
                        lights out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t have any cash,” I told him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He raised a greasy eyebrow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe could sniff out money like a bloodhound, which was surprising, since his
                        own smell
                        should’ve covered up everything else. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You took a taxi from the bus station,” he said. “Probably paid with a twenty.
                        Got six, seven
                        bucks in change. Somebody expects to live under this roof, he ought to carry his own weight. Am
                        I right, Eddie?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eddie, the super of the apartment building, looked at me with a twinge of
                        sympathy. “Come on,
                        Gabe,” he said. “The kid just got here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Am I <em class="calibre5">right</em>?” Gabe repeated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eddie scowled into his bowl of pretzels. The other two guys passed gas in
                        harmony. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fine,” I said. I dug a wad of dollars out of my pocket and threw the money on
                        the table. “I
                        hope you lose.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your report card came, brain boy!” he shouted after me. “I wouldn’t act so
                        snooty!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I slammed the door to my room, which really wasn’t my room. During school
                        months, it was Gabe’s
                        “study.” He didn’t study anything in there except old car magazines, but he loved shoving my
                        stuff in the
                        closet, leaving his muddy boots on my windowsill, and doing his best to make the place smell
                        like his nasty
                        cologne and cigars and stale beer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I dropped my suitcase on the bed. Home sweet home. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe’s smell was almost worse than the nightmares about Mrs. Dodds, or the
                        sound of that old
                        fruit lady’s shears snipping the yarn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But as soon as I thought that, my legs felt weak. I remembered Grover’s look of
                        panic—how he’d
                        made me promise I wouldn’t go home without him. A sudden chill rolled through me. I felt like
                        someone—something—was looking for me right now, maybe pounding its way up the stairs, growing
                        long, horrible
                        talons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I heard my mom’s voice. “Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She opened the bedroom door, and my fears melted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother can make me feel good just by walking into the room. Her eyes sparkle
                        and change
                        color in the light. Her smile is as warm as a quilt. She’s got a few gray streaks mixed in with
                        her long brown
                        hair, but I never think of her as old. When she looks at me, it’s like she’s seeing all the good
                        things about
                        me, none of the bad. I’ve never heard her raise her voice or say an unkind word to anyone, not
                        even me or Gabe.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Percy.” She hugged me tight. “I can’t believe it. You’ve grown since
                        Christmas!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her red-white-and-blue Sweet on America uniform smelled like the best things in
                        the world:
                        chocolate, licorice, and all the other stuff she sold at the candy shop in Grand Central. She’d
                        brought me a
                        huge bag of “free samples,” the way she always did when I came home. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/3-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We sat together on the edge of the bed. While I attacked the blueberry sour
                        strings, she ran
                        her hand through my hair and demanded to know everything I hadn’t put in my letters. She didn’t
                        mention anything
                        about my getting expelled. She didn’t seem to care about that. But was I okay? Was her little
                        boy doing all
                        right? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told her she was smothering me, and to lay off and all that, but secretly, I
                        was really,
                        really glad to see her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">From the other room, Gabe yelled, “Hey, Sally—how about some bean dip, huh?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I gritted my teeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mom is the nicest lady in the world. She should’ve been married to a
                        millionaire, not to
                        some jerk like Gabe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For her sake, I tried to sound upbeat about my last days at Yancy Academy. I
                        told her I wasn’t
                        too down about the expulsion. I’d lasted almost the whole year this time. I’d made some new
                        friends. I’d done
                        pretty well in Latin. And honestly, the fights hadn’t been as bad as the headmaster said. I
                        liked Yancy Academy.
                        I really did. I put such a good spin on the year, I almost convinced myself. I started choking
                        up, thinking
                        about Grover and Mr. Brunner. Even Nancy Bobofit suddenly didn’t seem so bad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Until that trip to the museum…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” my mom asked. Her eyes tugged at my conscience, trying to pull out the
                        secrets. “Did
                        something scare you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, Mom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt bad lying. I wanted to tell her about Mrs. Dodds and the three old
                        ladies with the yarn,
                        but I thought it would sound stupid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pursed her lips. She knew I was holding back, but she didn’t push me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have a surprise for you,” she said. “We’re going to the beach.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My eyes widened. “Montauk?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Three nights—same cabin.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“When?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She smiled. “As soon as I get changed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t believe it. My mom and I hadn’t been to Montauk the last two
                        summers, because Gabe
                        said there wasn’t enough money. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe appeared in the doorway and growled, “Bean dip, Sally? Didn’t you hear
                        me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to punch him, but I met my mom’s eyes and I understood she was
                        offering me a deal: be
                        nice to Gabe for a little while. Just until she was ready to leave for Montauk. Then we would
                        get out of here.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I was on my way, honey,” she told Gabe. “We were just talking about the trip.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe’s eyes got small. “The trip? You mean you were serious about that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I knew it,” I muttered. “He won’t let us go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Of course he will,” my mom said evenly. “Your stepfather is just worried about
                        money. That’s
                        all. Besides,” she added, “Gabriel won’t have to settle for bean dip. I’ll make him enough
                        seven-layer dip for
                        the whole weekend. Guacamole. Sour cream. The works.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe softened a bit. “So this money for your trip…it comes out of your clothes
                        budget, right?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, honey,” my mother said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And you won’t take my car anywhere but there and back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll be very careful.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe scratched his double chin. “Maybe if you hurry with that seven-layer
                        dip…And maybe if the
                        kid apologizes for interrupting my poker game.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Maybe if I kick you in your soft spot, I thought. And make you sing soprano for
                        a week. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But my mom’s eyes warned me not to make him mad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Why did she put up with this guy? I wanted to scream. Why did she care what he
                        thought? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry,” I muttered. “I’m really sorry I interrupted your incredibly
                        important poker game.
                        Please go back to it right now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe’s eyes narrowed. His tiny brain was probably trying to detect sarcasm in
                        my statement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, whatever,” he decided. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He went back to his game. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thank you, Percy,” my mom said. “Once we get to Montauk, we’ll talk more
                        about…whatever you’ve
                        forgotten to tell me, okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a moment, I thought I saw anxiety in her eyes—the same fear I’d seen in
                        Grover during the
                        bus ride—as if my mom too felt an odd chill in the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">But then her smile returned, and I figured I must have been mistaken. She
                        ruffled my hair and
                        went to make Gabe his seven-layer dip. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">An hour later we were ready to leave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe took a break from his poker game long enough to watch me lug my mom’s bags
                        to the car. He
                        kept griping and groaning about losing her cooking—and more important, his ’78 Camaro—for the
                        whole weekend.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not a scratch on this car, brain boy,” he warned me as I loaded the last bag.
                        “Not one little
                        scratch.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Like I’d be the one driving. I was twelve. But that didn’t matter to Gabe. If a
                        seagull so much
                        as pooped on his paint job, he’d find a way to blame me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Watching him lumber back toward the apartment building, I got so mad I did
                        something I can’t
                        explain. As Gabe reached the doorway, I made the hand gesture I’d seen Grover make on the bus, a
                        sort of
                        warding-off-evil gesture, a clawed hand over my heart, then a shoving movement toward Gabe. The
                        screen door
                        slammed shut so hard it whacked him in the butt and sent him flying up the staircase as if he’d
                        been shot from a
                        cannon. Maybe it was just the wind, or some freak accident with the hinges, but I didn’t stay
                        long enough to
                        find out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I got in the Camaro and told my mom to step on it. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Our rental cabin was on the south shore, way out at the tip of Long Island. It
                        was a little
                        pastel box with faded curtains, half sunken into the dunes. There was always sand in the sheets
                        and spiders in
                        the cabinets, and most of the time the sea was too cold to swim in. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I loved the place. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We’d been going there since I was a baby. My mom had been going even longer.
                        She never exactly
                        said, but I knew why the beach was special to her. It was the place where she’d met my dad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As we got closer to Montauk, she seemed to grow younger, years of worry and
                        work disappearing
                        from her face. Her eyes turned the color of the sea. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/3-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We got there at sunset, opened all the cabin’s windows, and went through our
                        usual cleaning
                        routine. We walked on the beach, fed blue corn chips to the seagulls, and munched on blue jelly
                        beans, blue
                        saltwater taffy, and all the other free samples my mom had brought from work. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I guess I should explain the blue food. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">See, Gabe had once told my mom there was no such thing. They had this fight,
                        which seemed like
                        a really small thing at the time. But ever since, my mom went out of her way to eat blue. She
                        baked blue
                        birthday cakes. She mixed blueberry smoothies. She bought blue-corn tortilla chips and brought
                        home blue candy
                        from the shop. This—along with keeping her maiden name, Jackson, rather than calling herself
                        Mrs. Ugliano—was
                        proof that she wasn’t totally suckered by Gabe. She did have a rebellious streak, like me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When it got dark, we made a fire. We roasted hot dogs and marshmallows. Mom
                        told me stories
                        about when she was a kid, back before her parents died in the plane crash. She told me about the
                        books she
                        wanted to write someday, when she had enough money to quit the candy shop. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Eventually, I got up the nerve to ask about what was always on my mind whenever
                        we came to
                        Montauk—my father. Mom’s eyes went all misty. I figured she would tell me the same things she
                        always did, but I
                        never got tired of hearing them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He was kind, Percy,” she said. “Tall, handsome, and powerful. But gentle, too.
                        You have his
                        black hair, you know, and his green eyes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mom fished a blue jelly bean out of her candy bag. “I wish he could see you,
                        Percy. He would be
                        so proud.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wondered how she could say that. What was so great about me? A dyslexic,
                        hyperactive boy with
                        a D+ report card, kicked out of school for the sixth time in six years. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How old was I?” I asked. “I mean…when he left?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She watched the flames. “He was only with me for one summer, Percy. Right here
                        at this beach.
                        This cabin.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But…he knew me as a baby.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, honey. He knew I was expecting a baby, but he never saw you. He had to
                        leave before you
                        were born.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to square that with the fact that I seemed to remember…something about
                        my father. A
                        warm glow. A smile. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I had always assumed he knew me as a baby. My mom had never said it outright,
                        but still, I’d
                        felt it must be true. Now, to be told that he’d never even seen me…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt angry at my father. Maybe it was stupid, but I resented him for going on
                        that ocean
                        voyage, for not having the guts to marry my mom. He’d left us, and now we were stuck with Smelly
                        Gabe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are you going to send me away again?” I asked her. “To another boarding
                        school?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pulled a marshmallow from the fire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know, honey.” Her voice was heavy. “I think…I think we’ll have to do
                        something.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because you don’t want me around?” I regretted the words as soon as they were
                        out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mom’s eyes welled with tears. She took my hand, squeezed it tight. “Oh,
                        Percy, no. I—I <em class="calibre5">have </em>to, honey. For your own good. I have to send you
                        away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her words reminded me of what Mr. Brunner had said—that it was best for me to
                        leave Yancy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because I’m not normal,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You say that as if it’s a bad thing, Percy. But you don’t realize how
                        important you are. I
                        thought Yancy Academy would be far enough away. I thought you’d finally be safe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Safe from what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She met my eyes, and a flood of memories came back to me—all the weird, scary
                        things that had
                        ever happened to me, some of which I’d tried to forget. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">During third grade, a man in a black trench coat had stalked me on the
                        playground. When the
                        teachers threatened to call the police, he went away growling, but no one believed me when I
                        told them that
                        under his broad-brimmed hat, the man only had one eye, right in the middle of his head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before that—a really early memory. I was in preschool, and a teacher
                        accidentally put me down
                        for a nap in a cot that a snake had slithered into. My mom screamed when she came to pick me up
                        and found me
                        playing with a limp, scaly rope I’d somehow managed to strangle to death with my meaty toddler
                        hands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In every single school, something creepy had happened, something unsafe, and I
                        was forced to
                        move. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew I should tell my mom about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and Mrs.
                        Dodds at the art
                        museum, about my weird hallucination that I had sliced my math teacher into dust with a sword.
                        But I couldn’t
                        make myself tell her. I had a strange feeling the news would end our trip to Montauk, and I
                        didn’t want that.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve tried to keep you as close to me as I could,” my mom said. “They told me
                        that was a
                        mistake. But there’s only one other option, Percy—the place your father wanted to send you. And
                        I just…I just
                        can’t stand to do it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My father wanted me to go to a special school?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not a school,” she said softly. “A summer camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My head was spinning. Why would my dad—who hadn’t even stayed around long
                        enough to see me
                        born—talk to my mom about a summer camp? And if it was so important, why hadn’t she ever
                        mentioned it before?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry, Percy,” she said, seeing the look in my eyes. “But I can’t talk
                        about it. I—I
                        couldn’t send you to that place. It might mean saying good-bye to you for good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“For good? But if it’s only a summer camp…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She turned toward the fire, and I knew from her expression that if I asked her
                        any more
                        questions she would start to cry. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">That night I had a vivid dream. It was storming on the beach, and two beautiful
                        animals, a
                        white horse and a golden eagle, were trying to kill each other at the edge of the surf. The
                        eagle swooped down
                        and slashed the horse’s muzzle with its huge talons. The horse reared up and kicked at the
                        eagle’s wings. As
                        they fought, the ground rumbled, and a monstrous voice chuckled somewhere beneath the earth,
                        goading the animals
                        to fight harder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I ran toward them, knowing I had to stop them from killing each other, but I
                        was running in
                        slow motion. I knew I would be too late. I saw the eagle dive down, its beak aimed at the
                        horse’s wide eyes, and
                        I screamed, <em class="calibre5">No! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I woke with a start. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Outside, it really was storming, the kind of storm that cracks trees and blows
                        down houses.
                        There was no horse or eagle on the beach, just lightning making false daylight, and twenty-foot
                        waves pounding
                        the dunes like artillery. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">With the next thunderclap, my mom woke. She sat up, eyes wide, and said,
                        “Hurricane.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew that was crazy. Long Island never sees hurricanes this early in the
                        summer. But the
                        ocean seemed to have forgotten. Over the roar of the wind, I heard a distant bellow, an angry,
                        tortured sound
                        that made my hair stand on end. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then a much closer noise, like mallets in the sand. A desperate voice—someone
                        yelling, pounding
                        on our cabin door. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother sprang out of bed in her nightgown and threw open the lock. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover stood framed in the doorway against a backdrop of pouring rain. But he
                        wasn’t…he wasn’t
                        exactly Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Searching all night,” he gasped. “What were you thinking?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother looked at me in terror—not scared of Grover, but of why he’d come.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” she said, shouting to be heard over the rain. “What happened at
                        school? What didn’t
                        you tell me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was frozen, looking at Grover. I couldn’t understand what I was seeing. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/3-4.png"

                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“O Zeu kai alloi theoi!” </em>he yelled. “It’s right
                        behind me! Didn’t you
                        <em class="calibre5">tell </em>her?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was too shocked to register that he’d just cursed in Ancient Greek, and I’d
                        understood him
                        perfectly. I was too shocked to wonder how Grover had gotten here by himself in the middle of
                        the night. Because
                        Grover didn’t have his pants on—and where his legs should be…where his legs should be…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mom looked at me sternly and talked in a tone she’d never used before: “<em
                            class="calibre5">Percy. </em>Tell me <em class="calibre5">now</em>!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stammered something about the old ladies at the fruit stand, and Mrs. Dodds,
                        and my mom
                        stared at me, her face deathly pale in the flashes of lightning. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She grabbed her purse, tossed me my rain jacket, and said, “Get to the car.
                        Both of you. <em class="calibre5">Go</em>!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover ran for the Camaro—but he wasn’t running, exactly. He was trotting,
                        shaking his shaggy
                        hindquarters, and suddenly his story about a muscular disorder in his legs made sense to me. I
                        understood how he
                        could run so fast and still limp when he walked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Because where his feet should be, there were no feet. There were cloven hooves.

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">W</span>e tore through the night along dark country roads.
                        Wind slammed
                        against the Camaro. Rain lashed the windshield. I didn’t know how my mom could see anything, but
                        she kept her
                        foot on the gas. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Every time there was a flash of lightning, I looked at Grover sitting next to
                        me in the
                        backseat and I wondered if I’d gone insane, or if he was wearing some kind of shag-carpet pants.
                        But, no, the
                        smell was one I remembered from kindergarten field trips to the petting zoo—lanolin, like from
                        wool. The smell
                        of a wet barnyard animal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All I could think to say was, “So, you and my mom…know each other?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover’s eyes flitted to the rearview mirror, though there were no cars behind
                        us. “Not
                        exactly,” he said. “I mean, we’ve never met in person. But she knew I was watching you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Watching me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Keeping tabs on you. Making sure you were okay. But I wasn’t faking being your
                        friend,” he
                        added hastily. “I <em class="calibre5">am </em>your friend.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um…what <em class="calibre5">are </em>you, exactly?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That doesn’t matter right now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It doesn’t matter? From the waist down, my best friend is a donkey—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover let out a sharp, throaty <em class="calibre5">“Blaa-ha-ha!” </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d heard him make that sound before, but I’d always assumed it was a nervous
                        laugh. Now I
                        realized it was more of an irritated bleat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Goat!” he cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m a <em class="calibre5">goat </em>from the waist down.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You just said it didn’t matter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“Blaa-ha-ha! </em>There are satyrs who would trample you
                        underhoof for
                        such an insult!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa. Wait. Satyrs. You mean like…Mr. Brunner’s myths?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Were those old ladies at the fruit stand a <em class="calibre5">myth</em>,
                        Percy? Was Mrs.
                        Dodds a myth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So you <em class="calibre5">admit </em>there was a Mrs. Dodds!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Of course.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then why—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The less you knew, the fewer monsters you’d attract,” Grover said, like that
                        should be
                        perfectly obvious. “We put Mist over the humans’ eyes. We hoped you’d think the Kindly One was a
                        hallucination.
                        But it was no good. You started to realize who you are.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who I—wait a minute, what do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The weird bellowing noise rose up again somewhere behind us, closer than
                        before. Whatever was
                        chasing us was still on our trail. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” my mom said, “there’s too much to explain and not enough time. We have
                        to get you to
                        safety.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Safety from what? Who’s after me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, nobody much,” Grover said, obviously still miffed about the donkey
                        comment. “Just the Lord
                        of the Dead and a few of his blood-thirstiest minions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sorry, Mrs. Jackson. Could you drive faster, please?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to wrap my mind around what was happening, but I couldn’t do it. I knew
                        this wasn’t a
                        dream. I had no imagination. I could never dream up something this weird. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mom made a hard left. We swerved onto a narrower road, racing past darkened
                        farmhouses and
                        wooded hills and <small class="calibre4">PICK YOUR OWN STRAWBERRIES</small> signs on white
                        picket fences. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where are we going?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The summer camp I told you about.” My mother’s voice was tight; she was trying
                        for my sake not
                        to be scared. “The place your father wanted to send you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The place you didn’t want me to go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Please, dear,” my mother begged. “This is hard enough. Try to understand.
                        You’re in danger.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because some old ladies cut yarn.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Those weren’t old ladies,” Grover said. “Those were the Fates. Do you know
                        what it means—the
                        fact they appeared in front of you? They only do that when you’re about to…when someone’s about
                        to die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa. You said ‘you.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No I didn’t. I said ‘someone.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You meant ‘you.’ As in <em class="calibre5">me</em>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I meant <em class="calibre5">you</em>, like ‘someone.’ Not you, <em
                            class="calibre5">you</em>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Boys!” my mom said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pulled the wheel hard to the right, and I got a glimpse of a figure she’d
                        swerved to
                        avoid—a dark fluttering shape now lost behind us in the storm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What was that?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re almost there,” my mother said, ignoring my question. “Another mile.
                        Please. Please.
                        Please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know where <em class="calibre5">there </em>was, but I found myself
                        leaning forward in
                        the car, anticipating, wanting us to arrive. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Outside, nothing but rain and darkness—the kind of empty countryside you get
                        way out on the tip
                        of Long Island. I thought about Mrs. Dodds and the moment when she’d changed into the thing with
                        pointed teeth
                        and leathery wings. My limbs went numb from delayed shock. She really <em
                            class="calibre5">hadn’t
                        </em>been
                        human. She’d meant to kill me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I thought about Mr. Brunner…and the sword he had thrown me. Before I could
                        ask Grover
                        about that, the hair rose on the back of my neck. There was a blinding flash, a jaw-rattling <em
                            class="calibre5">boom!</em>, and our car exploded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I remember feeling weightless, like I was being crushed, fried, and hosed down
                        all at the same
                        time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I peeled my forehead off the back of the driver’s seat and said, “Ow.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” my mom shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m okay.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to shake off the daze. I wasn’t dead. The car hadn’t really exploded.
                        We’d swerved into
                        a ditch. Our driver’s-side doors were wedged in the mud. The roof had cracked open like an
                        eggshell and rain was
                        pouring in. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Lightning. That was the only explanation. We’d been blasted right off the road.
                        Next to me in
                        the backseat was a big motionless lump. “Grover!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was slumped over, blood trickling from the side of his mouth. I shook his
                        furry hip,
                        thinking, No! Even if you are half barnyard animal, you’re my best friend and I don’t want you
                        to die! </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then he groaned “Food,” and I knew there was hope. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” my mother said, “we have to…” Her voice faltered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked back. In a flash of lightning, through the mud-spattered rear
                        windshield, I saw a
                        figure lumbering toward us on the shoulder of the road. The sight of it made my skin crawl. It
                        was a dark
                        silhouette of a huge guy, like a football player. He seemed to be holding a blanket over his
                        head. His top half
                        was bulky and fuzzy. His upraised hands made it look like he had horns. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I swallowed hard. “Who is—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” my mother said, deadly serious. “Get out of the car.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother threw herself against the driver’s-side door. It was jammed shut in
                        the mud. I tried
                        mine. Stuck too. I looked up desperately at the hole in the roof. It might’ve been an exit, but
                        the edges were
                        sizzling and smoking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Climb out the passenger’s side!” my mother told me. “Percy—you have to run. Do
                        you see that
                        big tree?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Another flash of lightning, and through the smoking hole in the roof I saw the
                        tree she meant:
                        a huge, White House Christmas tree–sized pine at the crest of the nearest hill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s the property line,” my mom said. “Get over that hill and you’ll see a
                        big farmhouse
                        down in the valley. Run and don’t look back. Yell for help. Don’t stop until you reach the
                        door.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom, you’re coming too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her face was pale, her eyes as sad as when she looked at the ocean. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” I shouted. “You <em class="calibre5">are </em>coming with me. Help me
                        carry Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Food!” Grover moaned, a little louder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The man with the blanket on his head kept coming toward us, making his
                        grunting, snorting
                        noises. As he got closer, I realized he <em class="calibre5">couldn’t </em>be holding a blanket
                        over his head,
                        because his hands—huge meaty hands—were swinging at his sides. There was no blanket. Meaning the
                        bulky, fuzzy
                        mass that was too big to be his head…was his head. And the points that looked like horns…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He doesn’t want <em class="calibre5">us</em>,” my mother told me. “He wants
                        you. Besides, I
                        can’t cross the property line.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We don’t have time, Percy. Go. Please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got mad, then—mad at my mother, at Grover the goat, at the thing with horns
                        that was
                        lumbering toward us slowly and deliberately like, like a bull. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I climbed across Grover and pushed the door open into the rain. “We’re going
                        together. Come on,
                        Mom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I told you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom! I am not leaving you. Help me with Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t wait for her answer. I scrambled outside, dragging Grover from the
                        car. He was
                        surprisingly light, but I couldn’t have carried him very far if my mom hadn’t come to my aid.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Together, we draped Grover’s arms over our shoulders and started stumbling
                        uphill through wet
                        waist-high grass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Glancing back, I got my first clear look at the monster. He was seven feet
                        tall, easy, his arms
                        and legs like something from the cover of <em class="calibre5">Muscle Man </em>magazine—bulging
                        biceps and
                        triceps and a bunch of other ’ceps, all stuffed like baseballs under vein-webbed skin. He wore
                        no clothes except
                        underwear—I mean, bright white Fruit of the Looms—which would’ve looked funny, except that the
                        top half of his
                        body was so scary. Coarse brown hair started at about his belly button and got thicker as it
                        reached his
                        shoulders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His neck was a mass of muscle and fur leading up to his enormous head, which
                        had a snout as
                        long as my arm, snotty nostrils with a gleaming brass ring, cruel black eyes, and horns—enormous
                        black-and-white
                        horns with points you just couldn’t get from an electric sharpener. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I recognized the monster, all right. He had been in one of the first stories
                        Mr. Brunner told
                        us. But he couldn’t be real. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked the rain out of my eyes. “That’s—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Pasiphae’s son,” my mother said. “I wish I’d known how badly they want to kill
                        you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But he’s the Min—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t say his name,” she warned. “Names have power.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The pine tree was still way too far—a hundred yards uphill at least. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I glanced behind me again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man hunched over our car, looking in the windows—or not looking,
                        exactly. More like
                        snuffling, nuzzling. I wasn’t sure why he bothered, since we were only about fifty feet away.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Food?” Grover moaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shhh,” I told him. “Mom, what’s he doing? Doesn’t he see us?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“His sight and hearing are terrible,” she said. “He goes by smell. But he’ll
                        figure out where
                        we are soon enough.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As if on cue, the bull-man bellowed in rage. He picked up Gabe’s Camaro by the
                        torn roof, the
                        chassis creaking and groaning. He raised the car over his head and threw it down the road. It
                        slammed into the
                        wet asphalt and skidded in a shower of sparks for about half a mile before coming to a stop. The
                        gas tank
                        exploded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Not a scratch, </em>I remembered Gabe saying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Oops. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” my mom said. “When he sees us, he’ll charge. Wait until the last
                        second, then jump out
                        of the way—directly sideways. He can’t change directions very well once he’s charging. Do you
                        understand?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How do you know all this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve been worried about an attack for a long time. I should have expected
                        this. I was selfish,
                        keeping you near me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Keeping me near you? But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Another bellow of rage, and the bull-man started tromping uphill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He’d smelled us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The pine tree was only a few more yards, but the hill was getting steeper and
                        slicker, and
                        Grover wasn’t getting any lighter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man closed in. Another few seconds and he’d be on top of us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother must’ve been exhausted, but she shouldered Grover. “Go, Percy!
                        Separate! Remember
                        what I said.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t want to split up, but I had the feeling she was right—it was our only
                        chance. I
                        sprinted to the left, turned, and saw the creature bearing down on me. His black eyes glowed
                        with hate. He
                        reeked like rotten meat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He lowered his head and charged, those razor-sharp horns aimed straight at my
                        chest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The fear in my stomach made me want to bolt, but that wouldn’t work. I could
                        never outrun this
                        thing. So I held my ground, and at the last moment, I jumped to the side. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man stormed past like a freight train, then bellowed with frustration
                        and turned, but
                        not toward me this time, toward my mother, who was setting Grover down in the grass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We’d reached the crest of the hill. Down the other side I could see a valley,
                        just as my mother
                        had said, and the lights of a farmhouse glowing yellow through the rain. But that was half a
                        mile away. We’d
                        never make it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man grunted, pawing the ground. He kept eyeing my mother, who was now
                        retreating
                        slowly downhill, back toward the road, trying to lead the monster away from Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Run, Percy!” she told me. “I can’t go any farther. Run!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But I just stood there, frozen in fear, as the monster charged her. She tried
                        to sidestep, as
                        she’d told me to do, but the monster had learned his lesson. His hand shot out and grabbed her
                        by the neck as
                        she tried to get away. He lifted her as she struggled, kicking and pummeling the air. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She caught my eyes, managed to choke out one last word: “Go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then, with an angry roar, the monster closed his fists around my mother’s neck,
                        and she
                        dissolved before my eyes, melting into light, a shimmering golden form, as if she were a
                        holographic projection.
                        A blinding flash, and she was simply…gone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Anger replaced my fear. Newfound strength burned in my limbs—the same rush of
                        energy I’d gotten
                        when Mrs. Dodds grew talons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man bore down on Grover, who lay helpless in the grass. The monster
                        hunched over,
                        snuffling my best friend, as if he were about to lift Grover up and make him dissolve too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t allow that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stripped off my red rain jacket. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” I screamed, waving the jacket, running to one side of the monster. “Hey,
                        stupid! Ground
                        beef!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/4-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Raaaarrrrr!” The monster turned toward me, shaking his meaty fists. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I had an idea—a stupid idea, but better than no idea at all. I put my back to
                        the big pine tree
                        and waved my red jacket in front of the bull-man, thinking I’d jump out of the way at the last
                        moment. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But it didn’t happen like that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man charged too fast, his arms out to grab me whichever way I tried to
                        dodge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Time slowed down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My legs tensed. I couldn’t jump sideways, so I leaped straight up, kicking off
                        from the
                        creature’s head, using it as a springboard, turning in midair, and landing on his neck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">How did I do that? I didn’t have time to figure it out. A millisecond later,
                        the monster’s head
                        slammed into the tree and the impact nearly knocked my teeth out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man staggered around, trying to shake me. I locked my arms around his
                        horns to keep
                        from being thrown. Thunder and lightning were still going strong. The rain was in my eyes. The
                        smell of rotten
                        meat burned my nostrils. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The monster shook himself around and bucked like a rodeo bull. He should have
                        just backed up
                        into the tree and smashed me flat, but I was starting to realize that this thing had only one
                        gear: forward.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Meanwhile, Grover started groaning in the grass. I wanted to yell at him to
                        shut up, but the
                        way I was getting tossed around, if I opened my mouth I’d bite my own tongue off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Food!” Grover moaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man wheeled toward him, pawed the ground again, and got ready to
                        charge. I thought
                        about how he had squeezed the life out of my mother, made her disappear in a flash of light, and
                        rage filled me
                        like high-octane fuel. I got both hands around one horn and I pulled backward with all my might.
                        The monster
                        tensed, gave a surprised grunt, then—<em class="calibre5">snap! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man screamed and flung me through the air. I landed flat on my back in
                        the grass. My
                        head smacked against a rock. When I sat up, my vision was blurry, but I had a horn in my hands,
                        a ragged bone
                        weapon the size of a knife. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The monster charged. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Without thinking, I rolled to one side and came up kneeling. As the monster
                        barreled past, I
                        drove the broken horn straight into his side, right up under his furry rib cage. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bull-man roared in agony. He flailed, clawing at his chest, then began to
                        disintegrate—not
                        like my mother, in a flash of golden light, but like crumbling sand, blown away in chunks by the
                        wind, the same
                        way Mrs. Dodds had burst apart. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The monster was gone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The rain had stopped. The storm still rumbled, but only in the distance. I
                        smelled like
                        livestock and my knees were shaking. My head felt like it was splitting open. I was weak and
                        scared and
                        trembling with grief. I’d just seen my mother vanish. I wanted to lie down and cry, but there
                        was Grover,
                        needing my help, so I managed to haul him up and stagger down into the valley, toward the lights
                        of the
                        farmhouse. I was crying, calling for my mother, but I held on to Grover—I wasn’t going to let
                        him go. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The last thing I remember is collapsing on a wooden porch, looking up at a
                        ceiling fan circling
                        above me, moths flying around a yellow light, and the stern faces of a familiar-looking bearded
                        man and a pretty
                        girl, her blond hair curled like a princess’s. They both looked down at me, and the girl said,
                        “He’s the one. He
                        must be.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Silence, Annabeth,” the man said. “He’s still conscious. Bring him inside.”

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">I</span> had weird dreams full of barnyard animals. Most
                        of them wanted to
                        kill me. The rest wanted food. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I must’ve woken up several times, but what I heard and saw made no sense, so I
                        just passed out
                        again. I remember lying in a soft bed, being spoon-fed something that tasted like buttered
                        popcorn, only it was
                        pudding. The girl with curly blond hair hovered over me, smirking as she scraped drips off my
                        chin with the
                        spoon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When she saw my eyes open, she asked, “What will happen at the summer
                        solstice?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed to croak, “What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked around, as if afraid someone would overhear. “What’s going on? What
                        was stolen?
                        We’ve only got a few weeks!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, “I don’t…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Somebody knocked on the door, and the girl quickly filled my mouth with
                        pudding. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The next time I woke up, the girl was gone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A husky blond dude, like a surfer, stood in the corner of the bedroom keeping
                        watch over me. He
                        had blue eyes—at least a dozen of them—on his cheeks, his forehead, the backs of his hands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">When I finally came around for good, there was nothing weird about my
                        surroundings, except that
                        they were nicer than I was used to. I was sitting in a deck chair on a huge porch, gazing across
                        a meadow at
                        green hills in the distance. The breeze smelled like strawberries. There was a blanket over my
                        legs, a pillow
                        behind my neck. All that was great, but my mouth felt like a scorpion had been using it for a
                        nest. My tongue
                        was dry and nasty and every one of my teeth hurt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">On the table next to me was a tall drink. It looked like iced apple juice, with
                        a green straw
                        and a paper parasol stuck through a maraschino cherry. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My hand was so weak I almost dropped the glass once I got my fingers around it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Careful,” a familiar voice said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was leaning against the porch railing, looking like he hadn’t slept in a
                        week. Under one
                        arm, he cradled a shoe box. He was wearing blue jeans, Converse hi-tops and a bright orange
                        T-shirt that said
                        <small class="calibre4">CAMP HALF-BLOOD</small>. Just plain old Grover. Not the goat boy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">So maybe I’d had a nightmare. Maybe my mom was okay. We were still on vacation,
                        and we’d
                        stopped here at this big house for some reason. And…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You saved my life,” Grover said. “I…well, the least I could do…I went back to
                        the hill. I
                        thought you might want this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Reverently, he placed the shoe box in my lap. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Inside was a black-and-white bull’s horn, the base jagged from being broken
                        off, the tip
                        splattered with dried blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It hadn’t been a nightmare. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Minotaur,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um, Percy, it isn’t a good idea—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s what they call him in the Greek myths, isn’t it?” I demanded. “The
                        Minotaur. Half man,
                        half bull.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shifted uncomfortably. “You’ve been out for two days. How much do you
                        remember?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My mom. Is she really…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared across the meadow. There were groves of trees, a winding stream, acres
                        of strawberries
                        spread out under the blue sky. The valley was surrounded by rolling hills, and the tallest one,
                        directly in
                        front of us, was the one with the huge pine tree on top. Even that looked beautiful in the
                        sunlight. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/5-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother was gone. The whole world should be black and cold. Nothing should
                        look beautiful.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry,” Grover sniffled. “I’m a failure. I’m—I’m the worst satyr in the
                        world.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He moaned, stomping his foot so hard it came off. I mean, the Converse hi-top
                        came off. The
                        inside was filled with Styrofoam, except for a hoof-shaped hole. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Styx!” he mumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder rolled across the clear sky. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As he struggled to get his hoof back in the fake foot, I thought, Well, that
                        settles it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was a satyr. I was ready to bet that if I shaved his curly brown hair,
                        I’d find tiny
                        horns on his head. But I was too miserable to care that satyrs existed, or even minotaurs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All that meant was my mom really had been squeezed into nothingness, dissolved
                        into yellow
                        light. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was alone. An orphan. I would have to live with…Smelly Gabe? No. That would
                        never happen. I
                        would live on the streets first. I would pretend I was seventeen and join the army. I’d do
                        something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was still sniffling. The poor kid—poor goat, satyr, whatever—looked as
                        if he expected to
                        be hit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “It wasn’t your fault.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, it was. I was supposed to <em class="calibre5">protect </em>you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Did my mother ask you to protect me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. But that’s my job. I’m a keeper. At least…I was.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But why…” I suddenly felt dizzy, my vision swimming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t strain yourself,” Grover said. “Here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He helped me hold my glass and put the straw to my lips. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I recoiled at the taste, because I was expecting apple juice. It wasn’t that at
                        all. It was
                        chocolate-chip cookies. Liquid cookies. And not just any cookies—my mom’s homemade blue
                        chocolate-chip cookies,
                        buttery and hot, with the chips still melting. Drinking it, my whole body felt warm and good,
                        full of energy. My
                        grief didn’t go away, but I felt as if my mom had just brushed her hand against my cheek, given
                        me a cookie the
                        way she used to when I was small, and told me everything was going to be okay. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I knew it, I’d drained the glass. I stared into it, sure I’d just had a
                        warm drink, but
                        the ice cubes hadn’t even melted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Was it good?” Grover asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What did it taste like?” He sounded so wistful, I felt guilty. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sorry,” I said. “I should’ve let you taste.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His eyes got wide. “No! That’s not what I meant. I just…wondered.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chocolate-chip cookies,” I said. “My mom’s. Homemade.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He sighed. “And how do you feel?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Like I could throw Nancy Bobofit a hundred yards.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s good,” he said. “That’s good. I don’t think you could risk drinking any
                        more of that
                        stuff.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">He took the empty glass from me gingerly, as if it were dynamite, and set it
                        back on the table.
                        “Come on. Chiron and Mr. D are waiting.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The porch wrapped all the way around the farmhouse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My legs felt wobbly, trying to walk that far. Grover offered to carry the
                        Minotaur horn, but I
                        held on to it. I’d paid for that souvenir the hard way. I wasn’t going to let it go. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As we came around the opposite end of the house, I caught my breath. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We must’ve been on the north shore of Long Island, because on this side of the
                        house, the
                        valley marched all the way up to the water, which glittered about a mile in the distance.
                        Between here and
                        there, I simply couldn’t process everything I was seeing. The landscape was dotted with
                        buildings that looked
                        like ancient Greek architecture—an open-air pavilion, an amphitheater, a circular arena—except
                        that they all
                        looked brand new, their white marble columns sparkling in the sun. In a nearby sandpit, a dozen
                        high school–age
                        kids and satyrs played volleyball. Canoes glided across a small lake. Kids in bright orange
                        T-shirts like
                        Grover’s were chasing each other around a cluster of cabins nestled in the woods. Some shot
                        targets at an
                        archery range. Others rode horses down a wooded trail, and, unless I was hallucinating, some of
                        their horses had
                        wings. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Down at the end of the porch, two men sat across from each other at a card
                        table. The
                        blond-haired girl who’d spoon-fed me popcorn-flavored pudding was leaning on the porch rail next
                        to them. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The man facing me was small, but porky. He had a red nose, big watery eyes, and
                        curly hair so
                        black it was almost purple. He looked like those paintings of baby angels—what do you call them,
                        hubbubs? No,
                        cherubs. That’s it. He looked like a cherub who’d turned middle-aged in a trailer park. He wore
                        a tiger-pattern
                        Hawaiian shirt, and he would’ve fit right in at one of Gabe’s poker parties, except I got the
                        feeling this guy
                        could’ve out-gambled even my stepfather. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s Mr. D,” Grover murmured to me. “He’s the camp director. Be polite. The
                        girl, that’s
                        Annabeth Chase. She’s just a camper, but she’s been here longer than just about anybody. And you
                        already know
                        Chiron.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pointed at the guy whose back was to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">First, I realized he was sitting in the wheelchair. Then I recognized the tweed
                        jacket, the
                        thinning brown hair, the scraggly beard. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mr. Brunner!” I cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Latin teacher turned and smiled at me. His eyes had that mischievous glint
                        they sometimes
                        got in class when he pulled a pop quiz and made all the multiple choice answers <em
                            class="calibre5">B</em>.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/5-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah, good, Percy,” he said. “Now we have four for pinochle.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He offered me a chair to the right of Mr. D, who looked at me with bloodshot
                        eyes and heaved a
                        great sigh. “Oh, I suppose I must say it. Welcome to Camp Half-Blood. There. Now, don’t expect
                        me to be glad to
                        see you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh, thanks.” I scooted a little farther away from him because, if there was
                        one thing I had
                        learned from living with Gabe, it was how to tell when an adult has been hitting the happy
                        juice. If Mr. D was a
                        stranger to alcohol, I was a satyr. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Annabeth?” Mr. Brunner called to the blond girl. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She came forward and Mr. Brunner introduced us. “This young lady nursed you
                        back to health,
                        Percy. Annabeth, my dear, why don’t you go check on Percy’s bunk? We’ll be putting him in cabin
                        eleven for now.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “Sure, Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was probably my age, maybe a couple of inches taller, and a whole lot more
                        athletic
                        looking. With her deep tan and her curly blond hair, she was almost exactly what I thought a
                        stereotypical
                        California girl would look like, except her eyes ruined the image. They were startling gray,
                        like storm clouds;
                        pretty, but intimidating, too, as if she were analyzing the best way to take me down in a fight.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She glanced at the minotaur horn in my hands, then back at me. I imagined she
                        was going to say,
                        <em class="calibre5">You killed a mino</em><em class="calibre5">taur! </em>or <em
                            class="calibre5">Wow,
                            you’re
                            so awesome! </em>or something like that.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Instead she said, “You drool when you sleep.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she sprinted off down the lawn, her blond hair flying behind her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So,” I said, anxious to change the subject. “You, uh, work here, Mr. Brunner?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not Mr. Brunner,” the ex–Mr. Brunner said. “I’m afraid that was a pseudonym.
                        You may call me
                        Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay.” Totally confused, I looked at the director. “And Mr. D…does that stand
                        for something?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D stopped shuffling the cards. He looked at me like I’d just belched
                        loudly. “Young man,
                        names are powerful things. You don’t just go around using them for no reason.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh. Right. Sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I must say, Percy,” Chiron-Brunner broke in, “I’m glad to see you alive. It’s
                        been a long time
                        since I’ve made a house call to a potential camper. I’d hate to think I’ve wasted my time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“House call?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My year at Yancy Academy, to instruct you. We have satyrs at most schools, of
                        course, keeping
                        a lookout. But Grover alerted me as soon as he met you. He sensed you were something special, so
                        I decided to
                        come upstate. I convinced the other Latin teacher to…ah, take a leave of absence.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to remember the beginning of the school year. It seemed like so long
                        ago, but I did
                        have a fuzzy memory of there being another Latin teacher my first week at Yancy. Then, without
                        explanation, he
                        had disappeared and Mr. Brunner had taken the class. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You came to Yancy just to teach me?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron nodded. “Honestly, I wasn’t sure about you at first. We contacted your
                        mother, let her
                        know we were keeping an eye on you in case you were ready for Camp Half-Blood. But you still had
                        so much to
                        learn. Nevertheless, you made it here alive, and that’s always the first test.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover,” Mr. D said impatiently, “are you playing or not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, sir!” Grover trembled as he took the fourth chair, though I didn’t know
                        why he should be
                        so afraid of a pudgy little man in a tiger-print Hawaiian shirt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You <em class="calibre5">do </em>know how to play pinochle?” Mr. D eyed me
                        suspiciously. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m afraid not,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m afraid not, <em class="calibre5">sir</em>,” he said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sir,” I repeated. I was liking the camp director less and less. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well,” he told me, “it is, along with gladiator fighting and Pac-Man, one of
                        the greatest
                        games ever invented by humans. I would expect all <em class="calibre5">civilized </em>young men
                        to know the
                        rules.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sure the boy can learn,” Chiron said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Please,” I said, “what is this place? What am I doing here? Mr.
                        Brun—Chiron—why would you go
                        to Yancy Academy just to teach me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D snorted. “I asked the same question.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The camp director dealt the cards. Grover flinched every time one landed in his
                        pile. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron smiled at me sympathetically, the way he used to in Latin class, as if
                        to let me know
                        that no matter what my average was, <em class="calibre5">I </em>was his star student. He
                        expected <em class="calibre5">me </em>to have the right answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” he said. “Did your mother tell you nothing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She said…” I remembered her sad eyes, looking out over the sea. “She told me
                        she was afraid to
                        send me here, even though my father had wanted her to. She said that once I was here, I probably
                        couldn’t leave.
                        She wanted to keep me close to her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Typical,” Mr. D said. “That’s how they usually get killed. Young man, are you
                        bidding or not?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He explained, impatiently, how you bid in pinochle, and so I did. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m afraid there’s too much to tell,” Chiron said. “I’m afraid our usual
                        orientation film
                        won’t be sufficient.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Orientation film?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” Chiron decided. “Well, Percy. You know your friend Grover is a satyr. You
                        know”—he
                        pointed to the horn in the shoe box—“that you have killed the Minotaur. No small feat, either,
                        lad. What you may
                        not know is that great powers are at work in your life. Gods—the forces you call the Greek
                        gods—are very much
                        alive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the others around the table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I waited for somebody to yell, <em class="calibre5">Not! </em>But all I got was
                        Mr. D yelling,
                        “Oh, a royal marriage. Trick! Trick!” He cackled as he tallied up his points. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mr. D,” Grover asked timidly, “if you’re not going to eat it, could I have
                        your Diet Coke
                        can?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Eh? Oh, all right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover bit a huge shard out of the empty aluminum can and chewed it mournfully.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait,” I told Chiron. “You’re telling me there’s such a thing as God.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, now,” Chiron said. “God—capital <em class="calibre5">G</em>, God. That’s
                        a different
                        matter altogether. We shan’t deal with the metaphysical.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Metaphysical? But you were just talking about—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah, gods, plural, as in, great beings that control the forces of nature and
                        human endeavors:
                        the immortal gods of Olympus. That’s a smaller matter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Smaller?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, quite. The gods we discussed in Latin class.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Zeus,” I said. “Hera. Apollo. You mean them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And there it was again—distant thunder on a cloudless day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Young man,” said Mr. D, “I would really be less casual about throwing those
                        names around, if I
                        were you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But they’re stories,” I said. “They’re—myths, to explain lightning and the
                        seasons and stuff.
                        They’re what people believed before there was science.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Science!” Mr. D scoffed. “And tell me, Perseus Jackson”—I flinched when he
                        said my real name,
                        which I never told anybody—“what will people think of your ‘science’ two thousand years from
                        now?” Mr. D
                        continued. “Hmm? They will call it primitive mumbo jumbo. That’s what. Oh, I love mortals—they
                        have absolutely
                        no sense of perspective. They think they’ve come <em class="calibre5">so-o-o </em>far. And have
                        they, Chiron?
                        Look at this boy and tell me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t liking Mr. D much, but there was something about the way he called me
                        mortal, as if…he
                        wasn’t. It was enough to put a lump in my throat, to suggest why Grover was dutifully minding
                        his cards, chewing
                        his soda can, and keeping his mouth shut. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Chiron said, “you may choose to believe or not, but the fact is that
                        <em class="calibre5">immortal </em>means immortal. Can you imagine that for a moment, never
                        dying? Never fading?
                        Existing, just as you are, for all time?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to answer, off the top of my head, that it sounded like a pretty
                        good deal, but the
                        tone of Chiron’s voice made me hesitate. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean, whether people believed in you or not,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Exactly,” Chiron agreed. “If you were a god, how would you like being called a
                        myth, an old
                        story to explain lightning? What if I told you, Perseus Jackson, that someday people would call
                        <em class="calibre5">you </em>a myth, just created to explain how little boys can get over
                        losing their
                        mothers?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My heart pounded. He was trying to make me angry for some reason, but I wasn’t
                        going to let
                        him. I said, “I wouldn’t like it. But I don’t believe in gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, you’d better,” Mr. D murmured. “Before one of them incinerates you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover said, “P-please, sir. He’s just lost his mother. He’s in shock.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A lucky thing, too,” Mr. D grumbled, playing a card. “Bad enough I’m confined
                        to this
                        miserable job, working with boys who don’t even believe!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He waved his hand and a goblet appeared on the table, as if the sunlight had
                        bent, momentarily,
                        and woven the air into glass. The goblet filled itself with red wine. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My jaw dropped, but Chiron hardly looked up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mr. D,” he warned, “your restrictions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D looked at the wine and feigned surprise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Dear me.” He looked at the sky and yelled, “Old habits! Sorry!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">More thunder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D waved his hand again, and the wineglass changed into a fresh can of Diet
                        Coke. He sighed
                        unhappily, popped the top of the soda, and went back to his card game. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron winked at me. “Mr. D offended his father a while back, took a fancy to a
                        wood nymph who
                        had been declared off-limits.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A wood nymph,” I repeated, still staring at the Diet Coke can like it was from
                        outer space.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes,” Mr. D confessed. “Father loves to punish me. The first time,
                        Prohibition. Ghastly!
                        Absolutely horrid ten years! The second time—well, she really was pretty, and I couldn’t stay
                        away—the second
                        time, he sent me here. Half-Blood Hill. Summer camp for brats like you. ‘Be a better influence,’
                        he told me.
                        ‘Work with youths rather than tearing them down.’ Ha! Absolutely unfair.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D sounded about six years old, like a pouting little kid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And…” I stammered, “your father is…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">Di immortales</em>, Chiron,” Mr. D said. “I thought you
                        taught this boy
                        the basics. My father is Zeus, of course.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I ran through D names from Greek mythology. Wine. The skin of a tiger. The
                        satyrs that all
                        seemed to work here. The way Grover cringed, as if Mr. D were his master. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re Dionysus,” I said. “The god of wine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D rolled his eyes. “What do they say, these days, Grover? Do the children
                        say, ‘Well,
                        duh!’?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Y-yes, Mr. D.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then, well, duh! Percy Jackson. Did you think I was Aphrodite, perhaps?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re a god.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, child.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A god. You.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He turned to look at me straight on, and I saw a kind of purplish fire in his
                        eyes, a hint that
                        this whiny, plump little man was only showing me the tiniest bit of his true nature. I saw
                        visions of grape
                        vines choking unbelievers to death, drunken warriors insane with battle lust, sailors screaming
                        as their hands
                        turned to flippers, their faces elongating into dolphin snouts. I knew that if I pushed him, Mr.
                        D would show me
                        worse things. He would plant a disease in my brain that would leave me wearing a straitjacket in
                        a rubber room
                        for the rest of my life. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Would you like to test me, child?” he said quietly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. No, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The fire died a little. He turned back to his card game. “I believe I win.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not quite, Mr. D,” Chiron said. He set down a straight, tallied the points,
                        and said, “The
                        game goes to me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought Mr. D was going to vaporize Chiron right out of his wheelchair, but
                        he just sighed
                        through his nose, as if he were used to being beaten by the Latin teacher. He got up, and Grover
                        rose, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m tired,” Mr. D said. “I believe I’ll take a nap before the sing-along
                        tonight. But first,
                        Grover, we need to talk, <em class="calibre5">again, </em>about your less-than-perfect
                        performance on this
                        assignment.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover’s face beaded with sweat. “Y-yes, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D turned to me. “Cabin eleven, Percy Jackson. And mind your manners.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He swept into the farmhouse, Grover following miserably. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Will Grover be okay?” I asked Chiron. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron nodded, though he looked a bit troubled. “Old Dionysus isn’t really mad.
                        He just hates
                        his job. He’s been…ah, grounded, I guess you would say, and he can’t stand waiting another
                        century before he’s
                        allowed to go back to Olympus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mount Olympus,” I said. “You’re telling me there really is a palace there?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well now, there’s Mount Olympus in Greece. And then there’s the home of the
                        gods, the
                        convergence point of their powers, which did indeed used to be on Mount Olympus. It’s still
                        called Mount
                        Olympus, out of respect to the old ways, but the palace moves, Percy, just as the gods do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean the Greek gods are here? Like…in <em class="calibre5">America</em>?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, certainly. The gods move with the heart of the West.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come now, Percy. What you call ‘Western civilization.’ Do you think it’s just
                        an abstract
                        concept? No, it’s a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for
                        thousands of years. The
                        gods are part of it. You might even say they are the source of it, or at least, they are tied so
                        tightly to it
                        that they couldn’t possibly fade, not unless all of Western civilization were obliterated. The
                        fire started in
                        Greece. Then, as you well know—or as I hope you know, since you passed my course—the heart of
                        the fire moved to
                        Rome, and so did the gods. Oh, different names, perhaps—Jupiter for Zeus, Venus for Aphrodite,
                        and so on—but the
                        same forces, the same gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And then they died.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Died? No. Did the West die? The gods simply moved, to Germany, to France, to
                        Spain, for a
                        while. Wherever the flame was brightest, the gods were there. They spent several centuries in
                        England. All you
                        need to do is look at the architecture. People do not forget the gods. Every place they’ve
                        ruled, for the last
                        three thousand years, you can see them in paintings, in statues, on the most important
                        buildings. And yes,
                        Percy, of course they are now in your United States. Look at your symbol, the eagle of Zeus.
                        Look at the statue
                        of Prometheus in Rockefeller Center, the Greek facades of your government buildings in
                        Washington. I defy you to
                        find any American city where the Olympians are not prominently displayed in multiple places.
                        Like it or not—and
                        believe me, plenty of people weren’t very fond of Rome, either—America is now the heart of the
                        flame. It is the
                        great power of the West. And so Olympus is here. And we are here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was all too much, especially the fact that <em class="calibre5">I
                        </em>seemed to be included
                        in Chiron’s <em class="calibre5">we</em>, as if I were part of some club. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who are you, Chiron? Who…who am I?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron smiled. He shifted his weight as if he were going to get up out of his
                        wheelchair, but I
                        knew that was impossible. He was paralyzed from the waist down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who are you?” he mused. “Well, that’s the question we all want answered, isn’t
                        it? But for
                        now, we should get you a bunk in cabin eleven. There will be new friends to meet. And plenty of
                        time for lessons
                        tomorrow. Besides, there will be s’mores at the campfire tonight, and I simply adore chocolate.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And then he did rise from his wheelchair. But there was something odd about the
                        way he did it.
                        His blanket fell away from his legs, but the legs didn’t move. His waist kept getting longer,
                        rising above his
                        belt. At first, I thought he was wearing very long, white velvet underwear, but as he kept
                        rising out of the
                        chair, taller than any man, I realized that the velvet underwear wasn’t underwear; it was the
                        front of an
                        animal, muscle and sinew under coarse white fur. And the wheelchair wasn’t a chair. It was some
                        kind of
                        container, an enormous box on wheels, and it must’ve been magic, because there’s no way it
                        could’ve held all of
                        him. A leg came out, long and knobby-kneed, with a huge polished hoof. Then another front leg,
                        then
                        hindquarters, and then the box was empty, nothing but a metal shell with a couple of fake human
                        legs attached.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the horse who had just sprung from the wheelchair: a huge white
                        stallion. But where
                        its neck should be was the upper body of my Latin teacher, smoothly grafted to the horse’s
                        trunk. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What a relief,” the centaur said. “I’d been cooped up in there so long, my
                        fetlocks had fallen
                        asleep. Now, come, Percy Jackson. Let’s meet the other campers.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">O</span>nce I got over the fact that my Latin teacher was
                        a horse, we had
                        a nice tour, though I was careful not to walk behind him. I’d done pooper-scooper patrol in the
                        Macy’s
                        Thanksgiving Day Parade a few times, and, I’m sorry, I did not trust Chiron’s back end the way I
                        trusted his
                        front. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We passed the volleyball pit. Several of the campers nudged each other. One
                        pointed to the
                        minotaur horn I was carrying. Another said, “That’s <em class="calibre5">him</em>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Most of the campers were older than me. Their satyr friends were bigger than
                        Grover, all of
                        them trotting around in orange <small class="calibre4">CAMP HALF-BLOOD</small> T-shirts, with
                        nothing else to
                        cover their bare shaggy hindquarters. I wasn’t normally shy, but the way they stared at me made
                        me
                        uncomfortable. I felt like they were expecting me to do a flip or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked back at the farmhouse. It was a lot bigger than I’d realized—four
                        stories tall, sky
                        blue with white trim, like an upscale seaside resort. I was checking out the brass eagle weather
                        vane on top
                        when something caught my eye, a shadow in the uppermost window of the attic gable. Something had
                        moved the
                        curtain, just for a second, and I got the distinct impression I was being watched. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s up there?” I asked Chiron. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked where I was pointing, and his smile faded. “Just the attic.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Somebody lives there?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” he said with finality. “Not a single living thing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got the feeling he was being truthful. But I was also sure something had
                        moved that curtain.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Come along, Percy,” Chiron said, his lighthearted tone now a little forced.
                        “Lots to see.”
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">We walked through the strawberry fields, where campers were picking bushels of
                        berries while a
                        satyr played a tune on a reed pipe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron told me the camp grew a nice crop for export to New York restaurants and
                        Mount Olympus.
                        “It pays our expenses,” he explained. “And the strawberries take almost no effort.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He said Mr. D had this effect on fruit-bearing plants: they just went crazy
                        when he was around.
                        It worked best with wine grapes, but Mr. D was restricted from growing those, so they grew
                        strawberries instead.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I watched the satyr playing his pipe. His music was causing lines of bugs to
                        leave the
                        strawberry patch in every direction, like refugees fleeing a fire. I wondered if Grover could
                        work that kind of
                        magic with music. I wondered if he was still inside the farmhouse, getting chewed out by Mr. D.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover won’t get in too much trouble, will he?” I asked Chiron. “I mean…he was
                        a good
                        protector. Really.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron sighed. He shed his tweed jacket and draped it over his horse’s back
                        like a saddle.
                        “Grover has big dreams, Percy. Perhaps bigger than are reasonable. To reach his goal, he must
                        first demonstrate
                        great courage by succeeding as a keeper, finding a new camper and bringing him safely to
                        Half-Blood Hill.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But he did that!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I might agree with you,” Chiron said. “But it is not my place to judge.
                        Dionysus and the
                        Council of Cloven Elders must decide. I’m afraid they might not see this assignment as a
                        success. After all,
                        Grover lost you in New York. Then there’s the unfortunate…ah…fate of your mother. And the fact
                        that Grover was
                        unconscious when you dragged him over the property line. The council might question whether this
                        shows any
                        courage on Grover’s part.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to protest. None of what happened was Grover’s fault. I also felt
                        really, really
                        guilty. If I hadn’t given Grover the slip at the bus station, he might not have gotten in
                        trouble. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’ll get a second chance, won’t he?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron winced. “I’m afraid that <em class="calibre5">was </em>Grover’s second
                        chance, Percy.
                        The council was not anxious to give him another, either, after what happened the first time,
                        five years ago.
                        Olympus knows, I advised him to wait longer before trying again. He’s still so small for his
                        age.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How old is he?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, twenty-eight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What! And he’s in sixth grade?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Satyrs mature half as fast as humans, Percy. Grover has been the equivalent of
                        a middle school
                        student for the past six years.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s horrible.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Quite,” Chiron agreed. “At any rate, Grover is a late bloomer, even by satyr
                        standards, and
                        not yet very accomplished at woodland magic. Alas, he was anxious to pursue his dream. Perhaps
                        now he will find
                        some other career.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s not fair,” I said. “What happened the first time? Was it really so
                        bad?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron looked away quickly. “Let’s move along, shall we?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But I wasn’t quite ready to let the subject drop. Something had occurred to me
                        when Chiron
                        talked about my mother’s fate, as if he were intentionally avoiding the word <em
                            class="calibre5">death</em>.
                        The beginnings of an idea—a tiny, hopeful fire—started forming in my mind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chiron,” I said. “If the gods and Olympus and all that are real…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, child?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Does that mean the Underworld is real, too?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron’s expression darkened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, child.” He paused, as if choosing his words carefully. “There is a place
                        where spirits go
                        after death. But for now…until we know more…I would urge you to put that out of your mind.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean, ‘until we know more’?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Come, Percy. Let’s see the woods.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">As we got closer, I realized how huge the forest was. It took up at least a
                        quarter of the
                        valley, with trees so tall and thick, you could imagine nobody had been in there since the
                        Native Americans.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron said, “The woods are stocked, if you care to try your luck, but go
                        armed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stocked with what?” I asked. “Armed with what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ll see. Capture the flag is Friday night. Do you have your own sword and
                        shield?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My own—?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” Chiron said. “I don’t suppose you do. I think a size five will do. I’ll
                        visit the armory
                        later.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to ask what kind of summer camp had an armory, but there was too much
                        else to think
                        about, so the tour continued. We saw the archery range, the canoeing lake, the stables (which
                        Chiron didn’t seem
                        to like very much), the javelin range, the sing-along amphitheater, and the arena where Chiron
                        said they held
                        sword and spear fights. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sword and spear fights?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cabin challenges and all that,” he explained. “Not lethal. Usually. Oh, yes,
                        and there’s the
                        mess hall.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron pointed to an outdoor pavilion framed in white Grecian columns on a hill
                        overlooking the
                        sea. There were a dozen stone picnic tables. No roof. No walls. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you do when it rains?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron looked at me as if I’d gone a little weird. “We still have to eat, don’t
                        we?” I decided
                        to drop the subject. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, he showed me the cabins. There were twelve of them, nestled in the
                        woods by the lake.
                        They were arranged in a U, with two at the base and five in a row on either side. And they were
                        without doubt
                        the most bizarre collection of buildings I’d ever seen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Except for the fact that each had a large brass number above the door (odds on
                        the left side,
                        evens on the right), they looked absolutely nothing alike. Number nine had smokestacks, like a
                        tiny factory.
                        Number four had tomato vines on the walls and a roof made out of real grass. Seven seemed to be
                        made of solid
                        gold, which gleamed so much in the sunlight it was almost impossible to look at. They all faced
                        a commons area
                        about the size of a soccer field, dotted with Greek statues, fountains, flower beds, and a
                        couple of basketball
                        hoops (which were more my speed). </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the center of the field was a huge stone-lined firepit. Even though it was a
                        warm afternoon,
                        the hearth smoldered. A girl about nine years old was tending the flames, poking the coals with
                        a stick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The pair of cabins at the head of the field, numbers one and two, looked like
                        his-and-hers
                        mausoleums, big white marble boxes with heavy columns in front. Cabin one was the biggest and
                        bulkiest of the
                        twelve. Its polished bronze doors shimmered like a hologram, so that from different angles
                        lightning bolts
                        seemed to streak across them. Cabin two was more graceful somehow, with slimmer columns
                        garlanded with
                        pomegranates and flowers. The walls were carved with images of peacocks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Zeus and Hera?” I guessed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Correct,” Chiron said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Their cabins look empty.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Several of the cabins are. That’s true. No one ever stays in one or two.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Okay. So each cabin had a different god, like a mascot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Twelve cabins for the twelve Olympians. But why would some be empty? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stopped in front of the first cabin on the left, cabin three. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It wasn’t high and mighty like cabin one, but long and low and solid. The outer
                        walls were of
                        rough gray stone studded with pieces of seashell and coral, as if the slabs had been hewn
                        straight from the
                        bottom of the ocean floor. I peeked inside the open doorway and Chiron said, “Oh, I wouldn’t do
                        that!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before he could pull me back, I caught the salty scent of the interior, like
                        the wind on the
                        shore at Montauk. The interior walls glowed like abalone. There were six empty bunk beds with
                        silk sheets turned
                        down. But there was no sign anyone had ever slept there. The place felt so sad and lonely, I was
                        glad when
                        Chiron put his hand on my shoulder and said, “Come along, Percy.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/6-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Most of the other cabins were crowded with campers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Number five was bright red—a real nasty paint job, as if the color had been
                        splashed on with
                        buckets and fists. The roof was lined with barbed wire. A stuffed wild boar’s head hung over the
                        doorway, and
                        its eyes seemed to follow me. Inside I could see a bunch of mean-looking kids, both girls and
                        boys, arm
                        wrestling and arguing with each other while rock music blared. The loudest was a girl maybe
                        thirteen or
                        fourteen. She wore a size XXXL <small class="calibre4">CAMP HALFBLOOD</small> T-shirt under a
                        camouflage jacket.
                        She zeroed in on me and gave me an evil sneer. She reminded me of Nancy Bobofit, though the
                        camper girl was much
                        bigger and tougher looking, and her hair was long and stringy, and brown instead of red. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I kept walking, trying to stay clear of Chiron’s hooves. “We haven’t seen any
                        other centaurs,”
                        I observed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” said Chiron sadly. “My kinsmen are a wild and barbaric folk, I’m afraid.
                        You might
                        encounter them in the wilderness, or at major sporting events. But you won’t see any here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You said your name was Chiron. Are you really…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He smiled down at me. “<em class="calibre5">The </em>Chiron from the stories?
                        Trainer of
                        Hercules and all that? Yes, Percy, I am.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But, shouldn’t you be dead?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron paused, as if the question intrigued him. “I honestly don’t know about
                        <em class="calibre5">should </em>be. The truth is, I <em class="calibre5">can’t </em>be dead.
                        You see, eons ago
                        the gods granted my wish. I could continue the work I loved. I could be a teacher of heroes as
                        long as humanity
                        needed me. I gained much from that wish…and I gave up much. But I’m still here, so I can only
                        assume I’m still
                        needed.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about being a teacher for three thousand years. It wouldn’t have made
                        my Top Ten
                        Things to Wish For list. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Doesn’t it ever get boring?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, no,” he said. “Horribly depressing, at times, but never boring.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why depressing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron seemed to turn hard of hearing again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, look,” he said. “Annabeth is waiting for us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The blond girl I’d met at the Big House was reading a book in front of the last
                        cabin on the
                        left, number eleven. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When we reached her, she looked me over critically, like she was still thinking
                        about how much
                        I drooled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to see what she was reading, but I couldn’t make out the title. I
                        thought my dyslexia
                        was acting up. Then I realized the title wasn’t even English. The letters looked Greek to me. I
                        mean, literally
                        Greek. There were pictures of temples and statues and different kinds of columns, like those in
                        an architecture
                        book. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Annabeth,” Chiron said, “I have masters’ archery class at noon. Would you take
                        Percy from
                        here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cabin eleven,” Chiron told me, gesturing toward the doorway. “Make yourself at
                        home.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Out of all the cabins, eleven looked the most like a regular old summer camp
                        cabin, with the
                        emphasis on <em class="calibre5">old</em>. The threshold was worn down, the brown paint peeling.
                        Over the
                        doorway was one of those doctor’s symbols, a winged pole with two snakes wrapped around it. What
                        did they call
                        it…? A caduceus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Inside, it was packed with people, both boys and girls, way more than the
                        number of bunk beds.
                        Sleeping bags were spread all over on the floor. It looked like a gym where the Red Cross had
                        set up an
                        evacuation center. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron didn’t go in. The door was too low for him. But when the campers saw him
                        they all stood
                        and bowed respectfully. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, then,” Chiron said. “Good luck, Percy. I’ll see you at dinner.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He galloped away toward the archery range. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stood in the doorway, looking at the kids. They weren’t bowing anymore. They
                        were staring at
                        me, sizing me up. I knew this routine. I’d gone through it at enough schools. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well?” Annabeth prompted. “Go on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">So naturally I tripped coming in the door and made a total fool of myself.
                        There were some
                        snickers from the campers, but none of them said anything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth announced, “Percy Jackson, meet cabin eleven.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Regular or undetermined?” somebody asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what to say, but Annabeth said, “Undetermined.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Everybody groaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A guy who was a little older than the rest came forward. “Now, now, campers.
                        That’s what we’re
                        here for. Welcome, Percy. You can have that spot on the floor, right over there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The guy was about nineteen, and he looked pretty cool. He was tall and
                        muscular, with
                        short-cropped sandy hair and a friendly smile. He wore an orange tank top, cutoffs, sandals, and
                        a leather
                        necklace with five different-colored clay beads. The only thing unsettling about his appearance
                        was a thick
                        white scar that ran from just beneath his right eye to his jaw, like an old knife slash. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is Luke,” Annabeth said, and her voice sounded different somehow. I
                        glanced over and
                        could’ve sworn she was blushing. She saw me looking, and her expression hardened again. “He’s
                        your counselor for
                        now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“For now?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re undetermined,” Luke explained patiently. “They don’t know what cabin to
                        put you in, so
                        you’re here. Cabin eleven takes all newcomers, all visitors. Naturally, we would. Hermes, our
                        patron, is the god
                        of travelers.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/6-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at the tiny section of floor they’d given me. I had nothing to put
                        there to mark it as
                        my own, no luggage, no clothes, no sleeping bag. Just the Minotaur’s horn. I thought about
                        setting that down,
                        but then I remembered that Hermes was also the god of thieves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked around at the campers’ faces, some sullen and suspicious, some
                        grinning stupidly, some
                        eyeing me as if they were waiting for a chance to pick my pockets. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How long will I be here?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good question,” Luke said. “Until you’re determined.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How long will that take?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The campers all laughed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on,” Annabeth told me. “I’ll show you the volleyball court.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve already seen it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">She grabbed my wrist and dragged me outside. I could hear the kids of cabin
                        eleven laughing
                        behind me. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">When we were a few feet away, Annabeth said, “Jackson, you have to do better
                        than that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She rolled her eyes and mumbled under her breath, “I can’t believe I thought
                        you were the one.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s your problem?” I was getting angry now. “All I know is, I kill some
                        bull guy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t talk like that!” Annabeth told me. “You know how many kids at this camp
                        wish they’d had
                        your chance?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“To get killed?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“To fight the Minotaur! What do you think we train for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shook my head. “Look, if the thing I fought really was <em
                            class="calibre5">the
                        </em>Minotaur, the same one in the stories…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then there’s only one.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And he died, like, a gajillion years ago, right? Theseus killed him in the
                        labyrinth. So…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Monsters don’t die, Percy. They can be killed. But they don’t die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, thanks. That clears it up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They don’t have souls, like you and me. You can dispel them for a while, maybe
                        even for a
                        whole lifetime if you’re lucky. But they are primal forces. Chiron calls them archetypes.
                        Eventually, they
                        re-form.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about Mrs. Dodds. “You mean if I killed one, accidentally, with a
                        sword—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Fur…I mean, your math teacher. That’s right. She’s still out there. You
                        just made her
                        very, very mad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How did you know about Mrs. Dodds?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You talk in your sleep.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You almost called her something. A Fury? They’re Hades’ torturers, right?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth glanced nervously at the ground, as if she expected it to open up and
                        swallow her.
                        “You shouldn’t call them by name, even here. We call them the Kindly Ones, if we have to speak
                        of them at all.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, is there anything we <em class="calibre5">can </em>say without it
                        thundering?” I sounded
                        whiny, even to myself, but right then I didn’t care. “Why do I have to stay in cabin eleven,
                        anyway? Why is
                        everybody so crowded together? There are plenty of empty bunks right over there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I pointed to the first few cabins, and Annabeth turned pale. “You don’t just
                        choose a cabin,
                        Percy. It depends on who your parents are. Or…your parent.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She stared at me, waiting for me to get it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My mom is Sally Jackson,” I said. “She works at the candy store in Grand
                        Central Station. At
                        least, she used to.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry about your mom, Percy. But that’s not what I mean. I’m talking about
                        your other
                        parent. Your dad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s dead. I never knew him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth sighed. Clearly, she’d had this conversation before with other kids.
                        “Your father’s
                        not dead, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How can you say that? You know him?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, of course not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then how can you say—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because I know <em class="calibre5">you</em>. You wouldn’t be here if you
                        weren’t one of us.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You don’t know anything about me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No?” She raised an eyebrow. “I bet you moved around from school to school. I
                        bet you were
                        kicked out of a lot of them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Diagnosed with dyslexia. Probably ADHD, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to swallow my embarrassment. “What does that have to do with anything?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Taken together, it’s almost a sure sign. The letters float off the page when
                        you read, right?
                        That’s because your mind is hardwired for ancient Greek. And the ADHD—you’re impulsive, can’t
                        sit still in the
                        classroom. That’s your battlefield reflexes. In a real fight, they’d keep you alive. As for the
                        attention
                        problems, that’s because you see too much, Percy, not too little. Your senses are better than a
                        regular
                        mortal’s. Of course the teachers want you medicated. Most of them are monsters. They don’t want
                        you seeing them
                        for what they are.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You sound like…you went through the same thing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Most of the kids here did. If you weren’t like us, you couldn’t have survived
                        the Minotaur,
                        much less the ambrosia and nectar.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ambrosia and nectar.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The food and drink we were giving you to make you better. That stuff would’ve
                        killed a normal
                        kid. It would’ve turned your blood to fire and your bones to sand and you’d be dead. Face it.
                        You’re a
                        half-blood.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A half-blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was reeling with so many questions I didn’t know where to start. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then a husky voice yelled, “Well! A newbie!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked over. The big girl from the ugly red cabin was sauntering toward us.
                        She had three
                        other girls behind her, all big and ugly and mean looking like her, all wearing camo jackets.

                    <p class="calibre14">“Clarisse,” Annabeth sighed. “Why don’t you go polish your spear or something?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sure, Miss Princess,” the big girl said. “So I can run you through with it
                        Friday night.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“Erre es korakas!” </em>Annabeth said, which I somehow
                        understood was
                        Greek for ‘Go to the crows!’ though I had a feeling it was a worse curse than it sounded. “You
                        don’t stand a
                        chance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll pulverize you,” Clarisse said, but her eye twitched. Perhaps she wasn’t
                        sure she could
                        follow through on the threat. She turned toward me. “Who’s this little runt?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy Jackson,” Annabeth said, “meet Clarisse, Daughter of Ares.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked. “Like…the war god?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse sneered. “You got a problem with that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I said, recovering my wits. “It explains the bad smell.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse growled. “We got an initiation ceremony for newbies, Prissy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whatever. Come on, I’ll show you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Clarisse—” Annabeth tried to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stay out of it, wise girl.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth looked pained, but she did stay out of it, and I didn’t really want
                        her help. I was
                        the new kid. I had to earn my own rep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I handed Annabeth my minotaur horn and got ready to fight, but before I knew
                        it, Clarisse had
                        me by the neck and was dragging me toward a cinder-block building that I knew immediately was
                        the bathroom. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was kicking and punching. I’d been in plenty of fights before, but this big
                        girl Clarisse had
                        hands like iron. She dragged me into the girls’ bathroom. There was a line of toilets on one
                        side and a line of
                        shower stalls down the other. It smelled just like any public bathroom, and I was thinking—as
                        much as I <em class="calibre5">could </em>think with Clarisse ripping my hair out—that if this
                        place belonged to the gods,
                        they should’ve been able to afford classier johns. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse’s friends were all laughing, and I was trying to find the strength I’d
                        used to fight
                        the Minotaur, but it just wasn’t there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Like he’s ‘Big Three’ material,” Clarisse said as she pushed me toward one of
                        the toilets.
                        “Yeah, right. Minotaur probably fell over laughing, he was so stupid looking.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her friends snickered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stood in the corner, watching through her fingers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse bent me over on my knees and started pushing my head toward the toilet
                        bowl. It reeked
                        like rusted pipes and, well, like what goes into toilets. I strained to keep my head up. I was
                        looking at the
                        scummy water, thinking, I will not go into that. I won’t. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then something happened. I felt a tug in the pit of my stomach. I heard the
                        plumbing rumble,
                        the pipes shudder. Clarisse’s grip on my hair loosened. Water shot out of the toilet, making an
                        arc straight
                        over my head, and the next thing I knew, I was sprawled on the bathroom tiles with Clarisse
                        screaming behind me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned just as water blasted out of the toilet again, hitting Clarisse
                        straight in the face
                        so hard it pushed her down onto her butt. The water stayed on her like the spray from a fire
                        hose, pushing her
                        backward into a shower stall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She struggled, gasping, and her friends started coming toward her. But then the
                        other toilets
                        exploded, too, and six more streams of toilet water blasted them back. The showers acted up,
                        too, and together
                        all the fixtures sprayed the camouflage girls right out of the bathroom, spinning them around
                        like pieces of
                        garbage being washed away. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/6-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">As soon as they were out the door, I felt the tug in my gut lessen, and the
                        water shut off as
                        quickly as it had started. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The entire bathroom was flooded. Annabeth hadn’t been spared. She was dripping
                        wet, but she
                        hadn’t been pushed out the door. She was standing in exactly the same place, staring at me in
                        shock. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked down and realized I was sitting in the only dry spot in the whole
                        room. There was a
                        circle of dry floor around me. I didn’t have one drop of water on my clothes. Nothing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stood up, my legs shaky. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “How did you…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We walked to the door. Outside, Clarisse and her friends were sprawled in the
                        mud, and a bunch
                        of other campers had gathered around to gawk. Clarisse’s hair was flattened across her face. Her
                        camouflage
                        jacket was sopping and she smelled like sewage. She gave me a look of absolute hatred. “You are
                        dead, new boy.
                        You are totally dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I probably should have let it go, but I said, “You want to gargle with toilet
                        water again,
                        Clarisse? Close your mouth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her friends had to hold her back. They dragged her toward cabin five, while the
                        other campers
                        made way to avoid her flailing feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stared at me. I couldn’t tell whether she was just grossed out or
                        angry at me for
                        dousing her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” I demanded. “What are you thinking?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m thinking,” she said, “that I want you on my team for capture the flag.”

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">W</span>ord of the bathroom incident spread immediately.
                        Wherever I went,
                        campers pointed at me and murmured something about toilet water. Or maybe they were just staring
                        at Annabeth,
                        who was still pretty much dripping wet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She showed me a few more places: the metal shop (where kids were forging their
                        own swords), the
                        arts-and-crafts room (where satyrs were sandblasting a giant marble statue of a goat-man), and
                        the climbing
                        wall, which actually consisted of two facing walls that shook violently, dropped boulders,
                        sprayed lava, and
                        clashed together if you didn’t get to the top fast enough. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally we returned to the canoeing lake, where the trail led back to the
                        cabins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve got training to do,” Annabeth said flatly. “Dinner’s at seven-thirty.
                        Just follow your
                        cabin to the mess hall.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Annabeth, I’m sorry about the toilets.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whatever.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It wasn’t my fault.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked at me skeptically, and I realized it <em class="calibre5">was
                        </em>my fault. I’d
                        made water shoot out of the bathroom fixtures. I didn’t understand how. But the toilets had
                        responded to me. I
                        had become one with the plumbing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You need to talk to the Oracle,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not who. What. The Oracle. I’ll ask Chiron.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared into the lake, wishing somebody would give me a straight answer for
                        once. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t expecting anybody to be looking back at me from the bottom, so my
                        heart skipped a beat
                        when I noticed two teenage girls sitting cross-legged at the base of the pier, about twenty feet
                        below. They
                        wore blue jeans and shimmering green T-shirts, and their brown hair floated loose around their
                        shoulders as
                        minnows darted in and out. They smiled and waved as if I were a long-lost friend. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what else to do. I waved back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t encourage them,” Annabeth warned. “Naiads are terrible flirts.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Naiads,” I repeated, feeling completely overwhelmed. “That’s it. I want to go
                        home now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth frowned. “Don’t you get it, Percy? You <em class="calibre5">are
                        </em>home. This is the
                        only safe place on earth for kids like us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean, mentally disturbed kids?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I mean <em class="calibre5">not human</em>. Not totally human, anyway.
                        Half-human.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Half-human and half-what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I think you know.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/7-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t want to admit it, but I was afraid I did. I felt a tingling in my
                        limbs, a sensation I
                        sometimes felt when my mom talked about my dad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“God,” I said. “Half-god.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth nodded. “Your father isn’t dead, Percy. He’s one of the Olympians.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s…crazy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Is it? What’s the most common thing gods did in the old stories? They ran
                        around falling in
                        love with humans and having kids with them. Do you think they’ve changed their habits in the
                        last few
                        millennia?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But those are just—” I almost said <em class="calibre5">myths </em>again. Then
                        I remembered
                        Chiron’s warning that in two thousand years, <em class="calibre5">I </em>might be considered a
                        myth. “But if all
                        the kids here are half-gods—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Demigods,” Annabeth said. “That’s the official term. Or half-bloods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then who’s your dad?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her hands tightened around the pier railing. I got the feeling I’d just
                        trespassed on a
                        sensitive subject. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My dad is a professor at West Point,” she said. “I haven’t seen him since I
                        was very small. He
                        teaches American history.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s human.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What? You assume it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive?
                        How sexist is
                        that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who’s your mom, then?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cabin six.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Meaning?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth straightened. “Athena. Goddess of wisdom and battle.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Okay, I thought. Why not? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And my dad?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Undetermined,” Annabeth said, “like I told you before. Nobody knows.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Except my mother. She knew.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe not, Percy. Gods don’t always reveal their identities.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My dad would have. He loved her.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth gave me a cautious look. She didn’t want to burst my bubble. “Maybe
                        you’re right.
                        Maybe he’ll send a sign. That’s the only way to know for sure: your father has to send you a
                        sign claiming you
                        as his son. Sometimes it happens.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean sometimes it doesn’t?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth ran her palm along the rail. “The gods are busy. They have a lot of
                        kids and they
                        don’t always…Well, sometimes they don’t care about us, Percy. They ignore us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about some of the kids I’d seen in the Hermes cabin, teenagers who
                        looked sullen and
                        depressed, as if they were waiting for a call that would never come. I’d known kids like that at
                        Yancy Academy,
                        shuffled off to boarding school by rich parents who didn’t have the time to deal with them. But
                        gods should
                        behave better. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So I’m stuck here,” I said. “That’s it? For the rest of my life?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It depends,” Annabeth said. “Some campers only stay the summer. If you’re a
                        child of Aphrodite
                        or Demeter, you’re probably not a real powerful force. The monsters might ignore you, so you can
                        get by with a
                        few months of summer training and live in the mortal world the rest of the year. But for some of
                        us, it’s too
                        dangerous to leave. We’re year-rounders. In the mortal world, we attract monsters. They sense
                        us. They come to
                        challenge us. Most of the time, they’ll ignore us until we’re old enough to cause trouble—about
                        ten or eleven
                        years old, but after that, most demigods either make their way here, or they get killed off. A
                        few manage to
                        survive in the outside world and become famous. Believe me, if I told you the names, you’d know
                        them. Some don’t
                        even realize they’re demigods. But very, very few are like that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So monsters can’t get in here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shook her head. “Not unless they’re intentionally stocked in the woods
                        or specially
                        summoned by somebody on the inside.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why would anybody want to summon a monster?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Practice fights. Practical jokes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Practical jokes?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The point is, the borders are sealed to keep mortals and monsters out. From
                        the outside,
                        mortals look into the valley and see nothing unusual, just a strawberry farm.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So…you’re a year-rounder?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth nodded. From under the collar of her T-shirt she pulled a leather
                        necklace with five
                        clay beads of different colors. It was just like Luke’s, except Annabeth’s also had a big gold
                        ring strung on
                        it, like a college ring. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve been here since I was seven,” she said. “Every August, on the last day of
                        summer session,
                        you get a bead for surviving another year. I’ve been here longer than most of the counselors,
                        and they’re all in
                        college.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why did you come so young?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She twisted the ring on her necklace. “None of your business.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh.” I stood there for a minute in uncomfortable silence. “So…I could just
                        walk out of here
                        right now if I wanted to?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It would be suicide, but you could, with Mr. D’s or Chiron’s permission. But
                        they wouldn’t
                        give permission until the end of the summer session unless…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Unless?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You were granted a quest. But that hardly ever happens. The last time…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her voice trailed off. I could tell from her tone that the last time hadn’t
                        gone well. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Back in the sick room,” I said, “when you were feeding me that stuff—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ambrosia.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah. You asked me something about the summer solstice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s shoulders tensed. “So you <em class="calibre5">do </em>know
                        something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well…no. Back at my old school, I overheard Grover and Chiron talking about
                        it. Grover
                        mentioned the summer solstice. He said something like we didn’t have much time, because of the
                        deadline. What
                        did that mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She clenched her fists. “I wish I knew. Chiron and the satyrs, they know, but
                        they won’t tell
                        me. Something is wrong in Olympus, something pretty major. Last time I was there, everything
                        seemed so <em class="calibre5">normal</em>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve been to Olympus?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Some of us year-rounders—Luke and Clarisse and I and a few others—we took a
                        field trip during
                        winter solstice. That’s when the gods have their big annual council.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But…how did you get there?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Long Island Railroad, of course. You get off at Penn Station. Empire State
                        Building,
                        special elevator to the six hundredth floor.” She looked at me like she was sure I must know
                        this already. “You
                        <em class="calibre5">are </em>a New Yorker, right?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, sure.” As far as I knew, there were only a hundred and two floors in the
                        Empire State
                        Building, but I decided not to point that out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Right after we visited,” Annabeth continued, “the weather got weird, as if the
                        gods had
                        started fighting. A couple of times since, I’ve overheard satyrs talking. The best I can figure
                        out is that
                        something important was stolen. And if it isn’t returned by summer solstice, there’s going to be
                        trouble. When
                        you came, I was hoping…I mean—Athena can get along with just about anybody, except for Ares. And
                        of course she’s
                        got the rivalry with Poseidon. But, I mean, aside from that, I thought we could work together. I
                        thought you
                        might know something.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shook my head. I wished I could help her, but I felt too hungry and tired and
                        mentally
                        overloaded to ask any more questions. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve got to get a quest,” Annabeth muttered to herself. “I’m <em
                            class="calibre5">not
                        </em>too
                        young. If they would just tell me the problem…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I could smell barbecue smoke coming from somewhere nearby. Annabeth must’ve
                        heard my stomach
                        growl. She told me to go on, she’d catch me later. I left her on the pier, tracing her finger
                        across the rail as
                        if drawing a battle plan. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Back at cabin eleven, everybody was talking and horsing around, waiting for
                        dinner. For the
                        first time, I noticed that a lot of the campers had similar features: sharp noses, upturned
                        eyebrows,
                        mischievous smiles. They were the kind of kids that teachers would peg as troublemakers.
                        Thankfully, nobody paid
                        much attention to me as I walked over to my spot on the floor and plopped down with my minotaur
                        horn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The counselor, Luke, came over. He had the Hermes family resemblance, too. It
                        was marred by
                        that scar on his right cheek, but his smile was intact. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Found you a sleeping bag,” he said. “And here, I stole you some toiletries
                        from the camp
                        store.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/7-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t tell if he was kidding about the stealing part. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “Thanks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No prob.” Luke sat next to me, pushed his back against the wall. “Tough first
                        day?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t belong here,” I said. “I don’t even believe in gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” he said. “That’s how we all started. Once you start believing in them?
                        It doesn’t get
                        any easier.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bitterness in his voice surprised me, because Luke seemed like a pretty
                        easygoing guy. He
                        looked like he could handle just about anything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So your dad is Hermes?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pulled a switchblade out of his back pocket, and for a second I thought he
                        was going to gut
                        me, but he just scraped the mud off the sole of his sandal. “Yeah. Hermes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The wing-footed messenger guy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s him. Messengers. Medicine. Travelers, merchants, thieves. Anybody who
                        uses the roads.
                        That’s why you’re here, enjoying cabin eleven’s hospitality. Hermes isn’t picky about who he
                        sponsors.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I figured Luke didn’t mean to call me a nobody. He just had a lot on his mind.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You ever meet your dad?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Once.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I waited, thinking that if he wanted to tell me, he’d tell me. Apparently, he
                        didn’t. I
                        wondered if the story had anything to do with how he got his scar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke looked up and managed a smile. “Don’t worry about it, Percy. The campers
                        here, they’re
                        mostly good people. After all, we’re extended family, right? We take care of each other.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He seemed to understand how lost I felt, and I was grateful for that, because
                        an older guy like
                        him—even if he was a counselor—should’ve steered clear of an uncool middle-schooler like me. But
                        Luke had
                        welcomed me into the cabin. He’d even stolen me some toiletries, which was the nicest thing
                        anybody had done for
                        me all day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I decided to ask him my last big question, the one that had been bothering me
                        all afternoon.
                        “Clarisse, from Ares, was joking about me being ‘Big Three’ material. Then Annabeth…twice, she
                        said I might be
                        ‘the one.’ She said I should talk to the Oracle. What was that all about?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke folded his knife. “I hate prophecies.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His face twitched around the scar. “Let’s just say I messed things up for
                        everybody else. The
                        last two years, ever since my trip to the Garden of the Hesperides went sour, Chiron hasn’t
                        allowed any more
                        quests. Annabeth’s been dying to get out into the world. She pestered Chiron so much he finally
                        told her he
                        already knew her fate. He’d had a prophecy from the Oracle. He wouldn’t tell her the whole
                        thing, but he said
                        Annabeth wasn’t destined to go on a quest yet. She had to wait until…somebody special came to
                        the camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Somebody special?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t worry about it, kid,” Luke said. “Annabeth wants to think every new
                        camper who comes
                        through here is the omen she’s been waiting for. Now, come on, it’s dinnertime.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The moment he said it, a horn blew in the distance. Somehow, I knew it was a
                        conch shell, even
                        though I’d never heard one before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke yelled, “Eleven, fall in!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The whole cabin, about twenty of us, filed into the commons yard. We lined up
                        in order of
                        seniority, so of course I was dead last. Campers came from the other cabins, too, except for the
                        three empty
                        cabins at the end, and cabin eight, which had looked normal in the daytime, but was now starting
                        to glow silver
                        as the sun went down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We marched up the hill to the mess hall pavilion. Satyrs joined us from the
                        meadow. Naiads
                        emerged from the canoeing lake. A few other girls came out of the woods—and when I say out of
                        the woods, I mean
                        <em class="calibre5">straight </em>out of the woods. I saw one girl, about nine or ten years
                        old, melt from the
                        side of a maple tree and come skipping up the hill.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In all, there were maybe a hundred campers, a few dozen satyrs, and a dozen
                        assorted wood
                        nymphs and naiads. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the pavilion, torches blazed around the marble columns. A central fire
                        burned in a bronze
                        brazier the size of a bathtub. Each cabin had its own table, covered in white cloth trimmed in
                        purple. Four of
                        the tables were empty, but cabin eleven’s was way overcrowded. I had to squeeze on to the edge
                        of a bench with
                        half my butt hanging off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I saw Grover sitting at table twelve with Mr. D, a few satyrs, and a couple of
                        plump blond boys
                        who looked just like Mr. D. Chiron stood to one side, the picnic table being way too small for a
                        centaur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth sat at table six with a bunch of serious-looking athletic kids, all
                        with her gray eyes
                        and honey-blond hair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse sat behind me at Ares’s table. She’d apparently gotten over being
                        hosed down, because
                        she was laughing and belching right alongside her friends. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, Chiron pounded his hoof against the marble floor of the pavilion, and
                        everybody fell
                        silent. He raised a glass. “To the gods!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Everybody else raised their glasses. “To the gods!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Wood nymphs came forward with platters of food: grapes, apples, strawberries,
                        cheese, fresh
                        bread, and yes, barbecue! My glass was empty, but Luke said, “Speak to it. Whatever you
                        want—nonalcoholic, of
                        course.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “Cherry Coke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The glass filled with sparkling caramel liquid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I had an idea. “<em class="calibre5">Blue </em>Cherry Coke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The soda turned a violent shade of cobalt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took a cautious sip. Perfect. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I drank a toast to my mother. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She’s not gone, I told myself. Not permanently, anyway. She’s in the
                        Underworld. And if that’s
                        a real place, then someday…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Here you go, Percy,” Luke said, handing me a platter of smoked brisket. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I loaded my plate and was about to take a big bite when I noticed everybody
                        getting up,
                        carrying their plates toward the fire in the center of the pavilion. I wondered if they were
                        going for dessert
                        or something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on,” Luke told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As I got closer, I saw that everyone was taking a portion of their meal and
                        dropping it into
                        the fire, the ripest strawberry, the juiciest slice of beef, the warmest, most buttery roll.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke murmured in my ear, “Burnt offerings for the gods. They like the smell.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re kidding.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His look warned me not to take this lightly, but I couldn’t help wondering why
                        an immortal,
                        all-powerful being would like the smell of burning food. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke approached the fire, bowed his head, and tossed in a cluster of fat red
                        grapes. “Hermes.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was next. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wished I knew what god’s name to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, I made a silent plea. <em class="calibre5">Whoever you are, tell me.
                            Please. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I scraped a big slice of brisket into the flames. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When I caught a whiff of the smoke, I didn’t gag. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It smelled nothing like burning food. It smelled of hot chocolate and
                        fresh-baked brownies,
                        hamburgers on the grill and wildflowers, and a hundred other good things that shouldn’t have
                        gone well together,
                        but did. I could almost believe the gods could live off that smoke. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When everybody had returned to their seats and finished eating their meals,
                        Chiron pounded his
                        hoof again for our attention. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mr. D got up with a huge sigh. “Yes, I suppose I’d better say hello to all you
                        brats. Well,
                        hello. Our activities director, Chiron, says the next capture the flag is Friday. Cabin five
                        presently holds the
                        laurels.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A bunch of ugly cheering rose from the Ares table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Personally,” Mr. D continued, “I couldn’t care less, but congratulations.
                        Also, I should tell
                        you that we have a new camper today. Peter Johnson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron murmured something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Er, Percy Jackson,” Mr. D corrected. “That’s right. Hurrah, and all that. Now
                        run along to
                        your silly campfire. Go on.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Everybody cheered. We all headed down toward the amphitheater, where Apollo’s
                        cabin led a
                        sing-along. We sang camp songs about the gods and ate s’mores and joked around, and the funny
                        thing was, I
                        didn’t feel that anyone was staring at me anymore. I felt that I was home. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/7-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Later in the evening, when the sparks from the campfire were curling into a
                        starry sky, the
                        conch horn blew again, and we all filed back to our cabins. I didn’t realize how exhausted I was
                        until I
                        collapsed on my borrowed sleeping bag. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My fingers curled around the Minotaur’s horn. I thought about my mom, but I had
                        good thoughts:
                        her smile, the bedtime stories she would read me when I was a kid, the way she would tell me not
                        to let the
                        bedbugs bite. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When I closed my eyes, I fell asleep instantly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That was my first day at Camp Half-Blood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wish I’d known how briefly I would get to enjoy my new home. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">T</span>he next few days I settled into a routine that
                        felt almost normal,
                        if you don’t count the fact that I was getting lessons from satyrs, nymphs, and a centaur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Each morning I took Ancient Greek from Annabeth, and we talked about the gods
                        and goddesses in
                        the present tense, which was kind of weird. I discovered Annabeth was right about my dyslexia:
                        Ancient Greek
                        wasn’t that hard for me to read. At least, no harder than English. After a couple of mornings, I
                        could stumble
                        through a few lines of Homer without too much headache. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The rest of the day, I’d rotate through outdoor activities, looking for
                        something I was good
                        at. Chiron tried to teach me archery, but we found out pretty quick I wasn’t any good with a bow
                        and arrow. He
                        didn’t complain, even when he had to desnag a stray arrow out of his tail. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Foot racing? No good either. The wood-nymph instructors left me in the dust.
                        They told me not
                        to worry about it. They’d had centuries of practice running away from lovesick gods. But still,
                        it was a little
                        humiliating to be slower than a tree. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And wrestling? Forget it. Every time I got on the mat, Clarisse would pulverize
                        me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There’s more where that came from, punk,” she’d mumble in my ear. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The only thing I really excelled at was canoeing, and that wasn’t the kind of
                        heroic skill
                        people expected to see from the kid who had beaten the Minotaur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew the senior campers and counselors were watching me, trying to decide who
                        my dad was, but
                        they weren’t having an easy time of it. I wasn’t as strong as the Ares kids, or as good at
                        archery as the Apollo
                        kids. I didn’t have Hephaestus’s skill with metalwork or—gods forbid—Dionysus’s way with vine
                        plants. Luke told
                        me I might be a child of Hermes, a kind of jack-of-all-trades, master of none. But I got the
                        feeling he was just
                        trying to make me feel better. He really didn’t know what to make of me either. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Despite all that, I liked camp. I got used to the morning fog over the beach,
                        the smell of hot
                        strawberry fields in the afternoon, even the weird noises of monsters in the woods at night. I
                        would eat dinner
                        with cabin eleven, scrape part of my meal into the fire, and try to feel some connection to my
                        real dad. Nothing
                        came. Just that warm feeling I’d always had, like the memory of his smile. I tried not to think
                        too much about
                        my mom, but I kept wondering: if gods and monsters were real, if all this magical stuff was
                        possible, surely
                        there was some way to save her, to bring her back.…</p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I started to understand Luke’s bitterness and how he seemed to resent his
                        father, Hermes. So
                        okay, maybe gods had important things to do. But couldn’t they call once in a while, or thunder,
                        or something?
                        Dionysus could make Diet Coke appear out of thin air. Why couldn’t my dad, whoever he was, make
                        a phone appear?
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Thursday afternoon, three days after I’d arrived at Camp Half-Blood, I had my
                        first
                        sword-fighting lesson. Everybody from cabin eleven gathered in the big circular arena, where
                        Luke would be our
                        instructor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We started with basic stabbing and slashing, using some straw-stuffed dummies
                        in Greek armor. I
                        guess I did okay. At least, I understood what I was supposed to do and my reflexes were good.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The problem was, I couldn’t find a blade that felt right in my hands. Either
                        they were too
                        heavy, or too light, or too long. Luke tried his best to fix me up, but he agreed that none of
                        the practice
                        blades seemed to work for me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We moved on to dueling in pairs. Luke announced he would be my partner, since
                        this was my first
                        time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good luck,” one of the campers told me. “Luke’s the best swordsman in the last
                        three hundred
                        years.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe he’ll go easy on me,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The camper snorted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke showed me thrusts and parries and shield blocks the hard way. With every
                        swipe, I got a
                        little more battered and bruised. “Keep your guard up, Percy,” he’d say, then whap me in the
                        ribs with the flat
                        of his blade. “No, not that far up!” <em class="calibre5">Whap! </em>“Lunge!” <em
                            class="calibre5">Whap!
                        </em>“Now, back!” <em class="calibre5">Whap! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">By the time he called a break, I was soaked in sweat. Everybody swarmed the
                        drinks cooler. Luke
                        poured ice water on his head, which looked like such a good idea, I did the same. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Instantly, I felt better. Strength surged back into my arms. The sword didn’t
                        feel so awkward.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay, everybody circle up!” Luke ordered. “If Percy doesn’t mind, I want to
                        give you a little
                        demo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Great, I thought. Let’s all watch Percy get pounded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Hermes guys gathered around. They were suppressing smiles. I figured they’d
                        been in my
                        shoes before and couldn’t wait to see how Luke used me for a punching bag. He told everybody he
                        was going to
                        demonstrate a disarming technique: how to twist the enemy’s blade with the flat of your own
                        sword so that he had
                        no choice but to drop his weapon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is difficult,” he stressed. “I’ve had it used against me. No laughing at
                        Percy, now. Most
                        swordsmen have to work years to master this technique.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He demonstrated the move on me in slow motion. Sure enough, the sword clattered
                        out of my hand.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now in real time,” he said, after I’d retrieved my weapon. “We keep sparring
                        until one of us
                        pulls it off. Ready, Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded, and Luke came after me. Somehow, I kept him from getting a shot at
                        the hilt of my
                        sword. My senses opened up. I saw his attacks coming. I countered. I stepped forward and tried a
                        thrust of my
                        own. Luke deflected it easily, but I saw a change in his face. His eyes narrowed, and he started
                        to press me
                        with more force. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The sword grew heavy in my hand. The balance wasn’t right. I knew it was only a
                        matter of
                        seconds before Luke took me down, so I figured, What the heck? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried the disarming maneuver. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My blade hit the base of Luke’s and I twisted, putting my whole weight into a
                        downward thrust.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Clang.</em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke’s sword rattled against the stones. The tip of my blade was an inch from
                        his undefended
                        chest. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                    <p class="calibre14">The other campers were silent. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I lowered my sword. “Um, sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a moment, Luke was too stunned to speak. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sorry?” His scarred face broke into a grin. “By the gods, Percy, why are you
                        sorry? Show me
                        that again!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t want to. The short burst of manic energy had completely abandoned me.
                        But Luke
                        insisted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">This time, there was no contest. The moment our swords connected, Luke hit my
                        hilt and sent my
                        weapon skidding across the floor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After a long pause, somebody in the audience said, “Beginner’s luck?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Luke wiped the sweat off his brow. He appraised me with an entirely new
                        interest. “Maybe,” he
                        said. “But I wonder what Percy could do with a balanced sword.…” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Friday afternoon, I was sitting with Grover at the lake, resting from a
                        near-death experience
                        on the climbing wall. Grover had scampered to the top like a mountain goat, but the lava had
                        almost gotten me.
                        My shirt had smoking holes in it. The hairs had been singed off my forearms. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We sat on the pier, watching the naiads do underwater basket-weaving, until I
                        got up the nerve
                        to ask Grover how his conversation had gone with Mr. D. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His face turned a sickly shade of yellow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fine,” he said. “Just great.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So your career’s still on track?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He glanced at me nervously. “Chiron t-told you I want a searcher’s license?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well…no.” I had no idea what a searcher’s license was, but it didn’t seem like
                        the right time
                        to ask. “He just said you had big plans, you know…and that you needed credit for completing a
                        keeper’s
                        assignment. So did you get it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover looked down at the naiads. “Mr. D suspended judgment. He said I hadn’t
                        failed or
                        succeeded with you yet, so our fates were still tied together. If you got a quest and I went
                        along to protect
                        you, and we both came back alive, then maybe he’d consider the job complete.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My spirits lifted. “Well, that’s not so bad, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">Blaa-ha-ha! </em>He might as well have transferred me to
                        stable-cleaning
                        duty. The chances of you getting a quest…and even if you did, why would you want <em
                            class="calibre5">me
                        </em>along?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Of course I’d want you along!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover stared glumly into the water. “Basket-weaving…Must be nice to have a
                        useful skill.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to reassure him that he had lots of talents, but that just made him
                        look more
                        miserable. We talked about canoeing and swordplay for a while, then debated the pros and cons of
                        the different
                        gods. Finally, I asked him about the four empty cabins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Number eight, the silver one, belongs to Artemis,” he said. “She vowed to be a
                        maiden forever.
                        So of course, no kids. The cabin is, you know, honorary. If she didn’t have one, she’d be mad.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, okay. But the other three, the ones at the end. Are those the Big
                        Three?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover tensed. We were getting close to a touchy subject. “No. One of them,
                        number two, is
                        Hera’s,” he said. “That’s another honorary thing. She’s the goddess of marriage, so of course
                        she wouldn’t go
                        around having affairs with mortals. That’s her husband’s job. When we say the Big Three, we mean
                        the three
                        powerful brothers, the sons of Kronos.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Zeus, Poseidon, Hades.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Right. You know. After the great battle with the Titans, they took over the
                        world from their
                        dad and drew lots to decide who got what.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Zeus got the sky,” I remembered. “Poseidon the sea, Hades the Underworld.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh-huh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But Hades doesn’t have a cabin here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. He doesn’t have a throne on Olympus, either. He sort of does his own thing
                        down in the
                        Underworld. If he did have a cabin here…” Grover shuddered. “Well, it wouldn’t be pleasant.
                        Let’s leave it at
                        that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But Zeus and Poseidon—they both had, like, a bazillion kids in the myths. Why
                        are their cabins
                        empty?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shifted his hooves uncomfortably. “About sixty years ago, after World
                        War II, the Big
                        Three agreed they wouldn’t sire any more heroes. Their children were just too powerful. They
                        were affecting the
                        course of human events too much, causing too much carnage. World War II, you know, that was
                        basically a fight
                        between the sons of Zeus and Poseidon on one side, and the sons of Hades on the other. The
                        winning side, Zeus
                        and Poseidon, made Hades swear an oath with them: no more affairs with mortal women. They all
                        swore on the River
                        Styx.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder boomed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “That’s the most serious oath you can make.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And the brothers kept their word—no kids?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover’s face darkened. “Seventeen years ago, Zeus fell off the wagon. There
                        was this TV
                        starlet with a big fluffy eighties hairdo—he just couldn’t help himself. When their child was
                        born, a little
                        girl named Thalia…well, the River Styx is serious about promises. Zeus himself got off easy
                        because he’s
                        immortal, but he brought a terrible fate on his daughter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But that isn’t fair! It wasn’t the little girl’s fault.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover hesitated. “Percy, children of the Big Three have powers greater than
                        other half-bloods.
                        They have a strong aura, a scent that attracts monsters. When Hades found out about the girl, he
                        wasn’t too
                        happy about Zeus breaking his oath. Hades let the worst monsters out of Tartarus to torment
                        Thalia. A satyr was
                        assigned to be her keeper when she was twelve, but there was nothing he could do. He tried to
                        escort her here
                        with a couple of other half-bloods she’d befriended. They almost made it. They got all the way
                        to the top of
                        that hill.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pointed across the valley, to the pine tree where I’d fought the minotaur.
                        “All three Kindly
                        Ones were after them, along with a hoard of hellhounds. They were about to be overrun when
                        Thalia told her satyr
                        to take the other two half-bloods to safety while she held off the monsters. She was wounded and
                        tired, and she
                        didn’t want to live like a hunted animal. The satyr didn’t want to leave her, but he couldn’t
                        change her mind,
                        and he had to protect the others. So Thalia made her final stand alone, at the top of that hill.
                        As she died,
                        Zeus took pity on her. He turned her into that pine tree. Her spirit still helps protect the
                        borders of the
                        valley. That’s why the hill is called Half-Blood Hill.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the pine in the distance. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/8-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The story made me feel hollow, and guilty too. A girl my age had sacrificed
                        herself to save her
                        friends. She had faced a whole army of monsters. Next to that, my victory over the Minotaur
                        didn’t seem like
                        much. I wondered, if I’d acted differently, could I have saved my mother? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover,” I said, “have heroes really gone on quests to the Underworld?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sometimes,” he said. “Orpheus. Hercules. Houdini.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And have they ever returned somebody from the dead?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. Never. Orpheus came close.…Percy, you’re not seriously thinking—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I lied. “I was just wondering. So…a satyr is always assigned to guard a
                        demigod?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover studied me warily. I hadn’t persuaded him that I’d really dropped the
                        Underworld idea.
                        “Not always. We go undercover to a lot of schools. We try to sniff out the half-bloods who have
                        the makings of
                        great heroes. If we find one with a very strong aura, like a child of the Big Three, we alert
                        Chiron. He tries
                        to keep an eye on them, since they could cause really huge problems.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And you found me. Chiron said you thought I might be something special.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover looked as if I’d just led him into a trap. “I didn’t…Oh, listen, don’t
                        think like that.
                        If you <em class="calibre5">were</em>—you know—you’d never <em class="calibre5">ever </em>be
                        allowed a quest,
                        and I’d never get my license. You’re probably a child of Hermes. Or maybe even one of the minor
                        gods, like
                        Nemesis, the god of revenge. Don’t worry, okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I got the idea he was reassuring himself more than me. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">That night after dinner, there was a lot more excitement than usual. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At last, it was time for capture the flag. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When the plates were cleared away, the conch horn sounded and we all stood at
                        our tables. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Campers yelled and cheered as Annabeth and two of her siblings ran into the
                        pavilion carrying a
                        silk banner. It was about ten feet long, glistening gray, with a painting of a barn owl above an
                        olive tree.
                        From the opposite side of the pavilion, Clarisse and her buddies ran in with another banner, of
                        identical size,
                        but gaudy red, painted with a bloody spear and a boar’s head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned to Luke and yelled over the noise, “Those are the flags?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ares and Athena always lead the teams?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not always,” he said. “But often.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So, if another cabin captures one, what do you do—repaint the flag?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He grinned. “You’ll see. First we have to get one.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whose side are we on?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gave me a sly look, as if he knew something I didn’t. The scar on his face
                        made him look
                        almost evil in the torchlight. “We’ve made a temporary alliance with Athena. Tonight, we get the
                        flag from Ares.
                        And <em class="calibre5">you </em>are going to help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The teams were announced. Athena had made an alliance with Apollo and Hermes,
                        the two biggest
                        cabins. Apparently, privileges had been traded—shower times, chore schedules, the best slots for
                        activities—in
                        order to win support. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares had allied themselves with everybody else: Dionysus, Demeter, Aphrodite,
                        and Hephaestus.
                        From what I’d seen, Dionysus’s kids were actually good athletes, but there were only two of
                        them. Demeter’s kids
                        had the edge with nature skills and outdoor stuff, but they weren’t very aggressive. Aphrodite’s
                        sons and
                        daughters I wasn’t too worried about. They mostly sat out every activity and checked their
                        reflections in the
                        lake and did their hair and gossiped. Hephaestus’s kids weren’t pretty, and there were only four
                        of them, but
                        they were big and burly from working in the metal shop all day. They might be a problem. That,
                        of course, left
                        Ares’s cabin: a dozen of the biggest, ugliest, meanest kids on Long Island, or anywhere else on
                        the planet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron hammered his hoof on the marble. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Heroes!” he announced. “You know the rules. The creek is the boundary line.
                        The entire forest
                        is fair game. All magic items are allowed. The banner must be prominently displayed, and have no
                        more than two
                        guards. Prisoners may be disarmed, but may not be bound or gagged. No killing or maiming is
                        allowed. I will
                        serve as referee and battlefield medic. Arm yourselves!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He spread his hands, and the tables were suddenly covered with equipment:
                        helmets, bronze
                        swords, spears, oxhide shields coated in metal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa,” I said. “We’re really supposed to use these?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke looked at me as if I were crazy. “Unless you want to get skewered by your
                        friends in cabin
                        five. Here—Chiron thought these would fit. You’ll be on border patrol.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My shield was the size of an NBA backboard, with a big caduceus in the middle.
                        It weighed about
                        a million pounds. I could have snowboarded on it fine, but I hoped nobody seriously expected me
                        to run fast. My
                        helmet, like all the helmets on Athena’s side, had a blue horsehair plume on top. Ares and their
                        allies had red
                        plumes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth yelled, “Blue team, forward!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We cheered and shook our swords and followed her down the path to the south
                        woods. The red team
                        yelled taunts at us as they headed off toward the north. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed to catch up with Annabeth without tripping over my equipment. “Hey.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She kept marching. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So what’s the plan?” I asked. “Got any magic items you can loan me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her hand drifted toward her pocket, as if she were afraid I’d stolen something.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just watch Clarisse’s spear,” she said. “You don’t want that thing touching
                        you. Otherwise,
                        don’t worry. We’ll take the banner from Ares. Has Luke given you your job?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Border patrol, whatever that means.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s easy. Stand by the creek, keep the reds away. Leave the rest to me.
                        Athena always has a
                        plan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pushed ahead, leaving me in the dust. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay,” I mumbled. “Glad you wanted me on your team.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was a warm, sticky night. The woods were dark, with fireflies popping in and
                        out of view.
                        Annabeth stationed me next to a little creek that gurgled over some rocks, then she and the rest
                        of the team
                        scattered into the trees. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Standing there alone, with my big blue-feathered helmet and my huge shield, I
                        felt like an
                        idiot. The bronze sword, like all the swords I’d tried so far, seemed balanced wrong. The
                        leather grip pulled on
                        my hand like a bowling ball. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was no way anybody would actually attack me, would they? I mean, Olympus
                        had to have
                        liability issues, right? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Far away, the conch horn blew. I heard whoops and yells in the woods, the
                        clanking of metal,
                        kids fighting. A blue-plumed ally from Apollo raced past me like a deer, leaped through the
                        creek, and
                        disappeared into enemy territory. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Great, I thought. I’ll miss all the fun, as usual. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I heard a sound that sent a chill up my spine, a low canine growl,
                        somewhere close by.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I raised my shield instinctively; I had the feeling something was stalking me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then the growling stopped. I felt the presence retreating. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">On the other side of the creek, the underbrush exploded. Five Ares warriors
                        came yelling and
                        screaming out of the dark. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cream the punk!” Clarisse screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her ugly pig eyes glared through the slits of her helmet. She brandished a
                        five-foot-long
                        spear, its barbed metal tip flickering with red light. Her siblings had only the standard-issue
                        bronze
                        swords—not that that made me feel any better. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They charged across the stream. There was no help in sight. I could run. Or I
                        could defend
                        myself against half the Ares cabin. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed to sidestep the first kid’s swing, but these guys were not as stupid
                        as the Minotaur.
                        They surrounded me, and Clarisse thrust at me with her spear. My shield deflected the point, but
                        I felt a
                        painful tingling all over my body. My hair stood on end. My shield arm went numb, and the air
                        burned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Electricity. Her stupid spear was electric. I fell back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Another Ares guy slammed me in the chest with the butt of his sword and I hit
                        the dirt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They could’ve kicked me into jelly, but they were too busy laughing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Give him a haircut,” Clarisse said. “Grab his hair.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed to get to my feet. I raised my sword, but Clarisse slammed it aside
                        with her spear as
                        sparks flew. Now both my arms felt numb. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, wow,” Clarisse said. “I’m scared of this guy. Really scared.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The flag is that way,” I told her. I wanted to sound angry, but I was afraid
                        it didn’t come
                        out that way. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” one of her siblings said. “But see, we don’t care about the flag. We
                        care about a guy
                        who made our cabin look stupid.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You do that without my help,” I told them. It probably wasn’t the smartest
                        thing to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Two of them came at me. I backed up toward the creek, tried to raise my shield,
                        but Clarisse
                        was too fast. Her spear stuck me straight in the ribs. If I hadn’t been wearing an armored
                        breastplate, I
                        would’ve been shish-ke-babbed. As it was, the electric point just about shocked my teeth out of
                        my mouth. One of
                        her cabinmates slashed his sword across my arm, leaving a good-size cut. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Seeing my own blood made me dizzy—warm and cold at the same time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No maiming,” I managed to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oops,” the guy said. “Guess I lost my dessert privilege.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pushed me into the creek and I landed with a splash. They all laughed. I
                        figured as soon as
                        they were through being amused, I would die. But then something happened. The water seemed to
                        wake up my senses,
                        as if I’d just had a bag of my mom’s double-espresso jelly beans. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse and her cabinmates came into the creek to get me, but I stood to meet
                        them. I knew
                        what to do. I swung the flat of my sword against the first guy’s head and knocked his helmet
                        clean off. I hit
                        him so hard I could see his eyes vibrating as he crumpled into the water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ugly Number Two and Ugly Number Three came at me. I slammed one in the face
                        with my shield and
                        used my sword to shear off the other guy’s horsehair plume. Both of them backed up quick. Ugly
                        Number Four
                        didn’t look really anxious to attack, but Clarisse kept coming, the point of her spear crackling
                        with energy. As
                        soon as she thrust, I caught the shaft between the edge of my shield and my sword, and I snapped
                        it like a twig.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah!” she screamed. “You idiot! You corpse-breath worm!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She probably would’ve said worse, but I smacked her between the eyes with my
                        sword-butt and
                        sent her stumbling backward out of the creek. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I heard yelling, elated screams, and I saw Luke racing toward the boundary
                        line with the
                        red team’s banner lifted high. He was flanked by a couple of Hermes guys covering his retreat,
                        and a few Apollos
                        behind them, fighting off the Hephaestus kids. The Ares folks got up, and Clarisse muttered a
                        dazed curse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A trick!” she shouted. “It was a trick.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They staggered after Luke, but it was too late. Everybody converged on the
                        creek as Luke ran
                        across into friendly territory. Our side exploded into cheers. The red banner shimmered and
                        turned to silver.
                        The boar and spear were replaced with a huge caduceus, the symbol of cabin eleven. Everybody on
                        the blue team
                        picked up Luke and started carrying him around on their shoulders. Chiron cantered out from the
                        woods and blew
                        the conch horn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The game was over. We’d won. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to join the celebration when Annabeth’s voice, right next to me in
                        the creek, said,
                        “Not bad, hero.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked, but she wasn’t there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where the heck did you learn to fight like that?” she asked. The air
                        shimmered, and she
                        materialized, holding a Yankees baseball cap as if she’d just taken it off her head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt myself getting angry. I wasn’t even fazed by the fact that she’d just
                        been invisible.
                        “You set me up,” I said. “You put me here because you knew Clarisse would come after me, while
                        you sent Luke
                        around the flank. You had it all figured out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shrugged. “I told you. Athena always, always has a plan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A plan to get me pulverized.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I came as fast as I could. I was about to jump in, but…” She shrugged. “You
                        didn’t need help.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then she noticed my wounded arm. “How did you do that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sword cut,” I said. “What do you think?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. It <em class="calibre5">was </em>a sword cut. Look at it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The blood was gone. Where the huge cut had been, there was a long white
                        scratch, and even that
                        was fading. As I watched, it turned into a small scar, and disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I don’t get it,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth was thinking hard. I could almost see the gears turning. She looked
                        down at my feet,
                        then at Clarisse’s broken spear, and said, “Step out of the water, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just do it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I came out of the creek and immediately felt bone tired. My arms started to go
                        numb again. My
                        adrenaline rush left me. I almost fell over, but Annabeth steadied me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, Styx,” she cursed. “This is <em class="calibre5">not </em>good. I didn’t
                        want…I assumed it
                        would be Zeus.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I could ask what she meant, I heard that canine growl again, but much
                        closer than
                        before. A howl ripped through the forest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The campers’ cheering died instantly. Chiron shouted something in Ancient
                        Greek, which I would
                        realize, only later, I had understood perfectly: <em class="calibre5">“Stand ready! My bow!”
                        </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth drew her sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There on the rocks just above us was a black hound the size of a rhino, with
                        lava-red eyes and
                        fangs like daggers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was looking straight at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody moved except Annabeth, who yelled, “Percy, run!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She tried to step in front of me, but the hound was too fast. It leaped over
                        her—an enormous
                        shadow with teeth—and just as it hit me, as I stumbled backward and felt its razor-sharp claws
                        ripping through
                        my armor, there was a cascade of thwacking sounds, like forty pieces of paper being ripped one
                        after the other.
                        From the hound’s neck sprouted a cluster of arrows. The monster fell dead at my feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">By some miracle, I was still alive. I didn’t want to look underneath the ruins
                        of my shredded
                        armor. My chest felt warm and wet, and I knew I was badly cut. Another second, and the monster
                        would’ve turned
                        me into a hundred pounds of delicatessen meat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron trotted up next to us, a bow in his hand, his face grim. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“Di immortales!” </em>Annabeth said. “That’s a hellhound
                        from the Fields
                        of Punishment. They don’t…they’re not supposed to…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Someone summoned it,” Chiron said. “Someone inside the camp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke came over, the banner in his hand forgotten, his moment of glory gone.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Clarisse yelled, “It’s all Percy’s fault! Percy summoned it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Be quiet, child,” Chiron told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We watched the body of the hellhound melt into shadow, soaking into the ground
                        until it
                        disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re wounded,” Annabeth told me. “Quick, Percy, get in the water.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m okay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, you’re not,” she said. “Chiron, watch this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was too tired to argue. I stepped back into the creek, the whole camp
                        gathering around me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Instantly, I felt better. I could feel the cuts on my chest closing up. Some of
                        the campers
                        gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, I—I don’t know why,” I said, trying to apologize. “I’m sorry.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But they weren’t watching my wounds heal. They were staring at something above
                        my head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Annabeth said, pointing. “Um…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">By the time I looked up, the sign was already fading, but I could still make
                        out the hologram
                        of green light, spinning and gleaming. A three-tipped spear: a trident. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“Your father,” Annabeth murmured. “This is <em class="calibre5">really </em>not
                        good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It is determined,” Chiron announced. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All around me, campers started kneeling, even the Ares cabin, though they
                        didn’t look happy
                        about it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My father?” I asked, completely bewildered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Poseidon,” said Chiron. “Earthshaker, Stormbringer, Father of Horses. Hail,
                        Perseus Jackson,
                        Son of the Sea God.” </p>

                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t have to share with anybody. I had plenty of room for all my stuff: the
                        Minotaur’s
                        horn, one set of spare clothes, and a toiletry bag. I got to sit at my own dinner table, pick
                        all my own
                        activities, call “lights out” whenever I felt like it, and not listen to anybody else. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And I was absolutely miserable. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Just when I’d started to feel accepted, to feel I had a home in cabin eleven
                        and I might be a
                        normal kid—or as normal as you can be when you’re a half-blood—I’d been separated out as if I
                        had some rare
                        disease. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody mentioned the hellhound, but I got the feeling they were all talking
                        about it behind my
                        back. The attack had scared everybody. It sent two messages: one, that I was the son of the Sea
                        God; and two,
                        monsters would stop at nothing to kill me. They could even invade a camp that had always been
                        considered safe.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The other campers steered clear of me as much as possible. Cabin eleven was too
                        nervous to have
                        sword class with me after what I’d done to the Ares folks in the woods, so my lessons with Luke
                        became
                        one-on-one. He pushed me harder than ever, and wasn’t afraid to bruise me up in the process.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re going to need all the training you can get,” he promised, as we were
                        working with
                        swords and flaming torches. “Now let’s try that viper-beheading strike again. Fifty more
                        repetitions.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth still taught me Greek in the mornings, but she seemed distracted.
                        Every time I said
                        something, she scowled at me, as if I’d just poked her between the eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After lessons, she would walk away muttering to herself: “Quest…Poseidon?…Dirty
                        rotten…Got to
                        make a plan…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Even Clarisse kept her distance, though her venomous looks made it clear she
                        wanted to kill me
                        for breaking her magic spear. I wished she would just yell or punch me or something. I’d rather
                        get into fights
                        every day than be ignored. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre17">I knew somebody at camp resented me, because one night I came into my cabin and
                        found a mortal
                        newspaper dropped inside the doorway, a copy of the <em class="calibre5">New York Daily
                            News</em>, opened to the
                        Metro page. The article took me almost an hour to read, because the angrier I got, the more the
                        words floated
                        around on the page. </p>

                            mysterious
                            disappearance. The family’s badly burned ’78 Camaro was discovered last Saturday on a north
                            Long Island road
                            with the roof ripped off and the front axle broken. The car had flipped and skidded for

                            hastily, under
                            mysterious circumstances. Small traces of blood were found in the car and near the scene of
                            the wreck, but
                            there were no other signs of the missing Jacksons. Residents in the rural area reported
                            seeing nothing

                            Jackson, is a troubled
                            child who has been kicked out of numerous boarding schools and has expressed violent
                            tendencies in the past.

                        This time,
                        there was a city behind me. Not New York. The sprawl was different: buildings spread farther
                        apart, palm trees
                        and low hills in the distance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">About a hundred yards down the surf, two men were fighting. They looked like TV
                        wrestlers,
                        muscular, with beards and long hair. Both wore flowing Greek tunics, one trimmed in blue, the
                        other in green.
                        They grappled with each other, wrestled, kicked and head-butted, and every time they connected,
                        lightning
                        flashed, the sky grew darker, and the wind rose. </p>

                        blew me back,
                        until I was running in place, my heels digging uselessly in the sand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Over the roar of the storm, I could hear the blue-robed one yelling at the

                        fighting over a toy. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">I yelled, <em class="calibre5">Stop it! Stop fighting! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The ground shook. Laughter came from somewhere under the earth, and a voice so

                    <p class="calibre14">Nervously, I got dressed and followed, sure that I was in huge trouble. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For days, I’d been half expecting a summons to the Big House. Now that I was
                        declared a son of
                        Poseidon, one of the Big Three gods who weren’t supposed to have kids, I figured it was a crime
                        for me just to
                        be alive. The other gods had probably been debating the best way to punish me for existing, and
                        now Mr. D was
                        ready to deliver their verdict. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Over Long Island Sound, the sky looked like ink soup coming to a boil. A hazy
                        curtain of rain
                        was coming in our direction. I asked Grover if we needed an umbrella. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” he said. “It never rains here unless we want it to.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I pointed at the storm. “What the heck is that, then?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He glanced uneasily at the sky. “It’ll pass around us. Bad weather always
                        does.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I realized he was right. In the week I’d been here, it had never even been
                        overcast. The few
                        rain clouds I’d seen had skirted right around the edges of the valley. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But this storm…this one was huge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the volleyball pit, the kids from Apollo’s cabin were playing a morning game
                        against the
                        satyrs. Dionysus’s twins were walking around in the strawberry fields, making the plants grow.
                        Everybody was
                        going about their normal business, but they looked tense. They kept their eyes on the storm.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and I walked up to the front porch of the Big House. Dionysus sat at the
                        pinochle table
                        in his tiger-striped Hawaiian shirt with his Diet Coke, just as he had on my first day. Chiron
                        sat across the
                        table in his fake wheelchair. They were playing against invisible opponents—two sets of cards
                        hovering in the
                        air. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, well,” Mr. D said without looking up. “Our little celebrity.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I waited. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come closer,” Mr. D said. “And don’t expect me to kowtow to you, mortal, just
                        because old
                        Barnacle-Beard is your father.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A net of lightning flashed across the clouds. Thunder shook the windows of the
                        house. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Blah, blah, blah,” Dionysus said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron feigned interest in his pinochle cards. Grover cowered by the railing,
                        his hooves
                        clopping back and forth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If I had my way,” Dionysus said, “I would cause your molecules to erupt in
                        flames. We’d sweep
                        up the ashes and be done with a lot of trouble. But Chiron seems to feel this would be against
                        my mission at
                        this cursed camp: to keep you little brats safe from harm.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Spontaneous combustion <em class="calibre5">is </em>a form of harm, Mr. D,”
                        Chiron put in.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nonsense,” Dionysus said. “Boy wouldn’t feel a thing. Nevertheless, I’ve
                        agreed to restrain
                        myself. I’m thinking of turning you into a dolphin instead, sending you back to your father.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mr. D—” Chiron warned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, all right,” Dionysus relented. “There’s one more option. But it’s deadly
                        foolishness.”
                        Dionysus rose, and the invisible players’ cards dropped to the table. “I’m off to Olympus for
                        the emergency
                        meeting. If the boy is still here when I get back, I’ll turn him into an Atlantic bottlenose. Do
                        you understand?
                        And Perseus Jackson, if you’re at all smart, you’ll see that’s a much more sensible choice than
                        what Chiron
                        feels you must do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Dionysus picked up a playing card, twisted it, and it became a plastic
                        rectangle. A credit
                        card? No. A security pass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He snapped his fingers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The air seemed to fold and bend around him. He became a hologram, then a wind,
                        then he was
                        gone, leaving only the smell of fresh-pressed grapes lingering behind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron smiled at me, but he looked tired and strained. “Sit, Percy, please. And
                        Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We did. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron laid his cards on the table, a winning hand he hadn’t gotten to use.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tell me, Percy,” he said. “What did you make of the hellhound?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Just hearing the name made me shudder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron probably wanted me to say, <em class="calibre5">Heck, it was nothing. I
                            eat hellhounds
                            for breakfast. </em>But I didn’t feel like lying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It scared me,” I said. “If you hadn’t shot it, I’d be dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ll meet worse, Percy. Far worse, before you’re done.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Done…with what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your quest, of course. Will you accept it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I glanced at Grover, who was crossing his fingers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um, sir,” I said, “you haven’t told me what it is yet.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron grimaced. “Well, that’s the hard part, the details.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder rumbled across the valley. The storm clouds had now reached the edge of
                        the beach. As
                        far as I could see, the sky and the sea were boiling together. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Poseidon and Zeus,” I said. “They’re fighting over something
                        valuable…something that was
                        stolen, aren’t they?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron and Grover exchanged looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron sat forward in his wheelchair. “How did you know that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My face felt hot. I wished I hadn’t opened my big mouth. “The weather since
                        Christmas has been
                        weird, like the sea and the sky are fighting. Then I talked to Annabeth, and she’d overheard
                        something about a
                        theft. And…I’ve also been having these dreams.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I knew it,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hush, satyr,” Chiron ordered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But it is his quest!” Grover’s eyes were bright with excitement. “It must be!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Only the Oracle can determine.” Chiron stroked his bristly beard.
                        “Nevertheless, Percy, you
                        are correct. Your father and Zeus are having their worst quarrel in centuries. They are fighting
                        over something
                        valuable that was stolen. To be precise: a lightning bolt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I laughed nervously. “A <em class="calibre5">what</em>?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Do not take this lightly,” Chiron warned. “I’m not talking about some
                        tinfoil-covered zigzag
                        you’d see in a second-grade play. I’m talking about a two-foot-long cylinder of high-grade
                        celestial bronze,
                        capped on both ends with god-level explosives.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Zeus’s master bolt,” Chiron said, getting worked up now. “The symbol of his
                        power, from which
                        all other lightning bolts are patterned. The first weapon made by the Cyclopes for the war
                        against the Titans,
                        the bolt that sheared the top off Mount Etna and hurled Kronos from his throne; the master bolt,
                        which packs
                        enough power to make mortal hydrogen bombs look like firecrackers.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And it’s missing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stolen,” Chiron said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“By who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“By <em class="calibre5">whom</em>,” Chiron corrected. Once a teacher, always a
                        teacher. “By
                        you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mouth fell open. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“At least”—Chiron held up a hand—“that’s what Zeus thinks. During the winter
                        solstice, at the
                        last council of the gods, Zeus and Poseidon had an argument. The usual nonsense: ‘Mother Rhea
                        always liked you
                        best,’ ‘Air disasters are more spectacular than sea disasters,’ et cetera. Afterward, Zeus
                        realized his master
                        bolt was missing, taken from the throne room under his very nose. He immediately blamed
                        Poseidon. Now, a god
                        cannot usurp another god’s symbol of power directly—that is forbidden by the most ancient of
                        divine laws. But
                        Zeus believes your father convinced a human hero to take it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But I didn’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Patience and listen, child,” Chiron said. “Zeus has good reason to be
                        suspicious. The forges
                        of the Cyclopes are under the ocean, which gives Poseidon some influence over the makers of his
                        brother’s
                        lightning. Zeus believes Poseidon has taken the master bolt, and is now secretly having the
                        Cyclopes build an
                        arsenal of illegal copies, which might be used to topple Zeus from his throne. The only thing
                        Zeus wasn’t sure
                        about was which hero Poseidon used to steal the bolt. Now Poseidon has openly claimed you as his
                        son. You were
                        in New York over the winter holidays. You could easily have snuck into Olympus. Zeus believes he
                        has found his
                        thief.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But I’ve never even been to Olympus! Zeus is crazy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron and Grover glanced nervously at the sky. The clouds didn’t seem to be
                        parting around us,
                        as Grover had promised. They were rolling straight over our valley, sealing us in like a coffin
                        lid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Er, Percy…?” Grover said. “We don’t use the <em class="calibre5">c</em>-word
                        to describe the
                        Lord of the Sky.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Perhaps <em class="calibre5">paranoid</em>,” Chiron suggested. “Then again,
                        Poseidon has tried
                        to unseat Zeus before. I believe that was question thirty-eight on your final exam.…” He looked
                        at me as if he
                        actually expected me to remember question thirty-eight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">How could anyone accuse me of stealing a god’s weapon? I couldn’t even steal a
                        slice of pizza
                        from Gabe’s poker party without getting busted. Chiron was waiting for an answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Something about a golden net?” I guessed. “Poseidon and Hera and a few other
                        gods…they, like,
                        trapped Zeus and wouldn’t let him out until he promised to be a better ruler, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Correct,” Chiron said. “And Zeus has never trusted Poseidon since. Of course,
                        Poseidon denies
                        stealing the master bolt. He took great offense at the accusation. The two have been arguing
                        back and forth for
                        months, threatening war. And now, you’ve come along—the proverbial last straw.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But I’m just a kid!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Grover cut in, “if you were Zeus, and you already thought your brother
                        was plotting to
                        overthrow you, then your brother suddenly admitted he had broken the sacred oath he took after
                        World War II,
                        that he’s fathered a new mortal hero who might be used as a weapon against you.…Wouldn’t that
                        put a twist in
                        your toga?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But I didn’t do anything. Poseidon—my dad—he didn’t really have this master
                        bolt stolen, did
                        he?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron sighed. “Most thinking observers would agree that thievery is not
                        Poseidon’s style. But
                        the Sea God is too proud to try convincing Zeus of that. Zeus has demanded that Poseidon return
                        the bolt by the
                        summer solstice. That’s June twenty-first, ten days from now. Poseidon wants an apology for
                        being called a thief
                        by the same date. I hoped that diplomacy might prevail, that Hera or Demeter or Hestia would
                        make the two
                        brothers see sense. But your arrival has inflamed Zeus’s temper. Now neither god will back down.
                        Unless someone
                        intervenes, unless the master bolt is found and returned to Zeus before the solstice, there will
                        be war. And do
                        you know what a full-fledged war would look like, Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Bad?” I guessed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Imagine the world in chaos. Nature at war with itself. Olympians forced to
                        choose sides
                        between Zeus and Poseidon. Destruction. Carnage. Millions dead. Western civilization turned into
                        a battleground
                        so big it will make the Trojan War look like a water-balloon fight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Bad,” I repeated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And you, Percy Jackson, would be the first to feel Zeus’s wrath.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It started to rain. Volleyball players stopped their game and stared in stunned
                        silence at the
                        sky. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">I </em>had brought this storm to Half-Blood Hill. Zeus was
                        punishing the
                        whole camp because of me. I was furious. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So I have to find the stupid bolt,” I said. “And return it to Zeus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What better peace offering,” Chiron said, “than to have the son of Poseidon
                        return Zeus’s
                        property?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If Poseidon doesn’t have it, where is the thing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I believe I know.” Chiron’s expression was grim. “Part of a prophecy I had
                        years ago…well,
                        some of the lines make sense to me, now. But before I can say more, you must officially take up
                        the quest. You
                        must seek the counsel of the Oracle.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why can’t you tell me where the bolt is beforehand?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because if I did, you would be too afraid to accept the challenge.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I swallowed. “Good reason.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You agree then?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at Grover, who nodded encouragingly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Easy for him. I was the one Zeus wanted to kill. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All right,” I said. “It’s better than being turned into a dolphin.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">“Then it’s time you consulted the Oracle,” Chiron said. “Go upstairs, Percy
                        Jackson, to the
                        attic. When you come back down, assuming you’re still sane, we will talk more.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Four flights up, the stairs ended under a green trapdoor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I pulled the cord. The door swung down, and a wooden ladder clattered into
                        place. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The warm air from above smelled like mildew and rotten wood and something
                        else…a smell I
                        remembered from biology class. Reptiles. The smell of snakes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I held my breath and climbed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The attic was filled with Greek hero junk: armor stands covered in cobwebs;
                        once-bright shields
                        pitted with rust; old leather steamer trunks plastered with stickers saying <small
                            class="calibre4">ITHAKA</small>, <small class="calibre4">CIRCE’S ISLE</small>, and <small
                            class="calibre4">LAND OF THE AMAZONS</small>. One long table was stacked with glass jars
                        filled with pickled
                        <em class="calibre5">things</em>—severed hairy claws, huge yellow eyes, various other parts of
                        monsters. A dusty
                        mounted trophy on the wall looked like a giant snake’s head, but with horns and a full set of
                        shark’s teeth. The
                        plaque read, <small class="calibre4">HYDRA HEAD #1</small>, <small
                            class="calibre4">WOODSTOCK</small>, <small class="calibre4">N.Y.</small>, <small
                            class="calibre4">1969</small>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">By the window, sitting on a wooden tripod stool, was the most gruesome memento
                        of all: a mummy.
                        Not the wrapped-in-cloth kind, but a human female body shriveled to a husk. She wore a tie-dyed
                        sundress, lots
                        of beaded necklaces, and a headband over long black hair. The skin of her face was thin and
                        leathery over her
                        skull, and her eyes were glassy white slits, as if the real eyes had been replaced by marbles;
                        she’d been dead a
                        long, long time. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/9-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Looking at her sent chills up my back. And that was before she sat up on her
                        stool and opened
                        her mouth. A green mist poured from the mummy’s mouth, coiling over the floor in thick tendrils,
                        hissing like
                        twenty thousand snakes. I stumbled over myself trying to get to the trapdoor, but it slammed
                        shut. Inside my
                        head, I heard a voice, slithering into one ear and coiling around my brain: <em
                            class="calibre5">I am the spirit
                            of Delphi, speaker of the prophecies of Phoebus Apollo, slayer of the mighty Python.
                            Approach, seeker, and
                            ask. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to say, <em class="calibre5">No thanks, wrong door, just looking for
                            the bath</em><em class="calibre5">room. </em>But I forced myself to take a deep breath. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The mummy wasn’t alive. She was some kind of gruesome receptacle for something
                        else, the power
                        that was now swirling around me in the green mist. But its presence didn’t feel evil, like my
                        demonic math
                        teacher Mrs. Dodds or the Minotaur. It felt more like the Three Fates I’d seen knitting the yarn
                        outside the
                        highway fruit stand: ancient, powerful, and definitely <em class="calibre5">not </em>human. But
                        not particularly
                        interested in killing me, either. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got up the courage to ask, “What is my destiny?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The mist swirled more thickly, collecting right in front of me and around the
                        table with the
                        pickled monster-part jars. Suddenly there were four men sitting around the table, playing cards.
                        Their faces
                        became clearer. It was Smelly Gabe and his buddies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My fists clenched, though I knew this poker party couldn’t be real. It was an
                        illusion, made
                        out of mist. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe turned toward me and spoke in the rasping voice of the Oracle: <em
                            class="calibre5">You
                            shall go west, and face the god who has turned. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His buddy on the right looked up and said in the same voice: <em
                            class="calibre5">You shall
                            find what was stolen, and see it safely returned. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The guy on the left threw in two poker chips, then said: <em
                            class="calibre5">You shall be
                            betrayed by one who calls you a friend. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, Eddie, our building super, delivered the worst line of all: <em
                            class="calibre5">And
                            you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The figures began to dissolve. At first I was too stunned to say anything, but
                        as the mist
                        retreated, coiling into a huge green serpent and slithering back into the mouth of the mummy, I
                        cried, “Wait!
                        What do you mean? What friend? What will I fail to save?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The tail of the mist snake disappeared into the mummy’s mouth. She reclined
                        back against the
                        wall. Her mouth closed tight, as if it hadn’t been open in a hundred years. The attic was silent
                        again,
                        abandoned, nothing but a room full of mementos. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got the feeling that I could stand here until I had cobwebs, too, and I
                        wouldn’t learn
                        anything else. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">My audience with the Oracle was over. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well?” Chiron asked me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I slumped into a chair at the pinochle table. “She said I would retrieve what
                        was stolen.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover sat forward, chewing excitedly on the remains of a Diet Coke can.
                        “That’s great!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What did the Oracle say <em class="calibre5">exactly</em>?” Chiron pressed.
                        “This is
                        important.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My ears were still tingling from the reptilian voice. “She…she said I would go
                        west and face a
                        god who had turned. I would retrieve what was stolen and see it safely returned.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I knew it,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron didn’t look satisfied. “Anything else?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t want to tell him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">What friend would betray me? I didn’t have that many. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And the last line—I would fail to save what mattered most. What kind of Oracle
                        would send me on
                        a quest and tell me, <em class="calibre5">Oh, by the way, you’ll fail. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">How could I confess that? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I said. “That’s about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He studied my face. “Very well, Percy. But know this: the Oracle’s words often
                        have double
                        meanings. Don’t dwell on them too much. The truth is not always clear until events come to
                        pass.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got the feeling he knew I was holding back something bad, and he was trying
                        to make me feel
                        better. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay,” I said, anxious to change topics. “So where do I go? Who’s this god in
                        the west?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah, think, Percy,” Chiron said. “If Zeus and Poseidon weaken each other in a
                        war, who stands
                        to gain?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Somebody else who wants to take over?” I guessed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, quite. Someone who harbors a grudge, who has been unhappy with his lot
                        since the world
                        was divided eons ago, whose kingdom would grow powerful with the deaths of millions. Someone who
                        hates his
                        brothers for forcing him into an oath to have no more children, an oath that both of them have
                        now broken.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about my dreams, the evil voice that had spoken from under the
                        ground. “Hades.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron nodded. “The Lord of the Dead is the only possibility.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A scrap of aluminum dribbled out of Grover’s mouth. “Whoa, wait. Wh-what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A Fury came after Percy,” Chiron reminded him. “She watched the young man
                        until she was sure
                        of his identity, then tried to kill him. Furies obey only one lord: Hades.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, but—but Hades hates <em class="calibre5">all </em>heroes,” Grover
                        protested. “Especially
                        if he has found out Percy is a son of Poseidon.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A hellhound got into the forest,” Chiron continued. “Those can only be
                        summoned from the
                        Fields of Punishment, and it had to be summoned by someone within the camp. Hades must have a
                        spy here. He must
                        suspect Poseidon will try to use Percy to clear his name. Hades would very much like to kill
                        this young
                        half-blood before he can take on the quest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Great,” I muttered. “That’s two major gods who want to kill me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But a quest to…” Grover swallowed. “I mean, couldn’t the master bolt be in
                        some place like
                        Maine? Maine’s very nice this time of year.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hades sent a minion to steal the master bolt,” Chiron insisted. “He hid it in
                        the Underworld,
                        knowing full well that Zeus would blame Poseidon. I don’t pretend to understand the Lord of the
                        Dead’s motives
                        perfectly, or why he chose this time to start a war, but one thing is certain. Percy must go to
                        the Underworld,
                        find the master bolt, and reveal the truth.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A strange fire burned in my stomach. The weirdest thing was: it wasn’t fear. It
                        was
                        anticipation. The desire for revenge. Hades had tried to kill me three times so far, with the
                        Fury, the
                        Minotaur, and the hellhound. It was his fault my mother had disappeared in a flash of light. Now
                        he was trying
                        to frame me and my dad for a theft we hadn’t committed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was ready to take him on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Besides, if my mother was in the Underworld…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Whoa, boy, said the small part of my brain that was still sane. You’re a kid.
                        Hades is a god.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was trembling. He’d started eating pinochle cards like potato chips.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The poor guy needed to complete a quest with me so he could get his searcher’s
                        license,
                        whatever that was, but how could I ask him to do this quest, especially when the Oracle said I
                        was destined to
                        fail? This was suicide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, if we know it’s Hades,” I told Chiron, “why can’t we just tell the other
                        gods? Zeus or
                        Poseidon could go down to the Underworld and bust some heads.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Suspecting and knowing are not the same,” Chiron said. “Besides, even if the
                        other gods
                        suspect Hades—and I imagine Poseidon does—they couldn’t retrieve the bolt themselves. Gods
                        cannot cross each
                        other’s territories except by invitation. That is another ancient rule. Heroes, on the other
                        hand, have certain
                        privileges. They can go anywhere, challenge anyone, as long as they’re bold enough and strong
                        enough to do it.
                        No god can be held responsible for a hero’s actions. Why do you think the gods always operate
                        through humans?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re saying I’m being used.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m saying it’s no accident Poseidon has claimed you now. It’s a very risky
                        gamble, but he’s
                        in a desperate situation. He needs you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My dad needs me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Emotions rolled around inside me like bits of glass in a kaleidoscope. I didn’t
                        know whether to
                        feel resentful or grateful or happy or angry. Poseidon had ignored me for twelve years. Now
                        suddenly he needed
                        me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at Chiron. “You’ve known I was Poseidon’s son all along, haven’t you?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I had my suspicions. As I said…I’ve spoken to the Oracle, too.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got the feeling there was a lot he wasn’t telling me about his prophecy, but
                        I decided I
                        couldn’t worry about that right now. After all, I was holding back information too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So let me get this straight,” I said. “I’m supposed go to the Underworld and
                        confront the Lord
                        of the Dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Check,” Chiron said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Find the most powerful weapon in the universe.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Check.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And get it back to Olympus before the summer solstice, in ten days.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s about right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at Grover, who gulped down the ace of hearts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Did I mention that Maine is very nice this time of year?” he asked weakly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You don’t have to go,” I told him. “I can’t ask that of you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh…” He shifted his hooves. “No…it’s just that satyrs and underground
                        places…well…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He took a deep breath, then stood, brushing the shredded cards and aluminum
                        bits off his
                        T-shirt. “You saved my life, Percy. If…if you’re serious about wanting me along, I won’t let you
                        down.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt so relieved I wanted to cry, though I didn’t think that would be very
                        heroic. Grover was
                        the only friend I’d ever had for longer than a few months. I wasn’t sure what good a satyr could
                        do against the
                        forces of the dead, but I felt better knowing he’d be with me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All the way, G-man.” I turned to Chiron. “So where do we go? The Oracle just
                        said to go west.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The entrance to the Underworld is always in the west. It moves from age to
                        age, just like
                        Olympus. Right now, of course, it’s in America.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron looked surprised. “I thought that would be obvious enough. The entrance
                        to the
                        Underworld is in Los Angeles.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh,” I said. “Naturally. So we just get on a plane—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” Grover shrieked. “Percy, what are you thinking? Have you ever been on a
                        plane in your
                        life?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shook my head, feeling embarrassed. My mom had never taken me anywhere by
                        plane. She’d always
                        said we didn’t have the money. Besides, her parents had died in a plane crash. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, think,” Chiron said. “You are the son of the Sea God. Your father’s
                        bitterest rival is
                        Zeus, Lord of the Sky. Your mother knew better than to trust you in an airplane. You would be in
                        Zeus’s domain.
                        You would never come down again alive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Overhead, lightning crackled. Thunder boomed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay,” I said, determined not to look at the storm. “So, I’ll travel
                        overland.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s right,” Chiron said. “Two companions may accompany you. Grover is one.
                        The other has
                        already volunteered, if you will accept her help.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Gee,” I said, feigning surprise. “Who else would be stupid enough to volunteer
                        for a quest
                        like this?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The air shimmered behind Chiron. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth became visible, stuffing her Yankees cap into her back pocket. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve been waiting a long time for a quest, seaweed brain,” she said. “Athena
                        is no fan of
                        Poseidon, but if you’re going to save the world, I’m the best person to keep you from messing
                        up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If you do say so yourself,” I said. “I suppose you have a plan, wise girl?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her cheeks colored. “Do you want my help or not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The truth was, I did. I needed all the help I could get. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A trio,” I said. “That’ll work.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Excellent,” Chiron said. “This afternoon, we can take you as far as the bus
                        terminal in
                        Manhattan. After that, you are on your own.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Lightning flashed. Rain poured down on the meadows that were never supposed to
                        have violent
                        weather. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No time to waste,” Chiron said. “I think you should all get packing.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">I</span>t didn’t take me long to pack. I decided to leave
                        the Minotaur
                        horn in my cabin, which left me only an extra change of clothes and a toothbrush to stuff in a
                        backpack Grover
                        had found for me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The camp store loaned me one hundred dollars in mortal money and twenty golden
                        drachmas. These
                        coins were as big as Girl Scout cookies and had images of various Greek gods stamped on one side
                        and the Empire
                        State Building on the other. The ancient mortal drachmas had been silver, Chiron told us, but
                        Olympians never
                        used less than pure gold. Chiron said the coins might come in handy for non-mortal
                        transactions—whatever that
                        meant. He gave Annabeth and me each a canteen of nectar and a Ziploc bag full of ambrosia
                        squares, to be used
                        only in emergencies, if we were seriously hurt. It was god food, Chiron reminded us. It would
                        cure us of almost
                        any injury, but it was lethal to mortals. Too much of it would make a half-blood very, very
                        feverish. An
                        overdose would burn us up, literally. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth was bringing her magic Yankees cap, which she told me had been a
                        twelfth-birthday
                        present from her mom. She carried a book on famous classical architecture, written in Ancient
                        Greek, to read
                        when she got bored, and a long bronze knife, hidden in her shirt sleeve. I was sure the knife
                        would get us
                        busted the first time we went through a metal detector. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover wore his fake feet and his pants to pass as human. He wore a green
                        rasta-style cap,
                        because when it rained his curly hair flattened and you could just see the tips of his horns.
                        His bright orange
                        backpack was full of scrap metal and apples to snack on. In his pocket was a set of reed pipes
                        his daddy goat
                        had carved for him, even though he only knew two songs: Mozart’s Piano Concerto no. 12 and
                        Hilary Duff’s “So
                        Yesterday,” both of which sounded pretty bad on reed pipes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We waved good-bye to the other campers, took one last look at the strawberry
                        fields, the ocean,
                        and the Big House, then hiked up Half-Blood Hill to the tall pine tree that used to be Thalia,
                        daughter of Zeus.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron was waiting for us in his wheelchair. Next to him stood the surfer dude
                        I’d seen when I
                        was recovering in the sick room. According to Grover, the guy was the camp’s head of security.
                        He supposedly had
                        eyes all over his body so he could never be surprised. Today, though, he was wearing a
                        chauffeur’s uniform, so I
                        could only see extra peepers on his hands, face and neck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is Argus,” Chiron told me. “He will drive you into the city, and, er,
                        well, keep an eye
                        on things.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I heard footsteps behind us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke came running up the hill, carrying a pair of basketball shoes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” he panted. “Glad I caught you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth blushed, the way she always did when Luke was around. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just wanted to say good luck,” Luke told me. “And I thought…um, maybe you
                        could use these.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He handed me the sneakers, which looked pretty normal. They even smelled kind
                        of normal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke said, <em class="calibre5">“Maia!” </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">White bird’s wings sprouted out of the heels, startling me so much, I dropped
                        them. The shoes
                        flapped around on the ground until the wings folded up and disappeared. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/10-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Awesome!” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke smiled. “Those served me well when I was on my quest. Gift from Dad. Of
                        course, I don’t
                        use them much these days.…” His expression turned sad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t know what to say. It was cool enough that Luke had come to say
                        good-bye. I’d been
                        afraid he might resent me for getting so much attention the last few days. But here he was
                        giving me a magic
                        gift.…It made me blush almost as much as Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, man,” I said. “Thanks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Listen, Percy…” Luke looked uncomfortable. “A lot of hopes are riding on you.
                        So just…kill
                        some monsters for me, okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We shook hands. Luke patted Grover’s head between his horns, then gave a
                        good-bye hug to
                        Annabeth, who looked like she might pass out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After Luke was gone, I told her, “You’re hyperventilating.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Am not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You let him capture the flag instead of you, didn’t you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh…why do I want to go anywhere with you, Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She stomped down the other side of the hill, where a white SUV waited on the
                        shoulder of the
                        road. Argus followed, jingling his car keys. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I picked up the flying shoes and had a sudden bad feeling. I looked at Chiron.
                        “I won’t be able
                        to use these, will I?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He shook his head. “Luke meant well, Percy. But taking to the air…that would
                        not be wise for
                        you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded, disappointed, but then I got an idea. “Hey, Grover. You want a magic
                        item?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His eyes lit up. “Me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Pretty soon we’d laced the sneakers over his fake feet, and the world’s first
                        flying goat boy
                        was ready for launch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“Maia!” </em>he shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He got off the ground okay, but then fell over sideways so his backpack dragged
                        through the
                        grass. The winged shoes kept bucking up and down like tiny broncos. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Practice,” Chiron called after him. “You just need practice!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Aaaaa!” Grover went flying sideways down the hill like a possessed lawn mower,
                        heading toward
                        the van. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I could follow, Chiron caught my arm. “I should have trained you better,
                        Percy,” he
                        said. “If only I had more time. Hercules, Jason—they all got more training.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s okay. I just wish—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stopped myself because I was about to sound like a brat. I was wishing my dad
                        had given me a
                        cool magic item to help on the quest, something as good as Luke’s flying shoes, or Annabeth’s
                        invisible cap.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What am I thinking?” Chiron cried. “I can’t let you get away without this.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pulled a pen from his coat pocket and handed it to me. It was an ordinary
                        disposable
                        ballpoint, black ink, removable cap. Probably cost thirty cents. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Gee,” I said. “Thanks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, that’s a gift from your father. I’ve kept it for years, not knowing you
                        were who I was
                        waiting for. But the prophecy is clear to me now. You are the one.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I remembered the field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, when I’d
                        vaporized Mrs. Dodds.
                        Chiron had thrown me a pen that turned into a sword. Could this be…? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took off the cap, and the pen grew longer and heavier in my hand. In half a
                        second, I held a
                        shimmering bronze sword with a double-edged blade, a leather-wrapped grip, and a flat hilt
                        riveted with gold
                        studs. It was the first weapon that actually felt balanced in my hand. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/10-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“The sword has a long and tragic history that we need not go into,” Chiron told
                        me. “Its name
                        is Anaklusmos.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“‘Riptide,’” I translated, surprised the Ancient Greek came so easily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Use it only for emergencies,” Chiron said, “and only against monsters. No hero
                        should harm
                        mortals unless absolutely necessary, of course, but this sword wouldn’t harm them in any case.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at the wickedly sharp blade. “What do you mean it wouldn’t harm
                        mortals? How could it
                        not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The sword is celestial bronze. Forged by the Cyclopes, tempered in the heart
                        of Mount Etna,
                        cooled in the River Lethe. It’s deadly to monsters, to any creature from the Underworld,
                        provided they don’t
                        kill you first. But the blade will pass through mortals like an illusion. They simply are not
                        important enough
                        for the blade to kill. And I should warn you: as a demigod, you can be killed by either
                        celestial or normal
                        weapons. You are twice as vulnerable.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good to know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now recap the pen.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I touched the pen cap to the sword tip and instantly Riptide shrank to a
                        ballpoint pen again. I
                        tucked it in my pocket, a little nervous, because I was famous for losing pens at school. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You can’t,” Chiron said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Can’t what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Lose the pen,” he said. “It is enchanted. It will always reappear in your
                        pocket. Try it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was wary, but I threw the pen as far as I could down the hill and watched it
                        disappear in the
                        grass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It may take a few moments,” Chiron told me. “Now check your pocket.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Sure enough, the pen was there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay, that’s <em class="calibre5">extremely </em>cool,” I admitted. “But what
                        if a mortal sees
                        me pulling out a sword?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron smiled. “Mist is a powerful thing, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mist?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes. Read <em class="calibre5">The Iliad</em>. It’s full of references to the
                        stuff. Whenever
                        divine or monstrous elements mix with the mortal world, they generate Mist, which obscures the
                        vision of humans.
                        You will see things just as they are, being a half-blood, but humans will interpret things quite
                        differently.
                        Remarkable, really, the lengths to which humans will go to fit things into their version of
                        reality.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I put Riptide back in my pocket. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For the first time, the quest felt real. I was actually leaving Half-Blood
                        Hill. I was heading
                        west with no adult supervision, no backup plan, not even a cell phone. (Chiron said cell phones
                        were traceable
                        by monsters; if we used one, it would be worse than sending up a flare.) I had no weapon
                        stronger than a sword
                        to fight off monsters and reach the Land of the Dead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chiron…” I said. “When you say the gods are immortal…I mean, there was a time
                        <em class="calibre5">before </em>them, right?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Four ages before them, actually. The Time of the Titans was the Fourth Age,
                        sometimes called
                        the Golden Age, which is definitely a misnomer. This, the time of Western civilization and the
                        rule of Zeus, is
                        the Fifth Age.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So what was it like…before the gods?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron pursed his lips. “Even I am not old enough to remember that, child, but
                        I know it was a
                        time of darkness and savagery for mortals. Kronos, the lord of the Titans, called his reign the
                        Golden Age
                        because men lived innocent and free of all knowledge. But that was mere propaganda. The Titan
                        king cared nothing
                        for your kind except as appetizers or a source of cheap entertainment. It was only in the early
                        reign of Lord
                        Zeus, when Prometheus the good Titan brought fire to mankind, that your species began to
                        progress, and even then
                        Prometheus was branded a radical thinker. Zeus punished him severely, as you may recall. Of
                        course, eventually
                        the gods warmed to humans, and Western civilization was born.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But the gods can’t die now, right? I mean, as long as Western civilization is
                        alive, they’re
                        alive. So…even if I failed, nothing could happen so bad it would mess up <em
                            class="calibre5">every</em><em class="calibre5">thing</em>, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron gave me a melancholy smile. “No one knows how long the Age of the West
                        will last, Percy.
                        The gods are immortal, yes. But then, so were the Titans. <em class="calibre5">They </em>still
                        exist, locked
                        away in their various prisons, forced to endure endless pain and punishment, reduced in power,
                        but still very
                        much alive. May the Fates forbid that the gods should ever suffer such a doom, or that we should
                        ever return to
                        the darkness and chaos of the past. All we can do, child, is follow our destiny.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Our destiny…assuming we know what that is.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Relax,” Chiron told me. “Keep a clear head. And remember, you may be about to
                        prevent the
                        biggest war in human history.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Relax,” I said. “I’m very relaxed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When I got to the bottom of the hill, I looked back. Under the pine tree that
                        used to be
                        Thalia, daughter of Zeus, Chiron was now standing in full horse-man form, holding his bow high
                        in salute. Just
                        your typical summer-camp send-off by your typical centaur. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Argus drove us out of the countryside and into western Long Island. It felt
                        weird to be on a
                        highway again, Annabeth and Grover sitting next to me as if we were normal carpoolers. After two
                        weeks at
                        Half-Blood Hill, the real world seemed like a fantasy. I found myself staring at every
                        McDonald’s, every kid in
                        the back of his parents’ car, every billboard and shopping mall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So far so good,” I told Annabeth. “Ten miles and not a single monster.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She gave me an irritated look. “It’s bad luck to talk that way, seaweed brain.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Remind me again—why do you hate me so much?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t hate you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Could’ve fooled me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She folded her cap of invisibility. “Look…we’re just not supposed to get along,
                        okay? Our
                        parents are rivals.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She sighed. “How many reasons do you want? One time my mom caught Poseidon with
                        his girlfriend
                        in Athena’s temple, which is <em class="calibre5">hugely </em>disrespectful. Another time,
                        Athena and Poseidon
                        competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater
                        spring for his
                        gift. My mom created the olive tree. The people saw that her gift was better, so they named the
                        city after her.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They must really like olives.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, forget it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now, if she’d invented pizza—<em class="calibre5">that </em>I could
                        understand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I said, forget it!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the front seat, Argus smiled. He didn’t say anything, but one blue eye on
                        the back of his
                        neck winked at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Traffic slowed us down in Queens. By the time we got into Manhattan it was
                        sunset and starting
                        to rain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Argus dropped us at the Greyhound Station on the Upper East Side, not far from
                        my mom and
                        Gabe’s apartment. Taped to a mailbox was a soggy flyer with my picture on it: <small
                            class="calibre4">HAVE YOU
                            SEEN THIS BOY?</small> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I ripped it down before Annabeth and Grover could notice. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/10-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Argus unloaded our bags, made sure we got our bus tickets, then drove away, the
                        eye on the back
                        of his hand opening to watch us as he pulled out of the parking lot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about how close I was to my old apartment. On a normal day, my mom
                        would be home from
                        the candy store by now. Smelly Gabe was probably up there right now, playing poker, not even
                        missing her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shouldered his backpack. He gazed down the street in the direction I was
                        looking. “You
                        want to know why she married him, Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at him. “Were you reading my mind or something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just your emotions.” He shrugged. “Guess I forgot to tell you satyrs can do
                        that. You were
                        thinking about your mom and your stepdad, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded, wondering what else Grover might’ve forgotten to tell me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your mom married Gabe for <em class="calibre5">you</em>,” Grover told me. “You
                        call him
                        ‘Smelly,’ but you’ve got no idea. The guy has this aura.…Yuck. I can smell him from here. I can
                        smell traces of
                        him on you, and you haven’t been near him for a week.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thanks,” I said. “Where’s the nearest shower?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You should be grateful, Percy. Your stepfather smells so repulsively human he
                        could mask the
                        presence of any demigod. As soon as I took a whiff inside his Camaro, I knew: Gabe has been
                        covering your scent
                        for years. If you hadn’t lived with him every summer, you probably would’ve been found by
                        monsters a long time
                        ago. Your mom stayed with him to protect you. She was a smart lady. She must’ve loved you a lot
                        to put up with
                        that guy—if that makes you feel any better.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It didn’t, but I forced myself not to show it. I’ll see her again, I thought.
                        She isn’t gone.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wondered if Grover could still read my emotions, mixed up as they were. I was
                        glad he and
                        Annabeth were with me, but I felt guilty that I hadn’t been straight with them. I hadn’t told
                        them the real
                        reason I’d said yes to this crazy quest. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The truth was, I didn’t care about retrieving Zeus’s lightning bolt, or saving
                        the world, or
                        even helping my father out of trouble. The more I thought about it, I resented Poseidon for
                        never visiting me,
                        never helping my mom, never even sending a lousy child-support check. He’d only claimed me
                        because he needed a
                        job done. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All I cared about was my mom. Hades had taken her unfairly, and Hades was going
                        to give her
                        back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">You will be betrayed by one who calls you a friend,
                        </em>the Oracle
                        whispered in my mind. <em class="calibre5">You will fail to save what matters most in the end.
                        </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre15"><em class="calibre5">Shut up, </em>I told it. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The rain kept coming down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We got restless waiting for the bus and decided to play some Hacky Sack with
                        one of Grover’s
                        apples. Annabeth was unbelievable. She could bounce the apple off her knee, her elbow, her
                        shoulder, whatever. I
                        wasn’t too bad myself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The game ended when I tossed the apple toward Grover and it got too close to
                        his mouth. In one
                        mega goat bite, our Hacky Sack disappeared—core, stem, and all. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover blushed. He tried to apologize, but Annabeth and I were too busy
                        cracking up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally the bus came. As we stood in line to board, Grover started looking
                        around, sniffing the
                        air like he smelled his favorite school cafeteria delicacy—enchiladas. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What is it?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know,” he said tensely. “Maybe it’s nothing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But I could tell it wasn’t nothing. I started looking over my shoulder, too.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was relieved when we finally got on board and found seats together in the
                        back of the bus. We
                        stowed our backpacks. Annabeth kept slapping her Yankees cap nervously against her thigh. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As the last passengers got on, Annabeth clamped her hand onto my knee. “Percy.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">An old lady had just boarded the bus. She wore a crumpled velvet dress, lace
                        gloves, and a
                        shapeless orange-knit hat that shadowed her face, and she carried a big paisley purse. When she
                        tilted her head
                        up, her black eyes glittered, and my heart skipped a beat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was Mrs. Dodds. Older, more withered, but definitely the same evil face.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I scrunched down in my seat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind her came two more old ladies: one in a green hat, one in a purple hat.
                        Otherwise they
                        looked exactly like Mrs. Dodds—same gnarled hands, paisley handbags, wrinkled velvet dresses.
                        Triplet demon
                        grandmothers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They sat in the front row, right behind the driver. The two on the aisle
                        crossed their legs
                        over the walkway, making an X. It was casual enough, but it sent a clear message: nobody leaves.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bus pulled out of the station, and we headed through the slick streets of
                        Manhattan. “She
                        didn’t stay dead long,” I said, trying to keep my voice from quivering. “I thought you said they
                        could be
                        dispelled for a lifetime.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I said if you’re <em class="calibre5">lucky</em>,” Annabeth said. “You’re
                        obviously not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All three of them,” Grover whimpered. <em class="calibre5">“Di immortales!”
                        </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s okay,” Annabeth said, obviously thinking hard. “The Furies. The three
                        worst monsters from
                        the Underworld. No problem. No problem. We’ll just slip out the windows.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They don’t open,” Grover moaned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A back exit?” she suggested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There wasn’t one. Even if there had been, it wouldn’t have helped. By that
                        time, we were on
                        Ninth Avenue, heading for the Lincoln Tunnel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They won’t attack us with witnesses around,” I said. “Will they?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mortals don’t have good eyes,” Annabeth reminded me. “Their brains can only
                        process what they
                        see through the Mist.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They’ll see three old ladies killing us, won’t they?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She thought about it. “Hard to say. But we can’t count on mortals for help.
                        Maybe an emergency
                        exit in the roof…?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We hit the Lincoln Tunnel, and the bus went dark except for the running lights
                        down the aisle.
                        It was eerily quiet without the sound of the rain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds got up. In a flat voice, as if she’d rehearsed it, she announced to
                        the whole bus:
                        “I need to use the rest-room.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So do I,” said the second sister. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So do I,” said the third sister. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They all started coming down the aisle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve got it,” Annabeth said. “Percy, take my hat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re the one they want. Turn invisible and go up the aisle. Let them pass
                        you. Maybe you can
                        get to the front and get away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But you guys—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There’s an outside chance they might not notice us,” Annabeth said. “You’re a
                        son of one of
                        the Big Three. Your smell might be overpowering.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I can’t just leave you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t worry about us,” Grover said. “Go!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My hands trembled. I felt like a coward, but I took the Yankees cap and put it
                        on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When I looked down, my body wasn’t there anymore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I started creeping up the aisle. I managed to get up ten rows, then duck into
                        an empty seat
                        just as the Furies walked past. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds stopped, sniffing, and looked straight at me. My heart was pounding.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Apparently she didn’t see anything. She and her sisters kept going. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was free. I made it to the front of the bus. We were almost through the
                        Lincoln Tunnel now. I
                        was about to press the emergency stop button when I heard hideous wailing from the back row.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The old ladies were not old ladies anymore. Their faces were still the same—I
                        guess those
                        couldn’t get any uglier—but their bodies had shriveled into leathery brown hag bodies with bat’s
                        wings and hands
                        and feet like gargoyle claws. Their handbags had turned into fiery whips. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/10-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The Furies surrounded Grover and Annabeth, lashing their whips, hissing: “Where
                        is it? Where?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The other people on the bus were screaming, cowering in their seats. They saw
                        <em class="calibre5">something</em>, all right.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s not here!” Annabeth yelled. “He’s gone!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Furies raised their whips. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth drew her bronze knife. Grover grabbed a tin can from his snack bag and
                        prepared to
                        throw it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">What I did next was so impulsive and dangerous I should’ve been named ADHD
                        poster child of the
                        year. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bus driver was distracted, trying to see what was going on in his rearview
                        mirror. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Still invisible, I grabbed the wheel from him and jerked it to the left.
                        Everybody howled as
                        they were thrown to the right, and I heard what I hoped was the sound of three Furies smashing
                        against the
                        windows. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” the driver yelled. “Hey—whoa!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We wrestled for the wheel. The bus slammed against the side of the tunnel,
                        grinding metal,
                        throwing sparks a mile behind us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We careened out of the Lincoln Tunnel and back into the rainstorm, people and
                        monsters tossed
                        around the bus, cars plowed aside like bowling pins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Somehow the driver found an exit. We shot off the highway, through half a dozen
                        traffic lights,
                        and ended up barreling down one of those New Jersey rural roads where you can’t believe there’s
                        so much nothing
                        right across the river from New York. There were woods to our left, the Hudson River to our
                        right, and the
                        driver seemed to be veering toward the river. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Another great idea: I hit the emergency brake. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bus wailed, spun a full circle on the wet asphalt, and crashed into the
                        trees. The
                        emergency lights came on. The door flew open. The bus driver was the first one out, the
                        passengers yelling as
                        they stampeded after him. I stepped into the driver’s seat and let them pass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Furies regained their balance. They lashed their whips at Annabeth while
                        she waved her
                        knife and yelled in Ancient Greek, telling them to back off. Grover threw tin cans. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at the open doorway. I was free to go, but I couldn’t leave my
                        friends. I took off the
                        invisible cap. “Hey!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Furies turned, baring their yellow fangs at me, and the exit suddenly
                        seemed like an
                        excellent idea. Mrs. Dodds stalked up the aisle, just as she used to do in class, about to
                        deliver my F– math
                        test. Every time she flicked her whip, red flames danced along the barbed leather. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her two ugly sisters hopped on top of the seats on either side of her and
                        crawled toward me
                        like huge nasty lizards. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Perseus Jackson,” Mrs. Dodds said, in an accent that was definitely from
                        somewhere farther
                        south than Georgia. “You have offended the gods. You shall die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I liked you better as a math teacher,” I told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She growled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and Grover moved up behind the Furies cautiously, looking for an
                        opening. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took the ballpoint pen out of my pocket and uncapped it. Riptide elongated
                        into a shimmering
                        double-edged sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Furies hesitated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds had felt Riptide’s blade before. She obviously didn’t like seeing it
                        again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Submit now,” she hissed. “And you will not suffer eternal torment.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nice try,” I told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, look out!” Annabeth cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds lashed her whip around my sword hand while the Furies on the either
                        side lunged at
                        me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My hand felt like it was wrapped in molten lead, but I managed not to drop
                        Riptide. I stuck the
                        Fury on the left with its hilt, sending her toppling backward into a seat. I turned and sliced
                        the Fury on the
                        right. As soon as the blade connected with her neck, she screamed and exploded into dust.
                        Annabeth got Mrs.
                        Dodds in a wrestler’s hold and yanked her backward while Grover ripped the whip out of her
                        hands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ow!” he yelled. “Ow! Hot! Hot!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Fury I’d hilt-slammed came at me again, talons ready, but I swung Riptide
                        and she broke
                        open like a piñata. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mrs. Dodds was trying to get Annabeth off her back. She kicked, clawed, hissed
                        and bit, but
                        Annabeth held on while Grover got Mrs. Dodds’s legs tied up in her own whip. Finally they both
                        shoved her
                        backward into the aisle. Mrs. Dodds tried to get up, but she didn’t have room to flap her bat
                        wings, so she kept
                        falling down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Zeus will destroy you!” she promised. “Hades will have your soul!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“Braccas meas vescimini!” </em>I yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t sure where the Latin came from. I think it meant “Eat my pants!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder shook the bus. The hair rose on the back of my neck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Get out!” Annabeth yelled at me. “Now!” I didn’t need any encouragement. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We rushed outside and found the other passengers wandering around in a daze,
                        arguing with the
                        driver, or running around in circles yelling, “We’re going to die!” A Hawaiian shirted tourist
                        with a camera
                        snapped my photograph before I could recap my sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Our bags!” Grover realized. “We left our—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">BOOOOOM!</em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The windows of the bus exploded as the passengers ran for cover. Lightning
                        shredded a huge
                        crater in the roof, but an angry wail from inside told me Mrs. Dodds was not yet dead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Run!” Annabeth said. “She’s calling for reinforcements! We have to get out of
                        here!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We plunged into the woods as the rain poured down, the bus in flames behind us,
                        and nothing but
                        darkness ahead. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">I</span>n a way, it’s nice to know there are Greek gods
                        out there, because
                        you have somebody to blame when things go wrong. For instance, when you’re walking away from a
                        bus that’s just
                        been attacked by monster hags and blown up by lightning, and it’s raining on top of everything
                        else, most people
                        might think that’s just really bad luck; when you’re a half-blood, you understand that some
                        divine force really
                        is trying to mess up your day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">So there we were, Annabeth and Grover and I, walking through the woods along
                        the New Jersey
                        riverbank, the glow of New York City making the night sky yellow behind us, and the smell of the
                        Hudson reeking
                        in our noses. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was shivering and braying, his big goat eyes turned slit-pupiled and
                        full of terror.
                        “Three Kindly Ones. All three at once.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was pretty much in shock myself. The explosion of bus windows still rang in
                        my ears. But
                        Annabeth kept pulling us along, saying: “Come on! The farther away we get, the better.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All our money was back there,” I reminded her. “Our food and clothes.
                        Everything.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, maybe if you hadn’t decided to jump into the fight—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What did you want me to do? Let you get killed?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You didn’t need to protect me, Percy. I would’ve been fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sliced like sandwich bread,” Grover put in, “but fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shut up, goat boy,” said Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover brayed mournfully. “Tin cans…a perfectly good bag of tin cans.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We sloshed across mushy ground, through nasty twisted trees that smelled like
                        sour laundry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After a few minutes, Annabeth fell into line next to me. “Look, I…” Her voice
                        faltered. “I
                        appreciate your coming back for us, okay? That was really brave.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re a team, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was silent for a few more steps. “It’s just that if you died…aside from the
                        fact that it
                        would really suck for you, it would mean the quest was over. This may be my only chance to see
                        the real world.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The thunderstorm had finally let up. The city glow faded behind us, leaving us
                        in almost total
                        darkness. I couldn’t see anything of Annabeth except a glint of her blond hair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You haven’t left Camp Half-Blood since you were seven?” I asked her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No…only short field trips. My dad—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The history professor.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah. It didn’t work out for me living at home. I mean, Camp Half-Blood <em
                            class="calibre5">is </em>my home.” She was rushing her words out now, as if she were afraid
                        somebody might
                        try to stop her. “At camp you train and train. And that’s all cool and everything, but the real
                        world is where
                        the monsters are. That’s where you learn whether you’re any good or not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">If I didn’t know better, I could’ve sworn I heard doubt in her voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re pretty good with that knife,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You think so?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Anybody who can piggyback-ride a Fury is okay by me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t really see, but I thought she might’ve smiled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You know,” she said, “maybe I should tell you…Something funny back on the
                        bus…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Whatever she wanted to say was interrupted by a shrill <em
                            class="calibre5">toot-toot-toot</em>, like the sound of an owl being tortured. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, my reed pipes still work!” Grover cried. “If I could just remember a
                        ‘find path’ song, we
                        could get out of these woods!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He puffed out a few notes, but the tune still sounded suspiciously like Hilary
                        Duff. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Instead of finding a path, I immediately slammed into a tree and got a
                        nice-size knot on my
                        head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Add to the list of superpowers I did <em class="calibre5">not </em>have:
                        infrared vision. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After tripping and cursing and generally feeling miserable for another mile or
                        so, I started to
                        see light up ahead: the colors of a neon sign. I could smell food. Fried, greasy, excellent
                        food. I realized I
                        hadn’t eaten anything unhealthy since I’d arrived at Half-Blood Hill, where we lived on grapes,
                        bread, cheese,
                        and extra-lean-cut nymph-prepared barbecue. This boy needed a double cheeseburger. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We kept walking until I saw a deserted two-lane road through the trees. On the
                        other side was a
                        closed-down gas station, a tattered billboard for a 1990s movie, and one open business, which
                        was the source of
                        the neon light and the good smell. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It wasn’t a fast-food restaurant like I’d hoped. It was one of those weird
                        roadside curio shops
                        that sell lawn flamingos and wooden Indians and cement grizzly bears and stuff like that. The
                        main building was
                        a long, low warehouse, surrounded by acres of statuary. The neon sign above the gate was
                        impossible for me to
                        read, because if there’s anything worse for my dyslexia than regular English, it’s red cursive
                        neon English.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">To me, it looked like: <em class="calibre5">ATNYU MES GDERAN GOMEN MEPROUIM.
                        </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What the heck does that say?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She loved reading so much, I’d forgotten she was dyslexic, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover translated: “Aunty Em’s Garden Gnome Emporium.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/11-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Flanking the entrance, as advertised, were two cement garden gnomes, ugly
                        bearded little runts,
                        smiling and waving, as if they were about to get their picture taken. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I crossed the street, following the smell of the hamburgers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey…” Grover warned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The lights are on inside,” Annabeth said. “Maybe it’s open.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Snack bar,” I said wistfully. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Snack bar,” she agreed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are you two crazy?” Grover said. “This place is weird.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We ignored him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The front lot was a forest of statues: cement animals, cement children, even a
                        cement satyr
                        playing the pipes, which gave Grover the creeps. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“Bla-ha-ha!” </em>he bleated. “Looks like my Uncle
                        Ferdinand!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We stopped at the warehouse door. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t knock,” Grover pleaded. “I smell monsters.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your nose is clogged up from the Furies,” Annabeth told him. “All I smell is
                        burgers. Aren’t
                        you hungry?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Meat!” he said scornfully. “I’m a vegetarian.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You eat cheese enchiladas and aluminum cans,” I reminded him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Those are vegetables. Come on. Let’s leave. These statues are…looking at me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then the door creaked open, and standing in front of us was a tall Middle
                        Eastern woman—at
                        least, I assumed she was Middle Eastern, because she wore a long black gown that covered
                        everything but her
                        hands, and her head was completely veiled. Her eyes glinted behind a curtain of black gauze, but
                        that was about
                        all I could make out. Her coffee-colored hands looked old, but well-manicured and elegant, so I
                        imagined she was
                        a grandmother who had once been a beautiful lady. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her accent sounded vaguely Middle Eastern, too. She said, “Children, it is too
                        late to be out
                        all alone. Where are your parents?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They’re…um…” Annabeth started to say. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re orphans,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Orphans?” the woman said. The word sounded alien in her mouth. “But, my dears!
                        Surely not!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We got separated from our caravan,” I said. “Our circus caravan. The
                        ringmaster told us to
                        meet him at the gas station if we got lost, but he may have forgotten, or maybe he meant a
                        different gas
                        station. Anyway, we’re lost. Is that food I smell?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, my dears,” the woman said. “You must come in, poor children. I am Aunty
                        Em. Go straight
                        through to the back of the warehouse, please. There is a dining area.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We thanked her and went inside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth muttered to me, “Circus caravan?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Always have a strategy, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your head is full of kelp.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The warehouse was filled with more statues—people in all different poses,
                        wearing all different
                        outfits and with different expressions on their faces. I was thinking you’d have to have a
                        pretty huge garden to
                        fit even one of these statues, because they were all life-size. But mostly, I was thinking about
                        food. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Go ahead, call me an idiot for walking into a strange lady’s shop like that
                        just because I was
                        hungry, but I do impulsive stuff sometimes. Plus, you’ve never smelled Aunty Em’s burgers. The
                        aroma was like
                        laughing gas in the dentist’s chair—it made everything else go away. I barely noticed Grover’s
                        nervous whimpers,
                        or the way the statues’ eyes seemed to follow me, or the fact that Aunty Em had locked the door
                        behind us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All I cared about was finding the dining area. And sure enough, there it was at
                        the back of the
                        warehouse, a fast-food counter with a grill, a soda fountain, a pretzel heater, and a nacho
                        cheese dispenser.
                        Everything you could want, plus a few steel picnic tables out front. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Please, sit down,” Aunty Em said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Awesome,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um,” Grover said reluctantly, “we don’t have any money, ma’am.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I could jab him in the ribs, Aunty Em said, “No, no, children. No money.
                        This is a
                        special case, yes? It is my treat, for such nice orphans.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thank you, ma’am,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Aunty Em stiffened, as if Annabeth had done something wrong, but then the old
                        woman relaxed
                        just as quickly, so I figured it must’ve been my imagination. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Quite all right, Annabeth,” she said. “You have such beautiful gray eyes,
                        child.” Only later
                        did I wonder how she knew Annabeth’s name, even though we had never introduced ourselves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Our hostess disappeared behind the snack counter and started cooking. Before we
                        knew it, she’d
                        brought us plastic trays heaped with double cheeseburgers, vanilla shakes, and XXL servings of
                        French fries.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was halfway through my burger before I remembered to breathe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth slurped her shake. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover picked at the fries, and eyed the tray’s waxed paper liner as if he
                        might go for that,
                        but he still looked too nervous to eat. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/11-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s that hissing noise?” he asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I listened, but didn’t hear anything. Annabeth shook her head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hissing?” Aunty Em asked. “Perhaps you hear the deep-fryer oil. You have keen
                        ears, Grover.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I take vitamins. For my ears.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s admirable,” she said. “But please, relax.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Aunty Em ate nothing. She hadn’t taken off her headdress, even to cook, and now
                        she sat forward
                        and interlaced her fingers and watched us eat. It was a little unsettling, having someone stare
                        at me when I
                        couldn’t see her face, but I was feeling satisfied after the burger, and a little sleepy, and I
                        figured the
                        least I could do was try to make small talk with our hostess. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So, you sell gnomes,” I said, trying to sound interested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, yes,” Aunty Em said. “And animals. And people. Anything for the garden.
                        Custom orders.
                        Statuary is very popular, you know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A lot of business on this road?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not so much, no. Since the highway was built…most cars, they do not go this
                        way now. I must
                        cherish every customer I get.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My neck tingled, as if somebody else was looking at me. I turned, but it was
                        just a statue of a
                        young girl holding an Easter basket. The detail was incredible, much better than you see in most
                        garden statues.
                        But something was wrong with her face. It looked as if she were startled, or even terrified.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah,” Aunty Em said sadly. “You notice some of my creations do not turn out
                        well. They are
                        marred. They do not sell. The face is the hardest to get right. Always the face.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You make these statues yourself ?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, yes. Once upon a time, I had two sisters to help me in the business, but
                        they have passed
                        on, and Aunty Em is alone. I have only my statues. This is why I make them, you see. They are my
                        company.” The
                        sadness in her voice sounded so deep and so real that I couldn’t help feeling sorry for her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth had stopped eating. She sat forward and said, “Two sisters?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s a terrible story,” Aunty Em said. “Not one for children, really. You see,
                        Annabeth, a bad
                        woman was jealous of me, long ago, when I was young. I had a…a boyfriend, you know, and this bad
                        woman was
                        determined to break us apart. She caused a terrible accident. My sisters stayed by me. They
                        shared my bad
                        fortune as long as they could, but eventually they passed on. They faded away. I alone have
                        survived, but at a
                        price. Such a price.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t sure what she meant, but I felt bad for her. My eyelids kept getting
                        heavier, my full
                        stomach making me sleepy. Poor old lady. Who would want to hurt somebody so nice? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy?” Annabeth was shaking me to get my attention. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe we should go. I mean, the ringmaster will be waiting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She sounded tense. I wasn’t sure why. Grover was eating the waxed paper off the
                        tray now, but
                        if Aunty Em found that strange, she didn’t say anything. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Such beautiful gray eyes,” Aunty Em told Annabeth again. “My, yes, it has been
                        a long time
                        since I’ve seen gray eyes like those.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She reached out as if to stroke Annabeth’s cheek, but Annabeth stood up
                        abruptly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We really should go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes!” Grover swallowed his waxed paper and stood up. “The ringmaster is
                        waiting! Right!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t want to leave. I felt full and content. Aunty Em was so nice. I wanted
                        to stay with
                        her a while. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Please, dears,” Aunty Em pleaded. “I so rarely get to be with children. Before
                        you go, won’t
                        you at least sit for a pose?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A pose?” Annabeth asked warily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A photograph. I will use it to model a new statue set. Children are so
                        popular, you see.
                        Everyone loves children.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shifted her weight from foot to foot. “I don’t think we can, ma’am.
                        Come on, Percy—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sure we can,” I said. I was irritated with Annabeth for being so bossy, so
                        rude to an old lady
                        who’d just fed us for free. “It’s just a photo, Annabeth. What’s the harm?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, Annabeth,” the woman purred. “No harm.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could tell Annabeth didn’t like it, but she allowed Aunty Em to lead us back
                        out the front
                        door, into the garden of statues. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Aunty Em directed us to a park bench next to the stone satyr. “Now,” she said,
                        “I’ll just
                        position you correctly. The young girl in the middle, I think, and the two young gentlemen on
                        either side.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not much light for a photo,” I remarked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, enough,” Aunty Em said. “Enough for us to see each other, yes?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where’s your camera?” Grover asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Aunty Em stepped back, as if to admire the shot. “Now, the face is the most
                        difficult. Can you
                        smile for me please, everyone? A large smile?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover glanced at the cement satyr next to him, and mumbled, “That sure does
                        look like Uncle
                        Ferdinand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover,” Aunty Em chastised, “look this way, dear.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She still had no camera in her hands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy—” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Some instinct warned me to listen to Annabeth, but I was fighting the sleepy
                        feeling, the
                        comfortable lull that came from the food and the old lady’s voice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I will just be a moment,” Aunty Em said. “You know, I can’t see you very well
                        in this cursed
                        veil.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, something’s wrong,” Annabeth insisted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wrong?” Aunty Em said, reaching up to undo the wrap around her head. “Not at
                        all, dear. I have
                        such noble company tonight. What could be wrong?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That <em class="calibre5">is </em>Uncle Ferdinand!” Grover gasped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look away from her!” Annabeth shouted. She whipped her Yankees cap onto her
                        head and vanished.
                        Her invisible hands pushed Grover and me both off the bench. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was on the ground, looking at Aunt Em’s sandaled feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could hear Grover scrambling off in one direction, Annabeth in another. But I
                        was too dazed
                        to move. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I heard a strange, rasping sound above me. My eyes rose to Aunty Em’s
                        hands, which had
                        turned gnarled and warty, with sharp bronze talons for fingernails. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I almost looked higher, but somewhere off to my left Annabeth screamed, “No!
                        Don’t!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">More rasping—the sound of tiny snakes, right above me, from…from about where
                        Aunty Em’s head
                        would be. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Run!” Grover bleated. I heard him racing across the gravel, yelling, <em
                            class="calibre5">“Maia!” </em>to kick-start his flying sneakers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t move. I stared at Aunty Em’s gnarled claws, and tried to fight the
                        groggy trance the
                        old woman had put me in. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Such a pity to destroy a handsome young face,” she told me soothingly. “Stay
                        with me, Percy.
                        All you have to do is look up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I fought the urge to obey. Instead I looked to one side and saw one of those
                        glass spheres
                        people put in gardens—a gazing ball. I could see Aunty Em’s dark reflection in the orange glass;
                        her headdress
                        was gone, revealing her face as a shimmering pale circle. Her hair was moving, writhing like
                        serpents. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">Aunty Em. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Aunty “M.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">How could I have been so stupid? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Think, I told myself. How did Medusa die in the myth? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But I couldn’t think. Something told me that in the myth Medusa had been asleep
                        when she was
                        attacked by my namesake, Perseus. She wasn’t anywhere near asleep now. If she wanted, she could
                        take those
                        talons right now and rake open my face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Gray-Eyed One did this to me, Percy,” Medusa said, and she didn’t sound
                        anything like a
                        monster. Her voice invited me to look up, to sympathize with a poor old grandmother. “Annabeth’s
                        mother, the
                        cursed Athena, turned me from a beautiful woman into this.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t listen to her!” Annabeth’s voice shouted, somewhere in the statuary.
                        “Run, Percy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Silence!” Medusa snarled. Then her voice modulated back to a comforting purr.
                        “You see why I
                        must destroy the girl, Percy. She is my enemy’s daughter. I shall crush her statue to dust. But
                        you, dear Percy,
                        you need not suffer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I muttered. I tried to make my legs move. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Do you really want to help the gods?” Medusa asked. “Do you understand what
                        awaits you on this
                        foolish quest, Percy? What will happen if you reach the Underworld? <em class="calibre5">Do not
                            be a pawn of the
                            Olympians, my dear. You would be better off as a statue</em>. Less pain. Less pain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Behind me, I heard a buzzing sound, like a two-hundred-pound
                        hummingbird in a
                        nosedive. Grover yelled, “Duck!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned, and there he was in the night sky, flying in from twelve o’clock with
                        his winged
                        shoes fluttering, Grover, holding a tree branch the size of a baseball bat. His eyes were shut
                        tight, his head
                        twitched from side to side. He was navigating by ears and nose alone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Duck!” he yelled again. “I’ll get her!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That finally jolted me into action. Knowing Grover, I was sure he’d miss Medusa
                        and nail me. I
                        dove to one side. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Thwack!</em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At first I figured it was the sound of Grover hitting a tree. Then Medusa
                        roared with rage.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You miserable satyr,” she snarled. “I’ll add you to my collection!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That was for Uncle Ferdinand!” Grover yelled back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I scrambled away and hid in the statuary while Grover swooped down for another
                        pass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Ker-whack!</em> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Arrgh!” Medusa yelled, her snake-hair hissing and spitting. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Right next to me, Annabeth’s voice said, “Percy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I jumped so high my feet nearly cleared a garden gnome. “Jeez! Don’t do that!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth took off her Yankees cap and became visible. “You have to cut her head
                        off.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What? Are you crazy? Let’s get out of here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Medusa is a menace. She’s evil. I’d kill her myself, but…” Annabeth swallowed,
                        as if she were
                        about to make a difficult admission. “But you’ve got the better weapon. Besides, I’d never get
                        close to her.
                        She’d slice me to bits because of my mother. You—you’ve got a chance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What? I can’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look, do you want her turning more innocent people into statues?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pointed to a pair of statue lovers, a man and a woman with their arms
                        around each other,
                        turned to stone by the monster. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth grabbed a green gazing ball from a nearby pedestal. “A polished shield
                        would be
                        better.” She studied the sphere critically. “The convexity will cause some distortion. The
                        reflection’s size
                        should be off by a factor of—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Would you speak English?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I <em class="calibre5">am</em>!” She tossed me the glass ball. “Just look at
                        her in the glass.
                        <em class="calibre5">Never </em>look at her directly.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, guys!” Grover yelled somewhere above us. “I think she’s unconscious!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">Roooaaarrr</em>!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe not,” Grover corrected. He went in for another pass with the tree
                        branch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hurry,” Annabeth told me. “Grover’s got a great nose, but he’ll eventually
                        crash.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took out my pen and uncapped it. The bronze blade of Riptide elongated in my
                        hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I followed the hissing and spitting sounds of Medusa’s hair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I kept my eyes locked on the gazing ball so I would only glimpse Medusa’s
                        reflection, not the
                        real thing. Then, in the green tinted glass, I saw her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was coming in for another turn at bat, but this time he flew a little
                        too low. Medusa
                        grabbed the stick and pulled him off course. He tumbled through the air and crashed into the
                        arms of a stone
                        grizzly bear with a painful “Ummphh!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Medusa was about to lunge at him when I yelled, “Hey!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I advanced on her, which wasn’t easy, holding a sword and a glass ball. If she
                        charged, I’d
                        have a hard time defending myself. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But she let me approach—twenty feet, ten feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could see the reflection of her face now. Surely it wasn’t really <em
                            class="calibre5">that
                        </em>ugly. The green swirls of the gazing ball must be distorting it, making it look worse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You wouldn’t harm an old woman, Percy,” she crooned. “I know you wouldn’t.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hesitated, fascinated by the face I saw reflected in the glass—the eyes that
                        seemed to burn
                        straight through the green tint, making my arms go weak. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">From the cement grizzly, Grover moaned, “Percy, don’t listen to her!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Medusa cackled. “Too late.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She lunged at me with her talons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I slashed up with my sword, heard a sickening <em
                            class="calibre5">shlock!</em>, then a hiss
                        like wind rushing out of a cavern—the sound of a monster disintegrating. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Something fell to the ground next to my foot. It took all my willpower not to
                        look. I could
                        feel warm ooze soaking into my sock, little dying snake heads tugging at my shoelaces. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, yuck,” Grover said. His eyes were still tightly closed, but I guess he
                        could hear the
                        thing gurgling and steaming. “Mega-yuck.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth came up next to me, her eyes fixed on the sky. She was holding
                        Medusa’s black veil.
                        She said, “Don’t move.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Very, very carefully, without looking down, she knelt and draped the monster’s
                        head in black
                        cloth, then picked it up. It was still dripping green juice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are you okay?” she asked me, her voice trembling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” I decided, though I felt like throwing up my double cheeseburger. “Why
                        didn’t…why
                        didn’t the head evaporate?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Once you sever it, it becomes a spoil of war,” she said. “Same as your
                        minotaur horn. But
                        don’t unwrap the head. It can still petrify you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover moaned as he climbed down from the grizzly statue. He had a big welt on
                        his forehead.
                        His green rasta cap hung from one of his little goat horns, and his fake feet had been knocked
                        off his hooves.
                        The magic sneakers were flying aimlessly around his head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Red Baron,” I said. “Good job, man.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He managed a bashful grin. “That really was <em class="calibre5">not </em>fun,
                        though. Well,
                        the hitting-her-with-a-stick part, that was fun. But crashing into a concrete bear? <em
                            class="calibre5">Not
                        </em>fun.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He snatched his shoes out of the air. I recapped my sword. Together, the three
                        of us stumbled
                        back to the warehouse. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We found some old plastic grocery bags behind the snack counter and
                        double-wrapped Medusa’s
                        head. We plopped it on the table where we’d eaten dinner and sat around it, too exhausted to
                        speak. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally I said, “So we have Athena to thank for this monster?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth flashed me an irritated look. “Your dad, actually. Don’t you remember?
                        Medusa was
                        Poseidon’s girlfriend. They decided to meet in my mother’s temple. That’s why Athena turned her
                        into a monster.
                        Medusa and her two sisters who had helped her get into the temple, they became the three
                        gorgons. That’s why
                        Medusa wanted to slice me up, but she wanted to preserve you as a nice statue. She’s still sweet
                        on your dad.
                        You probably reminded her of him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My face was burning. “Oh, so now it’s <em class="calibre5">my </em>fault we met
                        Medusa.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth straightened. In a bad imitation of my voice, she said: “‘It’s just a
                        photo, Annabeth.
                        What’s the harm?’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Forget it,” I said. “You’re impossible.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re insufferable.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” Grover interrupted. “You two are giving me a migraine, and satyrs don’t
                        even <em class="calibre5">get </em>migraines. What are we going to do with the head?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the thing. One little snake was hanging out of a hole in the
                        plastic. The words
                        printed on the side of the bag said: <small class="calibre4">WE APPRECIATE YOUR
                            BUSINESS!</small> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was angry, not just with Annabeth or her mom, but with all the gods for this
                        whole quest, for
                        getting us blown off the road and in two major fights the very first day out from camp. At this
                        rate, we’d never
                        make it to L.A. alive, much less before the summer solstice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">What had Medusa said? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Do not be a pawn of the Olympians, my dear. You would be better off as a
                        statue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got up. “I’ll be back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Annabeth called after me. “What are you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I searched the back of the warehouse until I found Medusa’s office. Her account
                        book showed her
                        six most recent sales, all shipments to the Underworld to decorate Hades and Persephone’s
                        garden. According to
                        one freight bill, the Underworld’s billing address was DOA Recording Studios, West Hollywood,
                        California. I
                        folded up the bill and stuffed it in my pocket. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the cash register I found twenty dollars, a few golden drachmas, and some
                        packing slips for
                        Hermes Overnight Express, each with a little leather bag attached for coins. I rummaged around
                        the rest of the
                        office until I found the right-size box. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I went back to the picnic table, packed up Medusa’s head, and filled out a
                        delivery slip: </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“They’re not going to like that,” Grover warned. “They’ll think you’re
                        impertinent.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I poured some golden drachmas in the pouch. As soon as I closed it, there was a
                        sound like a
                        cash register. The package floated off the table and disappeared with a <em
                            class="calibre5">pop! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I <em class="calibre5">am </em>impertinent,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at Annabeth, daring her to criticize. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She didn’t. She seemed resigned to the fact that I had a major talent for
                        ticking off the gods.
                        “Come on,” she muttered. “We need a new plan.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">W</span>e were pretty miserable that night. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We camped out in the woods, a hundred yards from the main road, in a marshy
                        clearing that local
                        kids had obviously been using for parties. The ground was littered with flattened soda cans and
                        fast-food
                        wrappers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We’d taken some food and blankets from Aunty Em’s, but we didn’t dare light a
                        fire to dry our
                        damp clothes. The Furies and Medusa had provided enough excitement for one day. We didn’t want
                        to attract
                        anything else. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We decided to sleep in shifts. I volunteered to take first watch. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth curled up on the blankets and was snoring as soon as her head hit the
                        ground. Grover
                        fluttered with his flying shoes to the lowest bough of a tree, put his back to the trunk, and
                        stared at the
                        night sky. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Go ahead and sleep,” I told him. “I’ll wake you if there’s trouble.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He nodded, but still didn’t close his eyes. “It makes me sad, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What does? The fact that you signed up for this stupid quest?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. <em class="calibre5">This </em>makes me sad.” He pointed at all the
                        garbage on the ground.
                        “And the sky. You can’t even see the stars. They’ve polluted the sky. This is a terrible time to
                        be a satyr.”
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, yeah. I guess you’d be an environmentalist.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He glared at me. “Only a human wouldn’t be. Your species is clogging up the
                        world so fast…ah,
                        never mind. It’s useless to lecture a human. At the rate things are going, I’ll never find Pan.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Pam? Like the cooking spray?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Pan!” he cried indignantly. “P-A-N. The great god Pan! What do you think I
                        want a searcher’s
                        license for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A strange breeze rustled through the clearing, temporarily overpowering the
                        stink of trash and
                        muck. It brought the smell of berries and wildflowers and clean rainwater, things that might’ve
                        once been in
                        these woods. Suddenly I was nostalgic for something I’d never known. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Tell me about the search,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover looked at me cautiously, as if he were afraid I was just making fun.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The God of Wild Places disappeared two thousand years ago,” he told me. “A
                        sailor off the
                        coast of Ephesos heard a mysterious voice crying out from the shore, ‘Tell them that the great
                        god Pan has
                        died!’ When humans heard the news, they believed it. They’ve been pillaging Pan’s kingdom ever
                        since. But for
                        the satyrs, Pan was our lord and master. He protected us and the wild places of the earth. We
                        refuse to believe
                        that he died. In every generation, the bravest satyrs pledge their lives to finding Pan. They
                        search the earth,
                        exploring all the wildest places, hoping to find where he is hidden, and wake him from his
                        sleep.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And you want to be a searcher.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s my life’s dream,” he said. “My father was a searcher. And my Uncle
                        Ferdinand…the statue
                        you saw back there—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, right, sorry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shook his head. “Uncle Ferdinand knew the risks. So did my dad. But I’ll
                        succeed. I’ll
                        be the first searcher to return alive.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hang on—<em class="calibre5">the first?</em>” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover took his reed pipes out of his pocket. “No searcher has ever come back.
                        Once they set
                        out, they disappear. They’re never seen alive again.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not once in two thousand years?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And your dad? You have no idea what happened to him?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“None.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But you still want to go,” I said, amazed. “I mean, you really think you’ll be
                        the one to find
                        Pan?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have to believe that, Percy. Every searcher does. It’s the only thing that
                        keeps us from
                        despair when we look at what humans have done to the world. I have to believe Pan can still be
                        awakened.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the orange haze of the sky and tried to understand how Grover could
                        pursue a dream
                        that seemed so hopeless. Then again, was I any better? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How are we going to get into the Underworld?” I asked him. “I mean, what
                        chance do we have
                        against a god?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know,” he admitted. “But back at Medusa’s, when you were searching her
                        office?
                        Annabeth was telling me—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, I forgot. Annabeth will have a plan all figured out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t be so hard on her, Percy. She’s had a tough life, but she’s a good
                        person. After all,
                        she forgave me.…” His voice faltered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean?” I asked. “Forgave you for what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Suddenly, Grover seemed very interested in playing notes on his pipes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait a minute,” I said. “Your first keeper job was five years ago. Annabeth
                        has been at camp
                        five years. She wasn’t…I mean, your first assignment that went wrong—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I can’t talk about it,” Grover said, and his quivering lower lip suggested
                        he’d start crying
                        if I pressed him. “But as I was saying, back at Medusa’s, Annabeth and I agreed there’s
                        something strange going
                        on with this quest. Something isn’t what it seems.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, duh. I’m getting blamed for stealing a thunderbolt that Hades took.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s not what I mean,” Grover said. “The Fur—The Kindly Ones were sort of
                        holding back. Like
                        Mrs. Dodds at Yancy Academy…why did she wait so long to try to kill you? Then on the bus, they
                        just weren’t as
                        aggressive as they could’ve been.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They seemed plenty aggressive to me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shook his head. “They were screeching at us: ‘Where is it? Where?’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Asking about me,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe…but Annabeth and I, we both got the feeling they weren’t asking about a
                        person. They
                        said ‘Where is <em class="calibre5">it</em>?’ They seemed to be asking about an object.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That doesn’t make sense.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know. But if we’ve misunderstood something about this quest, and we only
                        have nine days to
                        find the master bolt.…” He looked at me like he was hoping for answers, but I didn’t have any.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about what Medusa had said: I was being used by the gods. What lay
                        ahead of me was
                        worse than petrification. “I haven’t been straight with you,” I told Grover. “I don’t care about
                        the master
                        bolt. I agreed to go to the Underworld so I could bring back my mother.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover blew a soft note on his pipes. “I know that, Percy. But are you sure
                        that’s the only
                        reason?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m not doing it to help my father. He doesn’t care about me. I don’t care
                        about him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover gazed down from his tree branch. “Look, Percy, I’m not as smart as
                        Annabeth. I’m not as
                        brave as you. But I’m pretty good at reading emotions. You’re glad your dad is alive. You feel
                        good that he’s
                        claimed you, and part of you wants to make him proud. That’s why you mailed Medusa’s head to
                        Olympus. You wanted
                        him to notice what you’d done.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah? Well maybe satyr emotions work differently than human emotions. Because
                        you’re wrong. I
                        don’t care what he thinks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover pulled his feet up onto the branch. “Okay, Percy. Whatever.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Besides, I haven’t done anything worth bragging about. We barely got out of
                        New York and we’re
                        stuck here with no money and no way west.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover looked at the night sky, like he was thinking about that problem. “How
                        about <em class="calibre5">I </em>take first watch, huh? You get some sleep.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wanted to protest, but he started to play Mozart, soft and sweet, and I
                        turned away, my eyes
                        stinging. After a few bars of Piano Concerto no. 12, I was asleep. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">In my dreams, I stood in a dark cavern before a gaping pit. Gray mist creatures
                        churned all
                        around me, whispering rags of smoke that I somehow knew were the spirits of the dead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They tugged at my clothes, trying to pull me back, but I felt compelled to walk
                        forward to the
                        very edge of the chasm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Looking down made me dizzy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The pit yawned so wide and was so completely black, I knew it must be
                        bottomless. Yet I had a
                        feeling that something was trying to rise from the abyss, something huge and evil. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">The voice felt ancient—cold and heavy. It wrapped around me like sheets of
                        lead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">They have misled you, boy, </em>it said. <em

                    <p class="calibre14">A shimmering image hovered over the void: my mother, frozen at the moment she’d

                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to cry out, but my voice wouldn’t work. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">An invisible force pulled me forward. It would drag me into the pit unless I

                    <p class="calibre14">I realized it wasn’t interested in pulling me in. It was using me to pull

                    <p class="calibre13">Someone was shaking me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My eyes opened, and it was daylight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well,” Annabeth said, “the zombie lives.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was trembling from the dream. I could still feel the grip of the chasm
                        monster around my
                        chest. “How long was I asleep?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Long enough for me to cook breakfast.” Annabeth tossed me a bag of
                        nacho-flavored corn chips
                        from Aunty Em’s snack bar. “And Grover went exploring. Look, he found a friend.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My eyes had trouble focusing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was sitting cross-legged on a blanket with something fuzzy in his lap, a
                        dirty,
                        unnaturally pink stuffed animal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No. It wasn’t a stuffed animal. It was a pink poodle. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The poodle yapped at me suspiciously. Grover said, “No, he’s not.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked. “Are you…talking to that thing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The poodle growled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This <em class="calibre5">thing</em>,” Grover warned, “is our ticket west. Be
                        nice to him.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You can talk to animals?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover ignored the question. “Percy, meet Gladiola. Gladiola, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at Annabeth, figuring she’d crack up at this practical joke they were
                        playing on me,
                        but she looked deadly serious. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m not saying hello to a pink poodle,” I said. “Forget it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Annabeth said. “I said hello to the poodle. You say hello to the
                        poodle.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The poodle growled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said hello to the poodle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover explained that he’d come across Gladiola in the woods and they’d struck
                        up a
                        conversation. The poodle had run away from a rich local family, who’d posted a $200 reward for
                        his return.
                        Gladiola didn’t really want to go back to his family, but he was willing to if it meant helping
                        Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How does Gladiola know about the reward?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He read the signs,” Grover said. “Duh.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Of course,” I said. “Silly me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So we turn in Gladiola,” Annabeth explained in her best strategy voice, “we
                        get money, and we
                        buy tickets to Los Angeles. Simple.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about my dream—the whispering voices of the dead, the thing in the
                        chasm, and my
                        mother’s face, shimmering as it dissolved into gold. All that might be waiting for me in the
                        West. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not another bus,” I said warily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” Annabeth agreed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pointed downhill, toward train tracks I hadn’t been able to see last night
                        in the dark.
                        “There’s an Amtrak station half a mile that way. According to Gladiola, the westbound train
                        leaves at noon.”

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">W</span>e spent two days on the Amtrak train, heading west
                        through hills,
                        over rivers, past amber waves of grain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We weren’t attacked once, but I didn’t relax. I felt that we were traveling
                        around in a display
                        case, being watched from above and maybe from below, that something was waiting for the right
                        opportunity. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to keep a low profile because my name and picture were splattered over
                        the front pages
                        of several East Coast newspapers. The <em class="calibre5">Trenton Register-News </em>showed a
                        photo taken by a
                        tourist as I got off the Greyhound bus. I had a wild look in my eyes. My sword was a metallic
                        blur in my hands.
                        It might’ve been a baseball bat or a lacrosse stick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The picture’s caption read: </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson, wanted for questioning in
                            the Long Island
                            disappearance of his mother two weeks ago, is shown here fleeing from the bus where he
                            accosted several
                            elderly female passengers. The bus exploded on an east New Jersey roadside shortly after
                            Jackson fled the
                            scene. Based on eyewitness accounts, police believe the boy may be traveling with two
                            teenage accomplices.
                            His stepfather, Gabe Ugliano, has offered a cash reward for information leading to his
                            capture.</em> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t worry,” Annabeth told me. “Mortal police could never find us.” But she
                        didn’t sound so
                        sure. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The rest of the day I spent alternately pacing the length of the train (because
                        I had a really
                        hard time sitting still) or looking out the windows. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Once, I spotted a family of centaurs galloping across a wheat field, bows at
                        the ready, as they
                        hunted lunch. The little boy centaur, who was the size of a second-grader on a pony, caught my
                        eye and waved. I
                        looked around the passenger car, but nobody else had noticed. The adult riders all had their
                        faces buried in
                        laptop computers or magazines. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Another time, toward evening, I saw something huge moving through the woods. I
                        could’ve sworn
                        it was a lion, except that lions don’t live wild in America, and this thing was the size of a
                        Hummer. Its fur
                        glinted gold in the evening light. Then it leaped through the trees and was gone. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Our reward money for returning Gladiola the poodle had only been enough to
                        purchase tickets as
                        far as Denver. We couldn’t get berths in the sleeper car, so we dozed in our seats. My neck got
                        stiff. I tried
                        not to drool in my sleep, since Annabeth was sitting right next to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover kept snoring and bleating and waking me up. Once, he shuffled around and
                        his fake foot
                        fell off. Annabeth and I had to stick it back on before any of the other passengers noticed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So,” Annabeth asked me, once we’d gotten Grover’s sneaker readjusted. “Who
                        wants your help?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“When you were asleep just now, you mumbled, ‘I won’t help you.’ Who were you
                        dreaming about?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was reluctant to say anything. It was the second time I’d dreamed about the
                        evil voice from
                        the pit. But it bothered me so much I finally told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth was quiet for a long time. “That doesn’t sound like Hades. He always
                        appears on a
                        black throne, and he never laughs.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He offered my mother in trade. Who else could do that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I guess…if he meant, ‘Help me rise from the Underworld.’ If he wants war with
                        the Olympians.
                        But why ask you to bring him the master bolt if he already has it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shook my head, wishing I knew the answer. I thought about what Grover had
                        told me, that the
                        Furies on the bus seemed to have been looking for something. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Where is it? Where? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Maybe Grover sensed my emotions. He snorted in his sleep, muttered something
                        about vegetables,
                        and turned his head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth readjusted his cap so it covered his horns. “Percy, you can’t barter
                        with Hades. You
                        know that, right? He’s deceitful, heartless, and greedy. I don’t care if his Kindly Ones weren’t
                        as aggressive
                        this time—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This time?” I asked. “You mean you’ve run into them before?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her hand crept up to her necklace. She fingered a glazed white bead painted
                        with the image of a
                        pine tree, one of her clay end-of-summer tokens. “Let’s just say I’ve got no love for the Lord
                        of the Dead. You
                        can’t be tempted to make a deal for your mom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What would you do if it was your dad?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s easy,” she said. “I’d leave him to rot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re not serious?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s gray eyes fixed on me. She wore the same expression she’d worn in
                        the woods at camp,
                        the moment she drew her sword against the hellhound. “My dad’s resented me since the day I was
                        born, Percy,” she
                        said. “He never wanted a baby. When he got me, he asked Athena to take me back and raise me on
                        Olympus because
                        he was too busy with his work. She wasn’t happy about that. She told him heroes had to be raised
                        by their mortal
                        parent.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But how…I mean, I guess you weren’t born in a hospital.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I appeared on my father’s doorstep, in a golden cradle, carried down from
                        Olympus by Zephyr
                        the West Wind. You’d think my dad would remember that as a miracle, right? Like, maybe he’d take
                        some digital
                        photos or something. But he always talked about my arrival as if it were the most inconvenient
                        thing that had
                        ever happened to him. When I was five he got married and totally forgot about Athena. He got a
                        ‘regular’ mortal
                        wife, and had two ‘regular’ mortal kids, and tried to pretend I didn’t exist.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared out the train window. The lights of a sleeping town were drifting by.
                        I wanted to make
                        Annabeth feel better, but I didn’t know how. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My mom married a really awful guy,” I told her. “Grover said she did it to
                        protect me, to hide
                        me in the scent of a human family. Maybe that’s what your dad was thinking.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth kept worrying at her necklace. She was pinching the gold college ring
                        that hung with
                        the beads. It occurred to me that the ring must be her father’s. I wondered why she wore it if
                        she hated him so
                        much. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“He doesn’t care about me,” she said. “His wife—my stepmom—treated me like a
                        freak. She
                        wouldn’t let me play with her children. My dad went along with her. Whenever something dangerous
                        happened—you
                        know, something with monsters—they would both look at me resentfully, like, ‘How dare you put
                        our family at
                        risk.’ Finally, I took the hint. I wasn’t wanted. I ran away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How old were you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Same age as when I started camp. Seven.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But…you couldn’t have gotten all the way to Half-Blood Hill by yourself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not alone, no. Athena watched over me, guided me toward help. I made a couple
                        of unexpected
                        friends who took care of me, for a short time, anyway.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I wanted to ask what happened, but Annabeth seemed lost in sad memories. So I
                        listened to the
                        sound of Grover snoring and gazed out the train windows as the dark fields of Ohio raced by.

                    <p class="calibre13">Toward the end of our second day on the train, June 13, eight days before the
                        summer solstice,
                        we passed through some golden hills and over the Mississippi River into St. Louis. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth craned her neck to see the Gateway Arch, which looked to me like a
                        huge shopping bag
                        handle stuck on the city. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I want to do that,” she sighed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Build something like that. You ever see the Parthenon, Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Only in pictures.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Someday, I’m going to see it in person. I’m going to build the greatest
                        monument to the gods,
                        ever. Something that’ll last a thousand years.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I laughed. “You? An architect?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I don’t know why, but I found it funny. Just the idea of Annabeth trying to sit
                        quietly and
                        draw all day. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her cheeks flushed. “Yes, an architect. Athena expects her children to create
                        things, not just
                        tear them down, like a certain god of earthquakes I could mention.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I watched the churning brown water of the Mississippi below. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sorry,” Annabeth said. “That was mean.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Can’t we work together a little?” I pleaded. “I mean, didn’t Athena and
                        Poseidon ever
                        cooperate?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth had to think about it. “I guess…the chariot,” she said tentatively.
                        “My mom invented
                        it, but Poseidon created horses out of the crests of waves. So they had to work together to make
                        it complete.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then we can cooperate, too. Right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We rode into the city, Annabeth watching as the Arch disappeared behind a
                        hotel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I suppose,” she said at last. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We pulled into the Amtrak station downtown. The intercom told us we’d have a
                        three-hour layover
                        before departing for Denver. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover stretched. Before he was even fully awake, he said, “Food.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on, goat boy,” Annabeth said. “Sightseeing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sightseeing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Gateway Arch,” she said. “This may be my only chance to ride to the top.
                        Are you coming or
                        not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and I exchanged looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to say no, but I figured that if Annabeth was going, we couldn’t very
                        well let her go
                        alone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Grover shrugged. “As long as there’s a snack bar without monsters.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The Arch was about a mile from the train station. Late in the day the lines to
                        get in weren’t
                        that long. We threaded our way through the underground museum, looking at covered wagons and
                        other junk from the
                        1800s. It wasn’t all that thrilling, but Annabeth kept telling us interesting facts about how
                        the Arch was
                        built, and Grover kept passing me jelly beans, so I was okay. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I kept looking around, though, at the other people in line. “You smell
                        anything?” I murmured to
                        Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He took his nose out of the jelly-bean bag long enough to sniff. “Underground,”
                        he said
                        distastefully. “Underground air always smells like monsters. Probably doesn’t mean anything.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But something felt wrong to me. I had a feeling we shouldn’t be here. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Guys,” I said. “You know the gods’ symbols of power?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth had been in the middle of reading about the construction equipment
                        used to build the
                        Arch, but she looked over. “Yeah?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, Hade—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover cleared his throat. “We’re in a public place.…You mean, our friend
                        downstairs?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um, right,” I said. “Our friend <em class="calibre5">way </em>downstairs.
                        Doesn’t he have a
                        hat like Annabeth’s?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean the Helm of Darkness,” Annabeth said. “Yeah, that’s his symbol of
                        power. I saw it
                        next to his seat during the winter solstice council meeting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He was there?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She nodded. “It’s the only time he’s allowed to visit Olympus—the darkest day
                        of the year. But
                        his helm is a lot more powerful than my invisibility hat, if what I’ve heard is true.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It allows him to become darkness,” Grover confirmed. “He can melt into shadow
                        or pass through
                        walls. He can’t be touched, or seen, or heard. And he can radiate fear so intense it can drive
                        you insane or
                        stop your heart. Why do you think all rational creatures fear the dark?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But then…how do we know he’s not here right now, watching us?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and Grover exchanged looks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We don’t,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thanks, that makes me feel a lot better,” I said. “Got any blue jelly beans
                        left?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d almost mastered my jumpy nerves when I saw the tiny little elevator car we
                        were going to
                        ride to the top of the Arch, and I knew I was in trouble. I hate confined places. They make me
                        nuts. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We got shoehorned into the car with this big fat lady and her dog, a Chihuahua
                        with a
                        rhinestone collar. I figured maybe the dog was a seeing-eye Chihuahua, because none of the
                        guards said a word
                        about it. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/13-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We started going up, inside the Arch. I’d never been in an elevator that went
                        in a curve, and
                        my stomach wasn’t too happy about it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No parents?” the fat lady asked us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She had beady eyes; pointy, coffee-stained teeth; a floppy denim hat, and a
                        denim dress that
                        bulged so much, she looked like a blue-jean blimp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They’re below,” Annabeth told her. “Scared of heights.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, the poor darlings.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Chihuahua growled. The woman said, “Now, now, sonny. Behave.” The dog had
                        beady eyes like
                        its owner, intelligent and vicious. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “Sonny. Is that his name?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” the lady told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She smiled, as if that cleared everything up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At the top of the Arch, the observation deck reminded me of a tin can with
                        carpeting. Rows of
                        tiny windows looked out over the city on one side and the river on the other. The view was okay,
                        but if there’s
                        anything I like less than a confined space, it’s a confined space six hundred feet in the air. I
                        was ready to go
                        pretty quick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth kept talking about structural supports, and how she would’ve made the
                        windows bigger,
                        and designed a see-through floor. She probably could’ve stayed up there for hours, but luckily
                        for me the park
                        ranger announced that the observation deck would be closing in a few minutes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I steered Grover and Annabeth toward the exit, loaded them into the elevator,
                        and I was about
                        to get in myself when I realized there were already two other tourists inside. No room for me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The park ranger said, “Next car, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll get out,” Annabeth said. “We’ll wait with you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But that was going to mess everybody up and take even more time, so I said,
                        “Naw, it’s okay.
                        I’ll see you guys at the bottom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and Annabeth both looked nervous, but they let the elevator door slide
                        shut. Their car
                        disappeared down the ramp. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Now the only people left on the observation deck were me, a little boy with his
                        parents, the
                        park ranger, and the fat lady with her Chihuahua. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I smiled uneasily at the fat lady. She smiled back, her forked tongue
                        flickering between her
                        teeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Wait a minute. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Forked tongue? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I could decide if I’d really seen that, her Chihuahua jumped down and
                        started yapping at
                        me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now, now, sonny,” the lady said. “Does this look like a good time? We have all
                        these nice
                        people here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Doggie!” said the little boy. “Look, a doggie!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His parents pulled him back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Chihuahua bared his teeth at me, foam dripping from his black lips. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, son,” the fat lady sighed. “If you insist.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ice started forming in my stomach. “Um, did you just call that Chihuahua your
                        son?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">Chimera</em>, dear,” the fat lady corrected. “Not a
                        Chihuahua. It’s an
                        easy mistake to make.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She rolled up her denim sleeves, revealing that the skin of her arms was scaly
                        and green. When
                        she smiled, I saw that her teeth were fangs. The pupils of her eyes were sideways slits, like a
                        reptile’s. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Chihuahua barked louder, and with each bark, it grew. First to the size of
                        a Doberman, then
                        to a lion. The bark became a roar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The little boy screamed. His parents pulled him back toward the exit, straight
                        into the park
                        ranger, who stood, paralyzed, gaping at the monster. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Chimera was now so tall its back rubbed against the roof. It had the head
                        of a lion with a
                        blood-caked mane, the body and hooves of a giant goat, and a serpent for a tail, a ten-foot-long
                        diamondback
                        growing right out of its shaggy behind. The rhinestone dog collar still hung around its neck,
                        and the
                        plate-sized dog tag was now easy to read: <small class="calibre4">CHIMERA—RABID</small>, <small
                            class="calibre4">FIRE-BREATHING</small>, <small class="calibre4">POISONOUS—IF FOUND</small>,
                        <small class="calibre4">PLEASE CALL TARTARUS—EXT. 954.</small>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I realized I hadn’t even uncapped my sword. My hands were numb. I was ten feet
                        away from the
                        Chimera’s bloody maw, and I knew that as soon as I moved, the creature would lunge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The snake lady made a hissing noise that might’ve been laughter. “Be honored,
                        Percy Jackson.
                        Lord Zeus rarely allows me to test a hero with one of my brood. For I am the Mother of Monsters,
                        the terrible
                        Echidna!” </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at her. All I could think to say was: “Isn’t that a kind of anteater?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She howled, her reptilian face turning brown and green with rage. “I hate it
                        when people say
                        that! I hate Australia! Naming that ridiculous animal after me. For that, Percy Jackson, my son
                        shall destroy
                        you!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Chimera charged, its lion teeth gnashing. I managed to leap aside and dodge
                        the bite. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I ended up next to the family and the park ranger, who were all screaming now,
                        trying to pry
                        open the emergency exit doors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t let them get hurt. I uncapped my sword, ran to the other side of the
                        deck, and
                        yelled, “Hey, Chihuahua!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Chimera turned faster than I would’ve thought possible. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I could swing my sword, it opened its mouth, emitting a stench like the
                        world’s largest
                        barbecue pit, and shot a column of flame straight at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I dove through the explosion. The carpet burst into flames; the heat was so
                        intense, it nearly
                        seared off my eyebrows. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Where I had been standing a moment before was a ragged hole in the side of the
                        Arch, with
                        melted metal steaming around the edges. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Great, I thought. We just blowtorched a national monument. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Riptide was now a shining bronze blade in my hands, and as the Chimera turned,
                        I slashed at its
                        neck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That was my fatal mistake. The blade sparked harmlessly off the dog collar. I
                        tried to regain
                        my balance, but I was so worried about defending myself against the fiery lion’s mouth, I
                        completely forgot
                        about the serpent tail until it whipped around and sank its fangs into my calf. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My whole leg was on fire. I tried to jab Riptide into the Chimera’s mouth, but
                        the serpent tail
                        wrapped around my ankles and pulled me off balance, and my blade flew out of my hand, spinning
                        out of the hole
                        in the Arch and down toward the Mississippi River. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed to get to my feet, but I knew I had lost. I was weaponless. I could
                        feel deadly
                        poison racing up to my chest. I remembered Chiron saying that Anaklusmos would always return to
                        me, but there
                        was no pen in my pocket. Maybe it had fallen too far away. Maybe it only returned when it was in
                        pen form. I
                        didn’t know, and I wasn’t going to live long enough to figure it out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I backed into the hole in the wall. The Chimera advanced, growling, smoke
                        curling from its
                        lips. The snake lady, Echidna, cackled. “They don’t make heroes like they used to, eh, son?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The monster growled. It seemed in no hurry to finish me off now that I was
                        beaten. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I glanced at the park ranger and the family. The little boy was hiding behind
                        his father’s
                        legs. I had to protect these people. I couldn’t just…die. I tried to think, but my whole body
                        was on fire. My
                        head felt dizzy. I had no sword. I was facing a massive, fire-breathing monster and its mother.
                        And I was
                        scared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was no place else to go, so I stepped to the edge of the hole. Far, far
                        below, the river
                        glittered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">If I died, would the monsters go away? Would they leave the humans alone? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If you are the son of Poseidon,” Echidna hissed, “you would not fear water.
                        Jump, Percy
                        Jackson. Show me that water will not harm you. Jump and retrieve your sword. Prove your
                        bloodline.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Yeah, right, I thought. I’d read somewhere that jumping into water from a
                        couple of stories up
                        was like jumping onto solid asphalt. From here, I’d splatter on impact. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Chimera’s mouth glowed red, heating up for another blast. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You have no faith,” Echidna told me. “You do not trust the gods. I cannot
                        blame you, little
                        coward. Better you die now. The gods are faithless. The poison is in your heart.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She was right: I was dying. I could feel my breath slowing down. Nobody could
                        save me, not even
                        the gods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I backed up and looked down at the water. I remembered the warm glow of my
                        father’s smile when
                        I was a baby. He must have seen me. He must have visited me when I was in my cradle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I remembered the swirling green trident that had appeared above my head the
                        night of capture
                        the flag, when Poseidon had claimed me as his son. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But this wasn’t the sea. This was the Mississippi, dead center of the USA.
                        There was no Sea God
                        here. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Die, faithless one,” Echidna rasped, and the Chimera sent a column of flame
                        toward my face.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Father, help me,” I prayed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned and jumped. My clothes on fire, poison coursing through my veins, I
                        plummeted toward
                        the river. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">I</span>’d love to tell you I had some deep revelation on
                        my way down,
                        that I came to terms with my own mortality, laughed in the face of death, et cetera. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The truth? My only thought was: Aaaaggghhhhh! </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The river raced toward me at the speed of a truck. Wind ripped the breath from
                        my lungs.
                        Steeples and skyscrapers and bridges tumbled in and out of my vision. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And then: <em class="calibre5">Flaaa-boooom! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A whiteout of bubbles. I sank through the murk, sure that I was about to end up
                        embedded in a
                        hundred feet of mud and lost forever. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But my impact with the water hadn’t hurt. I was falling slowly now, bubbles
                        trickling up
                        through my fingers. I settled on the river bottom soundlessly. A catfish the size of my
                        stepfather lurched away
                        into the gloom. Clouds of silt and disgusting garbage—beer bottles, old shoes, plastic
                        bags—swirled up all
                        around me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At that point, I realized a few things: first, I had not been flattened into a
                        pancake. I had
                        not been barbecued. I couldn’t even feel the Chimera poison boiling in my veins anymore. I was
                        alive, which was
                        good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Second realization: I wasn’t wet. I mean, I could feel the coolness of the
                        water. I could see
                        where the fire on my clothes had been quenched. But when I touched my own shirt, it felt
                        perfectly dry. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at the garbage floating by and snatched an old cigarette lighter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No way, I thought. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I flicked the lighter. It sparked. A tiny flame appeared, right there at the
                        bottom of the
                        Mississippi. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I grabbed a soggy hamburger wrapper out of the current and immediately the
                        paper turned dry. I
                        lit it with no problem. As soon as I let it go, the flames sputtered out. The wrapper turned
                        back into a slimy
                        rag. Weird. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But the strangest thought occurred to me only last: I was breathing. I was
                        underwater, and I
                        was breathing normally. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stood up, thigh-deep in mud. My legs felt shaky. My hands trembled. I
                        should’ve been dead.
                        The fact that I wasn’t seemed like…well, a miracle. I imagined a woman’s voice, a voice that
                        sounded a bit like
                        my mother: <em class="calibre5">Percy, what do you say? </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um…thanks.” Underwater, I sounded like I did on recordings, like a much older
                        kid. “Thank
                        you…Father.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No response. Just the dark drift of garbage downriver, the enormous catfish
                        gliding by, the
                        flash of sunset on the water’s surface far above, turning everything the color of butterscotch.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Why had Poseidon saved me? The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I
                        felt. So I’d gotten
                        lucky a few times before. Against a thing like the Chimera, I had never stood a chance. Those
                        poor people in the
                        Arch were probably toast. I couldn’t protect them. I was no hero. Maybe I should just stay down
                        here with the
                        catfish, join the bottom feeders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Fump-fump-fump. </em>A riverboat’s paddlewheel churned
                        above me, swirling
                        the silt around. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There, not five feet in front of me, was my sword, its gleaming bronze hilt
                        sticking up in the
                        mud. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I heard that woman’s voice again: <em class="calibre5">Percy, take the sword.
                            Your father
                            believes in you. </em>This time, I knew the voice wasn’t in my head. I wasn’t imagining it.
                        Her words seemed
                        to come from everywhere, rippling through the water like dolphin sonar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Where are you?” I called aloud. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then, through the gloom, I saw her—a woman the color of the water, a ghost in
                        the current,
                        floating just above the sword. She had long billowing hair, and her eyes, barely visible, were
                        green like mine.
                    </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">A lump formed in my throat. I said, “Mom?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">No, child, only a messenger, though your mother’s fate is
                            not as hopeless as
                            you believe. Go to
                            the beach in Santa Monica.</em> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">It is your father’s will. Before you descend into the
                            Underworld, you must go
                            to Santa Monica.
                            Please, Percy, I cannot stay long. The river here is too foul for my presence. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But…” I was sure this woman was my mother, or a vision of her, anyway.
                        “Who—how did you—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was so much I wanted to ask, the words jammed up in my throat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">I cannot stay, brave one, </em>the woman said. She reached
                        out, and I felt
                        the current brush my face like a caress. <em class="calibre5">You must go to Santa Monica! And,
                            Percy, do not
                            trust the gifts.…</em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her voice faded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Gifts?” I asked. “What gifts? Wait!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She made one more attempt to speak, but the sound was gone. Her image melted
                        away. If it was my
                        mother, I had lost her again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt like drowning myself. The only problem: I was immune to drowning. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Your father believes in you</em>, she had said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She’d also called me brave…unless she was talking to the catfish. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I waded toward Riptide and grabbed it by the hilt. The Chimera might still be
                        up there with its
                        snaky, fat mother, waiting to finish me off. At the very least, the mortal police would be
                        arriving, trying to
                        figure out who had blown a hole in the Arch. If they found me, they’d have some questions. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I capped my sword, stuck the ballpoint pen in my pocket. “Thank you, Father,” I
                        said again to
                        the dark water. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Then I kicked up through the muck and swam for the surface. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I came ashore next to a floating McDonald’s. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A block away, every emergency vehicle in St. Louis was surrounding the Arch.
                        Police helicopters
                        circled overhead. The crowd of onlookers reminded me of Times Square on New Year’s Eve. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A little girl said, “Mama! That boy walked out of the river.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s nice, dear,” her mother said, craning her neck to watch the ambulances.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But he’s dry!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s nice, dear.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A news lady was talking for the camera: “Probably not a terrorist attack, we’re
                        told, but it’s
                        still very early in the investigation. The damage, as you can see, is very serious. We’re trying
                        to get to some
                        of the survivors, to question them about eyewitness reports of someone falling from the Arch.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Survivors. </em>I felt a surge of relief. Maybe the park
                        ranger and that
                        family made it out safely. I hoped Annabeth and Grover were okay. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to push through the crowd to see what was going on inside the police
                        line. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“…an adolescent boy,” another reporter was saying. “Channel Five has learned
                        that surveillance
                        cameras show an adolescent boy going wild on the observation deck, somehow setting off this
                        freak explosion.
                        Hard to believe, John, but that’s what we’re hearing. Again, no confirmed fatalities…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I backed away, trying to keep my head down. I had to go a long way around the
                        police perimeter.
                        Uniformed officers and news reporters were everywhere. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d almost lost hope of ever finding Annabeth and Grover when a familiar voice
                        bleated,
                        “Perrr-cy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned and got tackled by Grover’s bear hug—or goat hug. He said, “We thought
                        you’d gone to
                        Hades the hard way!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth stood behind him, trying to look angry, but even she seemed relieved
                        to see me. “We
                        can’t leave you alone for five minutes! What happened?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I sort of fell.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy! Six hundred and thirty feet?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind us, a cop shouted, “Gangway!” The crowd parted, and a couple of
                        paramedics hustled out,
                        rolling a woman on a stretcher. I recognized her immediately as the mother of the little boy
                        who’d been on the
                        observation deck. She was saying, “And then this huge dog, this huge fire-breathing Chihuahua—”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay, ma’am,” the paramedic said. “Just calm down. Your family is fine. The
                        medication is
                        starting to kick in.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m not crazy! This boy jumped out of the hole and the monster disappeared.”
                        Then she saw me.
                        “There he is! That’s the boy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned quickly and pulled Annabeth and Grover after me. We disappeared into
                        the crowd. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s going on?” Annabeth demanded. “Was she talking about the Chihuahua on
                        the elevator?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told them the whole story of the Chimera, Echidna, my high-dive act, and the
                        underwater
                        lady’s message. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whoa,” said Grover. “We’ve got to get you to Santa Monica! You can’t ignore a
                        summons from
                        your dad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before Annabeth could respond, we passed another reporter doing a news break,
                        and I almost
                        froze in my tracks when he said, “Percy Jackson. That’s right, Dan. Channel Twelve has learned
                        that the boy who
                        may have caused this explosion fits the description of a young man wanted by authorities for a
                        serious New
                        Jersey bus accident three days ago. <em class="calibre5">And </em>the boy is believed to be
                        traveling west. For
                        our viewers at home, here is a photo of Percy Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We ducked around the news van and slipped into an alley. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“First things first,” I told Grover. “We’ve got to get out of town!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Somehow, we made it back to the Amtrak station without getting spotted. We got
                        on board the
                        train just before it pulled out for Denver. The train trundled west as darkness fell, police
                        lights still
                        pulsing against the St. Louis skyline behind us. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">T</span>he next afternoon, June 14, seven days before the
                        solstice, our
                        train rolled into Denver. We hadn’t eaten since the night before in the dining car, somewhere in
                        Kansas. We
                        hadn’t taken a shower since Half-Blood Hill, and I was sure that was obvious. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Let’s try to contact Chiron,” Annabeth said. “I want to tell him about your
                        talk with the
                        river spirit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We can’t use phones, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m not talking about phones.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We wandered through downtown for about half an hour, though I wasn’t sure what
                        Annabeth was
                        looking for. The air was dry and hot, which felt weird after the humidity of St. Louis.
                        Everywhere we turned,
                        the Rocky Mountains seemed to be staring at me, like a tidal wave about to crash into the city.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally we found an empty do-it-yourself car wash. We veered toward the stall
                        farthest from the
                        street, keeping our eyes open for patrol cars. We were three adolescents hanging out at a car
                        wash without a
                        car; any cop worth his doughnuts would figure we were up to no good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What exactly are we doing?” I asked, as Grover took out the spray gun. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s seventy-five cents,” he grumbled. “I’ve only got two quarters left.
                        Annabeth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t look at me,” she said. “The dining car wiped me out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I fished out my last bit of change and passed Grover a quarter, which left me
                        two nickels and
                        one drachma from Medusa’s place. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Excellent,” Grover said. “We could do it with a spray bottle, of course, but
                        the connection
                        isn’t as good, and my arm gets tired of pumping.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What are you talking about?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He fed in the quarters and set the knob to <small class="calibre4">FINE
                            MIST</small>.
                        “I-M’ing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Instant messaging?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">Iris</em>-messaging,” Annabeth corrected. “The rainbow
                        goddess Iris
                        carries messages for the gods. If you know how to ask, and she’s not too busy, she’ll do the
                        same for
                        half-bloods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You summon the goddess with a spray gun?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover pointed the nozzle in the air and water hissed out in a thick white
                        mist. “Unless you
                        know an easier way to make a rainbow.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Sure enough, late afternoon light filtered through the vapor and broke into
                        colors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth held her palm out to me. “Drachma, please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I handed it over. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She raised the coin over her head. “O goddess, accept our offering.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She threw the drachma into the rainbow. It disappeared in a golden shimmer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Half-Blood Hill,” Annabeth requested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a moment, nothing happened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I was looking through the mist at strawberry fields, and the Long Island
                        Sound in the
                        distance. We seemed to be on the porch of the Big House. Standing with his back to us at the
                        railing was a
                        sandy-haired guy in shorts and an orange tank top. He was holding a bronze sword and seemed to
                        be staring
                        intently at something down in the meadow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Luke!” I called. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He turned, eyes wide. I could swear he was standing three feet in front of me
                        through a screen
                        of mist, except I could only see the part of him that appeared in the rainbow. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” His scarred face broke into a grin. “Is that Annabeth, too? Thank the
                        gods! Are you
                        guys okay?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re…uh…fine,” Annabeth stammered. She was madly straightening her dirty
                        T-shirt, trying to
                        comb the loose hair out of her face. “We thought—Chiron—I mean—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s down at the cabins.” Luke’s smile faded. “We’re having some issues with
                        the campers.
                        Listen, is everything cool with you? Is Grover all right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m right here,” Grover called. He held the nozzle out to one side and stepped
                        into Luke’s
                        line of vision. “What kind of issues?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Just then a big Lincoln Continental pulled into the car wash with its stereo
                        turned to maximum
                        hip-hop. As the car slid into the next stall, the bass from the subwoofers vibrated so much, it
                        shook the
                        pavement. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chiron had to—what’s that noise?” Luke yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll take care of it!” Annabeth yelled back, looking very relieved to have an
                        excuse to get
                        out of sight. “Grover, come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” Grover said. “But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Give Percy the nozzle and come on!” she ordered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover muttered something about girls being harder to understand than the
                        Oracle at Delphi,
                        then he handed me the spray gun and followed Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I readjusted the hose so I could keep the rainbow going and still see Luke.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Chiron had to break up a fight,” Luke shouted to me over the music. “Things
                        are pretty tense
                        here, Percy. Word leaked out about the Zeus–Poseidon standoff. We’re still not sure how—probably
                        the same
                        scumbag who summoned the hellhound. Now the campers are starting to take sides. It’s shaping up
                        like the Trojan
                        War all over again. Aphrodite, Ares, and Apollo are backing Poseidon, more or less. Athena is
                        backing Zeus.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shuddered to think that Clarisse’s cabin would ever be on my dad’s side for
                        anything. In the
                        next stall, I heard Annabeth and some guy arguing with each other, then the music’s volume
                        decreased
                        drastically. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So what’s your status?” Luke asked me. “Chiron will be sorry he missed you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told him pretty much everything, including my dreams. It felt so good to see
                        him, to feel
                        like I was back at camp even for a few minutes, that I didn’t realize how long I had talked
                        until the beeper
                        went off on the spray machine, and I realized I only had one more minute before the water shut
                        off. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I wish I could be there,” Luke told me. “We can’t help much from here, I’m
                        afraid, but
                        listen…it had to be Hades who took the master bolt. He was there at Olympus at the winter
                        solstice. I was
                        chaperoning a field trip and we saw him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But Chiron said the gods can’t take each other’s magic items directly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s true,” Luke said, looking troubled. “Still…Hades has the helm of
                        darkness. How could
                        anybody else sneak into the throne room and steal the master bolt? You’d have to be invisible.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We were both silent, until Luke seemed to realize what he’d said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, hey,” he protested. “I didn’t mean Annabeth. She and I have known each
                        other forever. She
                        would never…I mean, she’s like a little sister to me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wondered if Annabeth would like that description. In the stall next to us,
                        the music stopped
                        completely. A man screamed in terror, car doors slammed, and the Lincoln peeled out of the car
                        wash. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’d better go see what that was,” Luke said. “Listen, are you wearing the
                        flying shoes? I’ll
                        feel better if I know they’ve done you some good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh…uh, yeah!” I tried not to sound like a guilty liar. “Yeah, they’ve come in
                        handy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Really?” He grinned. “They fit and everything?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The water shut off. The mist started to evaporate. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, take care of yourself out there in Denver,” Luke called, his voice
                        getting fainter. “And
                        tell Grover it’ll be better this time! Nobody will get turned into a pine tree if he just—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But the mist was gone, and Luke’s image faded to nothing. I was alone in a wet,
                        empty car wash
                        stall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and Grover came around the corner, laughing, but stopped when they saw
                        my face.
                        Annabeth’s smile faded. “What happened, Percy? What did Luke say?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not much,” I lied, my stomach feeling as empty as a Big Three cabin. “Come on,
                        let’s find some
                        dinner.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A few minutes later, we were sitting at a booth in a gleaming chrome diner. All
                        around us,
                        families were eating burgers and drinking malts and sodas. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally the waitress came over. She raised her eyebrow skeptically. “Well?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “We, um, want to order dinner.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You kids have money to pay for it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover’s lower lip quivered. I was afraid he would start bleating, or worse,
                        start eating the
                        linoleum. Annabeth looked ready to pass out from hunger. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was trying to think up a sob story for the waitress when a rumble shook the
                        whole building; a
                        motorcycle the size of a baby elephant had pulled up to the curb. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All conversation in the diner stopped. The motorcycle’s headlight glared red.
                        Its gas tank had
                        flames painted on it, and a shotgun holster riveted to either side, complete with shotguns. The
                        seat was
                        leather—but leather that looked like…well, Caucasian human skin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The guy on the bike would’ve made pro wrestlers run for Mama. He was dressed in
                        a red muscle
                        shirt and black jeans and a black leather duster, with a hunting knife strapped to his thigh. He
                        wore red
                        wraparound shades, and he had the cruelest, most brutal face I’d ever seen—handsome, I guess,
                        but wicked—with an
                        oily black crew cut and cheeks that were scarred from many, many fights. The weird thing was, I
                        felt like I’d
                        seen his face somewhere before. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/15-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">As he walked into the diner, a hot, dry wind blew through the place. All the
                        people rose, as if
                        they were hypnotized, but the biker waved his hand dismissively and they all sat down again.
                        Everybody went back
                        to their conversations. The waitress blinked, as if somebody had just pressed the rewind button
                        on her brain.
                        She asked us again, “You kids have money to pay for it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The biker said, “It’s on me.” He slid into our booth, which was way too small
                        for him, and
                        crowded Annabeth against the window. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked up at the waitress, who was gaping at him, and said, “Are you still
                        here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pointed at her, and she stiffened. She turned as if she’d been spun around,
                        then marched
                        back toward the kitchen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The biker looked at me. I couldn’t see his eyes behind the red shades, but bad
                        feelings started
                        boiling in my stomach. Anger, resentment, bitterness. I wanted to hit a wall. I wanted to pick a
                        fight with
                        somebody. Who did this guy think he was? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gave me a wicked grin. “So you’re old Seaweed’s kid, huh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I should’ve been surprised, or scared, but instead I felt like I was looking at
                        my stepdad,
                        Gabe. I wanted to rip this guy’s head off. “What’s it to you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s eyes flashed me a warning. “Percy, this is—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The biker raised his hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“S’okay,” he said. “I don’t mind a little attitude. Long as you remember who’s
                        the boss. You
                        know who I am, little cousin?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then it struck me why this guy looked familiar. He had the same vicious sneer
                        as some of the
                        kids at Camp Half-Blood, the ones from cabin five. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re Clarisse’s dad,” I said. “Ares, god of war.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares grinned and took off his shades. Where his eyes should’ve been, there was
                        only fire, empty
                        sockets glowing with miniature nuclear explosions. “That’s right, punk. I heard you broke
                        Clarisse’s spear.”
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/15-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“She was asking for it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Probably. That’s cool. I don’t fight my kids’ fights, you know? What I’m here
                        for—I heard you
                        were in town. I got a little proposition for you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The waitress came back with heaping trays of food—cheeseburgers, fries, onion
                        rings, and
                        chocolate shakes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares handed her a few gold drachmas. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked nervously at the coins. “But, these aren’t…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares pulled out his huge knife and started cleaning his fingernails. “Problem,
                        sweetheart?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The waitress swallowed, then left with the gold. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You can’t do that,” I told Ares. “You can’t just threaten people with a
                        knife.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares laughed. “Are you kidding? I love this country. Best place since Sparta.
                        Don’t you carry a
                        weapon, punk? You should. Dangerous world out there. Which brings me to my proposition. I need
                        you to do me a
                        favor.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What favor could I do for a god?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Something a god doesn’t have time to do himself. It’s nothing much. I left my
                        shield at an
                        abandoned water park here in town. I was going on a little…date with my girlfriend. We were
                        interrupted. I left
                        my shield behind. I want you to fetch it for me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why don’t you go back and get it yourself ?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The fire in his eye sockets glowed a little hotter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why don’t I turn you into a prairie dog and run you over with my Harley?
                        Because I don’t feel
                        like it. A god is giving you an opportunity to prove yourself, Percy Jackson. Will you prove
                        yourself a coward?”
                        He leaned forward. “Or maybe you only fight when there’s a river to dive into, so your daddy can
                        protect you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to punch this guy, but somehow, I knew he was waiting for that. Ares’s
                        power was
                        causing my anger. He’d love it if I attacked. I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re not interested,” I said. “We’ve already got a quest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares’s fiery eyes made me see things I didn’t want to see—blood and smoke and
                        corpses on the
                        battlefield. “I know all about your quest, punk. When that <em class="calibre5">item </em>was
                        first stolen, Zeus
                        sent his best out looking for it: Apollo, Athena, Artemis, and me, naturally. If I couldn’t
                        sniff out a weapon
                        that powerful…” He licked his lips, as if the very thought of the master bolt made him hungry.
                        “Well…if I
                        couldn’t find it, you got no hope. Nevertheless, I’m trying to give you the benefit of the
                        doubt. Your dad and I
                        go way back. After all, I’m the one who told him my suspicions about old Corpse Breath.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You told him Hades stole the bolt?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sure. Framing somebody to start a war. Oldest trick in the book. I recognized
                        it immediately.
                        In a way, you got me to thank for your little quest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thanks,” I grumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, I’m a generous guy. Just do my little job, and I’ll help you on your way.
                        I’ll arrange a
                        ride west for you and your friends.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re doing fine on our own.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, right. No money. No wheels. No clue what you’re up against. Help me out,
                        and maybe I’ll
                        tell you something you need to know. Something about your mom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“My mom?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He grinned. “That got your attention. The water park is a mile west on Delancy.
                        You can’t miss
                        it. Look for the Tunnel of Love ride.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What interrupted your date?” I asked. “Something scare you off?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares bared his teeth, but I’d seen his threatening look before on Clarisse.
                        There was something
                        false about it, almost like he was nervous. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re lucky you met me, punk, and not one of the other Olympians. They’re not
                        as forgiving of
                        rudeness as I am. I’ll meet you back here when you’re done. Don’t disappoint me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After that I must have fainted, or fallen into a trance, because when I opened
                        my eyes again,
                        Ares was gone. I might’ve thought the conversation had been a dream, but Annabeth and Grover’s
                        expressions told
                        me otherwise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not good,” Grover said. “Ares sought you out, Percy. This is not good.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared out the window. The motorcycle had disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Did Ares really know something about my mom, or was he just playing with me?
                        Now that he was
                        gone, all the anger had drained out of me. I realized Ares must love to mess with people’s
                        emotions. That was
                        his power—cranking up the passions so badly, they clouded your ability to think. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s probably some kind of trick,” I said. “Forget Ares. Let’s just go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We can’t,” Annabeth said. “Look, I hate Ares as much as anybody, but you don’t
                        ignore the gods
                        unless you want serious bad fortune. He wasn’t kidding about turning you into a rodent.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked down at my cheeseburger, which suddenly didn’t seem so appetizing.
                        “Why does he need
                        us?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe it’s a problem that requires brains,” Annabeth said. “Ares has strength.
                        That’s all he
                        has. Even strength has to bow to wisdom sometimes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But this water park…he acted almost scared. What would make a war god run away
                        like that?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and Grover glanced nervously at each other. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Annabeth said, “I’m afraid we’ll have to find out.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The sun was sinking behind the mountains by the time we found the water park.
                        Judging from the
                        sign, it once had been called <small class="calibre4">WATERLAND</small>, but now some of the
                        letters were
                        smashed out, so it read <small class="calibre4">WAT R A D</small>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The main gate was padlocked and topped with barbed wire. Inside, huge dry
                        waterslides and tubes
                        and pipes curled everywhere, leading to empty pools. Old tickets and advertisements fluttered
                        around the
                        asphalt. With night coming on, the place looked sad and creepy. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/15-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“If Ares brings his girlfriend here for a date,” I said, staring up at the
                        barbed wire, “I’d
                        hate to see what she looks like.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Annabeth warned. “Be more respectful.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why? I thought you hated Ares.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s still a god. And his girlfriend is very temperamental.”</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You don’t want to insult her looks,” Grover added. “Who is she? Echidna?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, Aphrodite,” Grover said, a little dreamily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Goddess of love.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I thought she was married to somebody,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hephaestus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s your point?” he asked. “Oh.” I suddenly felt the need to change the
                        subject. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So how do we get in?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“Maia!” </em>Grover’s shoes sprouted wings. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He flew over the fence, did an unintended somersault in midair, then stumbled
                        to a landing on
                        the opposite side. He dusted off his jeans, as if he’d planned the whole thing. “You guys
                        coming?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and I had to climb the old-fashioned way, holding down the barbed wire
                        for each other
                        as we crawled over the top. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The shadows grew long as we walked through the park, checking out the
                        attractions. There was
                        Ankle Biter Island, Head Over Wedgie, and Dude, Where’s My Swimsuit? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No monsters came to get us. Nothing made the slightest noise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We found a souvenir shop that had been left open. Merchandise still lined the
                        shelves: snow
                        globes, pencils, postcards, and racks of—</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Clothes,” Annabeth said. “Fresh clothes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” I said. “But you can’t just—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Watch me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She snatched an entire row of stuff off the racks and disappeared into the
                        changing room. A few
                        minutes later she came out in Waterland flower-print shorts, a big red Waterland T-shirt, and
                        commemorative
                        Waterland surf shoes. A Waterland backpack was slung over her shoulder, obviously stuffed with
                        more goodies.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/15-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“What the heck.” Grover shrugged. Soon, all three of us were decked out like
                        walking
                        advertisements for the defunct theme park. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We continued searching for the Tunnel of Love. I got the feeling that the whole
                        park was
                        holding its breath. “So Ares and Aphrodite,” I said, to keep my mind off the growing dark, “they
                        have a thing
                        going?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s old gossip, Percy,” Annabeth told me. “Three-thousand-year-old gossip.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What about Aphrodite’s husband?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, you know,” she said. “Hephaestus. The blacksmith. He was crippled when
                        he was a baby,
                        thrown off Mount Olympus by Zeus. So he isn’t exactly handsome. Clever with his hands, and all,
                        but Aphrodite
                        isn’t into brains and talent, you know?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She likes bikers.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Whatever.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hephaestus knows?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh sure,” Annabeth said. “He caught them together once. I mean, literally
                        caught them, in a
                        golden net, and invited all the gods to come and laugh at them. Hephaestus is always trying to
                        embarrass them.
                        That’s why they meet in out-of-the-way places, like…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She stopped, looking straight ahead. “Like that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In front of us was an empty pool that would’ve been awesome for skateboarding.
                        It was at least
                        fifty yards across and shaped like a bowl. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Around the rim, a dozen bronze statues of Cupid stood guard with wings spread
                        and bows ready to
                        fire. On the opposite side from us, a tunnel opened up, probably where the water flowed into
                        when the pool was
                        full. The sign above it read, <small class="calibre4">THRILL RIDE O’ LOVE: THIS IS NOT YOUR
                            PARENTS’ TUNNEL OF
                            LOVE!</small> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover crept toward the edge. “Guys, look.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Marooned at the bottom of the pool was a pink-and-white two-seater boat with a
                        canopy over the
                        top and little hearts painted all over it. In the left seat, glinting in the fading light, was
                        Ares’s shield, a
                        polished circle of bronze. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is too easy,” I said. “So we just walk down there and get it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth ran her fingers along the base of the nearest Cupid statue. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There’s a Greek letter carved here,” she said. “Eta. I wonder…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover,” I said, “you smell any monsters?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He sniffed the wind. “Nothing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nothing—like, in-the-Arch-and-you-didn’t-smell-Echidna nothing, or really
                        nothing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover looked hurt. “I told you, that was underground.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Okay, I’m sorry.” I took a deep breath. “I’m going down there.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll go with you.” Grover didn’t sound too enthusiastic, but I got the feeling
                        he was trying
                        to make up for what had happened in St. Louis. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I told him. “I want you to stay up top with the flying shoes. You’re the
                        Red Baron, a
                        flying ace, remember? I’ll be counting on you for backup, in case something goes wrong.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover puffed up his chest a little. “Sure. But what could go wrong?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know. Just a feeling. Annabeth, come with me—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are you kidding?” She looked at me as if I’d just dropped from the moon. Her
                        cheeks were
                        bright red. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s the problem now?” I demanded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Me, go with you to the…the ‘Thrill Ride of Love’? How embarrassing is that?
                        What if somebody
                        saw me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who’s going to see you?” But my face was burning now, too. Leave it to a girl
                        to make
                        everything complicated. “Fine,” I told her. “I’ll do it myself.” But when I started down the
                        side of the pool,
                        she followed me, muttering about how boys always messed things up. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/15-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We reached the boat. The shield was propped on one seat, and next to it was a
                        lady’s silk
                        scarf. I tried to imagine Ares and Aphrodite here, a couple of gods meeting in a junked-out
                        amusement-park ride.
                        Why? Then I noticed something I hadn’t seen from up top: mirrors all the way around the rim of
                        the pool, facing
                        this spot. We could see ourselves no matter which direction we looked. That must be it. While
                        Ares and Aphrodite
                        were smooching with each other they could look at their favorite people: themselves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I picked up the scarf. It shimmered pink, and the perfume was
                        indescribable—rose, or mountain
                        laurel. Something good. I smiled, a little dreamy, and was about to rub the scarf against my
                        cheek when Annabeth
                        ripped it out of my hand and stuffed it in her pocket. “Oh, no you don’t. Stay away from that
                        love magic.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Just get the shield, Seaweed Brain, and let’s get out of here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The moment I touched the shield, I knew we were in trouble. My hand broke
                        through something
                        that had been connecting it to the dashboard. A cobweb, I thought, but then I looked at a strand
                        of it on my
                        palm and saw it was some kind of metal filament, so fine it was almost invisible. A trip wire.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Too late.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There’s another Greek letter on the side of the boat, another Eta. This is a
                        trap.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Noise erupted all around us, of a million gears grinding, as if the whole pool
                        were turning
                        into one giant machine. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover yelled, “Guys!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Up on the rim, the Cupid statues were drawing their bows into firing position.
                        Before I could
                        suggest taking cover, they shot, but not at us. They fired at each other, across the rim of the
                        pool. Silky
                        cables trailed from the arrows, arcing over the pool and anchoring where they landed to form a
                        huge golden
                        asterisk. Then smaller metallic threads started weaving together magically between the main
                        strands, making a
                        net. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We have to get out,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Duh!” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I grabbed the shield and we ran, but going up the slope of the pool was not as
                        easy as going
                        down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on!” Grover shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was trying to hold open a section of the net for us, but wherever he touched
                        it, the golden
                        threads started to wrap around his hands. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Cupids’ heads popped open. Out came video cameras. Spotlights rose up all
                        around the pool,
                        blinding us with illumination, and a loudspeaker voice boomed: “Live to Olympus in one
                        minute…Fifty-nine
                        seconds, fifty-eight…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hephaestus!” Annabeth screamed. “I’m so stupid! Eta is ‘H.’ He made this trap
                        to catch his
                        wife with Ares. Now we’re going to be broadcast live to Olympus and look like absolute fools!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We’d almost made it to the rim when the row of mirrors opened like hatches and
                        thousands of
                        tiny metallic…things poured out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth screamed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was an army of wind-up creepy-crawlies: bronze-gear bodies, spindly legs,
                        little pincer
                        mouths, all scuttling toward us in a wave of clacking, whirring metal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Spiders!” Annabeth said. “Sp—sp—aaaah!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d never seen her like this before. She fell backward in terror and almost got
                        overwhelmed by
                        the spider robots before I pulled her up and dragged her back toward the boat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The things were coming out from all around the rim now, millions of them,
                        flooding toward the
                        center of the pool, completely surrounding us. I told myself they probably weren’t programmed to
                        kill, just
                        corral us and bite us and make us look stupid. Then again, this was a trap meant for gods. And
                        we weren’t gods.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and I climbed into the boat. I started kicking away the spiders as
                        they swarmed
                        aboard. I yelled at Annabeth to help me, but she was too paralyzed to do much more than scream.
                    </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“Thirty, twenty-nine,” called the loudspeaker. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The spiders started spitting out strands of metal thread, trying to tie us
                        down. The strands
                        were easy enough to break at first, but there were so many of them, and the spiders just kept
                        coming. I kicked
                        one away from Annabeth’s leg and its pincers took a chunk out of my new surf shoe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover hovered above the pool in his flying sneakers, trying to pull the net
                        loose, but it
                        wouldn’t budge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Think, I told myself. Think. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Tunnel of Love entrance was under the net. We could use it as an exit,
                        except that it was
                        blocked by a million robot spiders. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fifteen, fourteen,” the loudspeaker called. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Water, I thought. Where does the ride’s water come from? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I saw them: huge water pipes behind the mirrors, where the spiders had
                        come from. And up
                        above the net, next to one of the Cupids, a glass-windowed booth that must be the controller’s
                        station. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover!” I yelled. “Get into that booth! Find the ‘on’ switch!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Do it!” It was a crazy hope, but it was our only chance. The spiders were all
                        over the prow of
                        the boat now. Annabeth was screaming her head off. I had to get us out of there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was in the controller’s booth now, slamming away at the buttons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Five, four—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover looked up at me hopelessly, raising his hands. He was letting me know
                        that he’d pushed
                        every button, but still nothing was happening. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I closed my eyes and thought about waves, rushing water, the Mississippi River.
                        I felt a
                        familiar tug in my gut. I tried to imagine that I was dragging the ocean all the way to Denver.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Two, one, <em class="calibre5">zero</em>!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Water exploded out of the pipes. It roared into the pool, sweeping away the
                        spiders. I pulled
                        Annabeth into the seat next to me and fastened her seat belt just as the tidal wave slammed into
                        our boat, over
                        the top, whisking the spiders away and dousing us completely, but not capsizing us. The boat
                        turned, lifted in
                        the flood, and spun in circles around the whirlpool. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The water was full of short-circuiting spiders, some of them smashing against
                        the pool’s
                        concrete wall with such force they burst. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Spotlights glared down at us. The Cupid-cams were rolling, live to Olympus.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But I could only concentrate on controlling the boat. I willed it to ride the
                        current, to keep
                        away from the wall. Maybe it was my imagination, but the boat seemed to respond. At least, it
                        didn’t break into
                        a million pieces. We spun around one last time, the water level now almost high enough to shred
                        us against the
                        metal net. Then the boat’s nose turned toward the tunnel and we rocketed through into the
                        darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and I held tight, both of us screaming as the boat shot curls and
                        hugged corners and
                        took forty-five-degree plunges past pictures of Romeo and Juliet and a bunch of other
                        Valentine’s Day stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then we were out of the tunnel, the night air whistling through our hair as the
                        boat barreled
                        straight toward the exit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">If the ride had been in working order, we would’ve sailed off a ramp between
                        the golden Gates
                        of Love and splashed down safely in the exit pool. But there was a problem. The Gates of Love
                        were chained. Two
                        boats that had been washed out of the tunnel before us were now piled against the barricade—one
                        submerged, the
                        other cracked in half. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Unfasten your seat belt,” I yelled to Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Are you crazy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Unless you want to get smashed to death.” I strapped Ares’s shield to my arm.
                        “We’re going to
                        have to jump for it.” My idea was simple and insane. As the boat struck, we would use its force
                        like a
                        springboard to jump the gate. I’d heard of people surviving car crashes that way, getting thrown
                        thirty or forty
                        feet away from an accident. With luck, we would land in the pool. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth seemed to understand. She gripped my hand as the gates got closer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“On my mark,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No! On my mark!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Simple physics!” she yelled. “Force times the trajectory angle—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fine!” I shouted. “On <em class="calibre5">your </em>mark!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She hesitated…hesitated…then yelled, “Now!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Crack!</em> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth was right. If we’d jumped when I thought we should’ve, we would’ve
                        crashed into the
                        gates. She got us maximum lift. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Unfortunately, that was a little more than we needed. Our boat smashed into the
                        pileup and we
                        were thrown into the air, straight over the gates, over the pool, and down toward solid asphalt.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Something grabbed me from behind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth yelled, “Ouch!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover! </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In midair, he had grabbed me by the shirt, and Annabeth by the arm, and was
                        trying to pull us
                        out of a crash landing, but Annabeth and I had all the momentum. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re too heavy!” Grover said. “We’re going down!” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/15-8.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We spiraled toward the ground, Grover doing his best to slow the fall. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We smashed into a photo-board, Grover’s head going straight into the hole where
                        tourists would
                        put their faces, pretending to be Noo-Noo the Friendly Whale. Annabeth and I tumbled to the
                        ground, banged up
                        but alive. Ares’s shield was still on my arm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Once we caught our breath, Annabeth and I got Grover out of the photo-board and
                        thanked him for
                        saving our lives. I looked back at the Thrill Ride of Love. The water was subsiding. Our boat
                        had been smashed
                        to pieces against the gates. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A hundred yards away, at the entrance pool, the Cupids were still filming. The
                        statues had
                        swiveled so that their cameras were trained straight on us, the spotlights in our faces. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Show’s over!” I yelled. “Thank you! Good night!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Cupids turned back to their original positions. The lights shut off. The
                        park went quiet
                        and dark again, except for the gentle trickle of water into the Thrill Ride of Love’s exit pool.
                        I wondered if
                        Olympus had gone to a commercial break, or if our ratings had been any good. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hated being teased. I hated being tricked. And I had plenty of experience
                        handling bullies
                        who liked to do that stuff to me. I hefted the shield on my arm and turned to my friends. “We
                        need to have a
                        little talk with Ares.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">T</span>he war god was waiting for us in the diner parking
                        lot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, well,” he said. “You didn’t get yourself killed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You knew it was a trap,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares gave me a wicked grin. “Bet that crippled blacksmith was surprised when he
                        netted a couple
                        of stupid kids. You looked good on TV.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shoved his shield at him. “You’re a jerk.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and Grover caught their breath. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares grabbed the shield and spun it in the air like pizza dough. It changed
                        form, melting into
                        a bulletproof vest. He slung it across his back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“See that truck over there?” He pointed to an eighteen-wheeler parked across
                        the street from
                        the diner. “That’s your ride. Take you straight to L.A., with one stop in Vegas.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The eighteen-wheeler had a sign on the back, which I could read only because it
                        was
                        reverse-printed white on black, a good combination for dyslexia: <small

                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “You’re kidding.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares snapped his fingers. The back door of the truck unlatched. “Free ride
                        west, punk. Stop
                        complaining. And here’s a little something for doing the job.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He slung a blue nylon backpack off his handlebars and tossed it to me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Inside were fresh clothes for all of us, twenty bucks in cash, a pouch full of
                        golden drachmas,
                        and a bag of Double Stuf Oreos. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “I don’t want your lousy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thank you, Lord Ares,” Grover interrupted, giving me his best red-alert
                        warning look. “Thanks
                        a lot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I gritted my teeth. It was probably a deadly insult to refuse something from a
                        god, but I
                        didn’t want anything that Ares had touched. Reluctantly, I slung the backpack over my shoulder.
                        I knew my anger
                        was being caused by the war god’s presence, but I was still itching to punch him in the nose. He
                        reminded me of
                        every bully I’d ever faced: Nancy Bobofit, Clarisse, Smelly Gabe, sarcastic teachers—every jerk
                        who’d called me
                        stupid in school or laughed at me when I’d gotten expelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked back at the diner, which had only a couple of customers now. The
                        waitress who’d served
                        us dinner was watching nervously out the window, like she was afraid Ares might hurt us. She
                        dragged the fry
                        cook out from the kitchen to see. She said something to him. He nodded, held up a little
                        disposable camera and
                        snapped a picture of us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Great, I thought. We’ll make the papers again tomorrow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I imagined the headline: <small class="calibre4">TWELVE-YEAR-OLD OUTLAW BEATS
                            UP DEFENSELESS
                            BIKER</small>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You owe me one more thing,” I told Ares, trying to keep my voice level. “You
                        promised me
                        information about my mother.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You sure you can handle the news?” He kick-started his motorcycle. “She’s not
                        dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The ground seemed to spin beneath me. “What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I mean she was taken away from the Minotaur before she could die. She was
                        turned into a shower
                        of gold, right? That’s metamorphosis. Not death. She’s being kept.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Kept. Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You need to study war, punk. Hostages. You take somebody to control somebody
                        else.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nobody’s controlling me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He laughed. “Oh yeah? See you around, kid.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I balled up my fists. “You’re pretty smug, Lord Ares, for a guy who runs from
                        Cupid statues.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Behind his sunglasses, fire glowed. I felt a hot wind in my hair. “We’ll meet
                        again, Percy
                        Jackson. Next time you’re in a fight, watch your back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He revved his Harley, then roared off down Delancy Street. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “That was not smart, Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t care.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You don’t want a god as your enemy. Especially not that god.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, guys,” Grover said. “I hate to interrupt, but…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pointed toward the diner. At the register, the last two customers were
                        paying their check,
                        two men in identical black coveralls, with a white logo on their backs that matched the one on
                        the <small class="calibre4">KINDNESS INTERNATIONAL</small> truck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If we’re taking the zoo express,” Grover said, “we need to hurry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t like it, but we had no better option. Besides, I’d seen enough of
                        Denver. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We ran across the street and climbed in the back of the big rig, closing the
                        doors behind us.
                    </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The first thing that hit me was the smell. It was like the world’s biggest pan
                        of kitty litter.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The trailer was dark inside until I uncapped Anaklusmos. The blade cast a faint
                        bronze light
                        over a very sad scene. Sitting in a row of filthy metal cages were three of the most pathetic
                        zoo animals I’d
                        ever beheld: a zebra, a male albino lion, and some weird antelope thing I didn’t know the name
                        for. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Someone had thrown the lion a sack of turnips, which he obviously didn’t want
                        to eat. The zebra
                        and the antelope had each gotten a Styrofoam tray of hamburger meat. The zebra’s mane was matted
                        with chewing
                        gum, like somebody had been spitting on it in their spare time. The antelope had a stupid silver
                        birthday
                        balloon tied to one of his horns that read <small class="calibre4">OVER THE HILL!</small> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Apparently, nobody had wanted to get close enough to the lion to mess with him,
                        but the poor
                        thing was pacing around on soiled blankets, in a space way too small for him, panting from the
                        stuffy heat of
                        the trailer. He had flies buzzing around his pink eyes and his ribs showed through his white
                        fur. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/16-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is kindness?” Grover yelled. “Humane zoo transport?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He probably would’ve gone right back outside to beat up the truckers with his
                        reed pipes, and I
                        would’ve helped him, but just then the truck’s engine roared to life, the trailer started
                        shaking, and we were
                        forced to sit down or fall down. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We huddled in the corner on some mildewed feed sacks, trying to ignore the
                        smell and the heat
                        and the flies. Grover talked to the animals in a series of goat bleats, but they just stared at
                        him sadly.
                        Annabeth was in favor of breaking the cages and freeing them on the spot, but I pointed out it
                        wouldn’t do much
                        good until the truck stopped moving. Besides, I had a feeling we might look a lot better to the
                        lion than those
                        turnips. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I found a water jug and refilled their bowls, then used Anaklusmos to drag the
                        mismatched food
                        out of their cages. I gave the meat to the lion and the turnips to the zebra and the antelope.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover calmed the antelope down, while Annabeth used her knife to cut the
                        balloon off his horn.
                        She wanted to cut the gum out of the zebra’s mane, too, but we decided that would be too risky
                        with the truck
                        bumping around. We told Grover to promise the animals we’d help them more in the morning, then
                        we settled in for
                        night. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover curled up on a turnip sack; Annabeth opened our bag of Double Stuf Oreos
                        and nibbled on
                        one halfheartedly; I tried to cheer myself up by concentrating on the fact that we were halfway
                        to Los Angeles.
                        Halfway to our destination. It was only June fourteenth. The solstice wasn’t until the
                        twenty-first. We could
                        make it in plenty of time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">On the other hand, I had no idea what to expect next. The gods kept toying with
                        me. At least
                        Hephaestus had the decency to be honest about it—he’d put up cameras and advertised me as
                        entertainment. But
                        even when the cameras weren’t rolling, I had a feeling my quest was being watched. I was a
                        source of amusement
                        for the gods. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/16-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey,” Annabeth said, “I’m sorry for freaking out back at the water park,
                        Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s okay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s just…” She shuddered. “Spiders.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because of the Arachne story,” I guessed. “She got turned into a spider for
                        challenging your
                        mom to a weaving contest, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth nodded. “Arachne’s children have been taking revenge on the children
                        of Athena ever
                        since. If there’s a spider within a mile of me, it’ll find me. I hate the creepy little things.
                        Anyway, I owe
                        you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re a team, remember?” I said. “Besides, Grover did the fancy flying.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought he was asleep, but he mumbled from the corner, “I was pretty amazing,
                        wasn’t I?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and I laughed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pulled apart an Oreo, handed me half. “In the Iris message…did Luke really
                        say nothing?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I munched my cookie and thought about how to answer. The conversation via
                        rainbow had bothered
                        me all evening. “Luke said you and he go way back. He also said Grover wouldn’t fail this time.
                        Nobody would
                        turn into a pine tree.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the dim bronze light of the sword blade, it was hard to read their
                        expressions. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover let out a mournful bray. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I should’ve told you the truth from the beginning.” His voice trembled. “I
                        thought if you knew
                        what a failure I was, you wouldn’t want me along.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You were the satyr who tried to rescue Thalia, the daughter of Zeus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He nodded glumly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And the other two half-bloods Thalia befriended, the ones who got safely to
                        camp…” I looked at
                        Annabeth. “That was you and Luke, wasn’t it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She put down her Oreo, uneaten. “Like you said, Percy, a seven-year-old
                        half-blood wouldn’t
                        have made it very far alone. Athena guided me toward help. Thalia was twelve. Luke was fourteen.
                        They’d both run
                        away from home, like me. They were happy to take me with them. They were…amazing
                        monster-fighters, even without
                        training. We traveled north from Virginia without any real plans, fending off monsters for about
                        two weeks
                        before Grover found us.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I was supposed to escort Thalia to camp,” he said, sniffling. “Only Thalia. I
                        had strict
                        orders from Chiron: don’t do anything that would slow down the rescue. We knew Hades was after
                        her, see, but I
                        couldn’t just leave Luke and Annabeth by themselves. I thought…I thought I could lead all three
                        of them to
                        safety. It was my fault the Kindly Ones caught up with us. I froze. I got scared on the way back
                        to camp and
                        took some wrong turns. If I’d just been a little quicker…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stop it,” Annabeth said. “No one blames you. Thalia didn’t blame you either.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“She sacrificed herself to save us,” he said miserably. “Her death was my
                        fault. The Council of
                        Cloven Elders said so.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because you wouldn’t leave two other half-bloods behind?” I said. “That’s not
                        fair.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy’s right,” Annabeth said. “I wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for
                        you, Grover.
                        Neither would Luke. We don’t care what the council says.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover kept sniffling in the dark. “It’s just my luck. I’m the lamest satyr
                        ever, and I find
                        the two most powerful half-bloods of the century, Thalia and Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re not lame,” Annabeth insisted. “You’ve got more courage than any satyr
                        I’ve ever met.
                        Name one other who would dare go to the Underworld. I bet Percy is really glad you’re here right
                        now.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She kicked me in the shin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” I said, which I would’ve done even without the kick. “It’s not luck
                        that you found
                        Thalia and me, Grover. You’ve got the biggest heart of any satyr ever. You’re a natural
                        searcher. That’s why
                        you’ll be the one who finds Pan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I heard a deep, satisfied sigh. I waited for Grover to say something, but his
                        breathing only
                        got heavier. When the sound turned to snoring, I realized he’d fallen sleep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How does he do that?” I marveled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know,” Annabeth said. “But that was really a nice thing you told him.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I meant it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We rode in silence for a few miles, bumping around on the feed sacks. The zebra
                        munched a
                        turnip. The lion licked the last of the hamburger meat off his lips and looked at me hopefully.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth rubbed her necklace like she was thinking deep, strategic thoughts.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That pine-tree bead,” I said. “Is that from your first year?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked. She hadn’t realized what she was doing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” she said. “Every August, the counselors pick the most important event
                        of the summer,
                        and they paint it on that year’s beads. I’ve got Thalia’s pine tree, a Greek trireme on fire, a
                        centaur in a
                        prom dress—now <em class="calibre5">that </em>was a weird summer.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And the college ring is your father’s?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s none of your—” She stopped herself. “Yeah. Yeah, it is.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You don’t have to tell me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No…it’s okay.” She took a shaky breath. “My dad sent it to me folded up in a
                        letter, two
                        summers ago. The ring was, like, his main keepsake from Athena. He wouldn’t have gotten through
                        his doctoral
                        program at Harvard without her.…That’s a long story. Anyway, he said he wanted me to have it. He
                        apologized for
                        being a jerk, said he loved me and missed me. He wanted me to come home and live with him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That doesn’t sound so bad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, well…the problem was, I believed him. I tried to go home for that school
                        year, but my
                        stepmom was the same as ever. She didn’t want her kids put in danger by living with a freak.
                        Monsters attacked.
                        We argued. Monsters attacked. We argued. I didn’t even make it through winter break. I called
                        Chiron and came
                        right back to Camp Half-Blood.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You think you’ll ever try living with your dad again?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She wouldn’t meet my eyes. “Please. I’m not into self-inflicted pain.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You shouldn’t give up,” I told her. “You should write him a letter or
                        something.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thanks for the advice,” she said coldly, “but my father’s made his choice
                        about who he wants
                        to live with.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We passed another few miles of silence. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So if the gods fight,” I said, “will things line up the way they did with the
                        Trojan War? Will
                        it be Athena versus Poseidon?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She put her head against the backpack Ares had given us, and closed her eyes.
                        “I don’t know
                        what my mom will do. I just know I’ll fight next to you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Because you’re my friend, Seaweed Brain. Any more stupid questions?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t think of an answer for that. Fortunately I didn’t have to. Annabeth
                        was asleep. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I had trouble following her example, with Grover snoring and an albino lion
                        staring hungrily at
                        me, but eventually I closed my eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">My nightmare started out as something I’d dreamed a million times before: I was
                        being forced to
                        take a standardized test while wearing a straitjacket. All the other kids were going out to
                        recess, and the
                        teacher kept saying, <em class="calibre5">Come on, Percy. You’re not stupid, are you? Pick up
                            your pencil. </em>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then the dream strayed from the usual. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked over at the next desk and saw a girl sitting there, also wearing a
                        straitjacket. She
                        was my age, with unruly black, punk-style hair, dark eyeliner around her stormy green eyes, and
                        freckles across
                        her nose. Somehow, I knew who she was. She was Thalia, daughter of Zeus. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/16-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">She struggled against the straitjacket, glared at me in frustration, and
                        snapped, <em class="calibre5">Well, Seaweed Brain? One of us has to get out of here. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She’s right, my dream-self thought. I’m going back to that cavern. I’m going to
                        give Hades a
                        piece of my mind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The straitjacket melted off me. I fell through the classroom floor. The
                        teacher’s voice changed
                        until it was cold and evil, echoing from the depths of a great chasm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Percy Jackson, </em>it said. <em class="calibre5">Yes, the
                            exchange went
                            well, I see. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was back in the dark cavern, spirits of the dead drifting around me. Unseen
                        in the pit, the
                        monstrous thing was speaking, but this time it wasn’t addressing me. The numbing power of its
                        voice seemed
                        directed somewhere else. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">And he suspects nothing? </em>it asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Another voice, one I almost recognized, answered at my shoulder. <em
                            class="calibre5">Nothing,
                            my lord. He is as ignorant as the rest. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked over, but no one was there. The speaker was invisible. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Deception upon deception, </em>the thing in the pit mused
                        aloud. <em class="calibre5">Excellent. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Truly, my lord, </em>said the voice next to me, <em
                            class="calibre5">you
                            are well-named the Crooked One. But was it really necessary? I could have brought you what I
                            stole
                            directly—</em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">You? </em>the monster said in scorn. <em
                            class="calibre5">You have already
                            shown your limits. You would have failed me completely had I not intervened. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">But, my lord—</em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Peace, little servant. Our six months have bought us much.
                            Zeus’s anger
                            has grown. Poseidon has played his most desperate card. Now we shall use it against him.
                            Shortly you shall
                            have the reward you wish, and your revenge. As soon as both items are delivered into my
                            hands…but wait. He
                            is here. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">What? </em>The invisible servant suddenly sounded tense.
                        <em class="calibre5">You summoned him, my lord? </em>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">No. </em>The full force of the monster’s attention was now
                        pouring over
                        me, freezing me in place. <em class="calibre5">Blast his father’s blood—he is too changeable,
                            too unpredictable.
                            The boy brought himself hither. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Impossible! </em>the servant cried. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">For a weakling such as you, perhaps, </em>the voice
                        snarled. Then its cold
                        power turned back on me. <em class="calibre5">So…you wish to dream of your quest, young
                            half-blood? Then I will
                            oblige. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The scene changed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was standing in a vast throne room with black marble walls and bronze floors.
                        The empty,
                        horrid throne was made from human bones fused together. Standing at the foot of the dais was my
                        mother, frozen
                        in shimmering golden light, her arms outstretched. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to step toward her, but my legs wouldn’t move. I reached for her, only
                        to realize that
                        my hands were withering to bones. Grinning skeletons in Greek armor crowded around me, draping
                        me with silk
                        robes, wreathing my head with laurels that smoked with Chimera poison, burning into my scalp.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The evil voice began to laugh. <em class="calibre5">Hail, the conquering hero!
                        </em></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I woke with a start. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was shaking my shoulder. “The truck’s stopped,” he said. “We think
                        they’re coming to
                        check on the animals.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hide!” Annabeth hissed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She had it easy. She just put on her magic cap and disappeared. Grover and I
                        had to dive behind
                        feed sacks and hope we looked like turnips. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The trailer doors creaked open. Sunlight and heat poured in. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Man!” one of the truckers said, waving his hand in front of his ugly nose. “I
                        wish I hauled
                        appliances.” He climbed inside and poured some water from a jug into the animals’ dishes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You hot, big boy?” he asked the lion, then splashed the rest of the bucket
                        right in the lion’s
                        face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The lion roared in indignation. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” the man said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Next to me, under the turnip sacks, Grover tensed. For a peace-loving
                        herbivore, he looked
                        downright murderous. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The trucker threw the antelope a squashed-looking Happy Meal bag. He smirked at
                        the zebra. “How
                        ya doin’, Stripes? Least we’ll be getting rid of <em class="calibre5">you </em>this stop. You
                        like magic shows?
                        You’re gonna love this one. They’re gonna saw you in half!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The zebra, wild-eyed with fear, looked straight at me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was no sound, but as clear as day, I heard it say: <em
                            class="calibre5">Free me, lord.
                            Please. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was too stunned to react. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a loud <em class="calibre5">knock, knock, knock </em>on the side of
                        the trailer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The trucker inside with us yelled, “What do you want, Eddie?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A voice outside—it must’ve been Eddie’s—shouted back, “Maurice? What’d ya say?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What are you banging for?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Knock, knock, knock. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Outside, Eddie yelled, “What banging?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Our guy Maurice rolled his eyes and went back outside, cursing at Eddie for
                        being an idiot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A second later, Annabeth appeared next to me. She must’ve done the banging to
                        get Maurice out
                        of the trailer. She said, “This transport business can’t be legal.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No kidding,” Grover said. He paused, as if listening. “The lion says these
                        guys are animal
                        smugglers!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">That’s right, </em>the zebra’s voice said in my mind. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ve got to free them!” Grover said. He and Annabeth both looked at me,
                        waiting for my lead.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d heard the zebra talk, but not the lion. Why? Maybe it was another learning
                        disability…I
                        could only understand zebras? Then I thought: horses. What had Annabeth said about Poseidon
                        creating horses? Was
                        a zebra close enough to a horse? Was that why I could understand it? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The zebra said, <em class="calibre5">Open my cage, lord. Please. I’ll be fine
                            after that. </em>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Outside, Eddie and Maurice were still yelling at each other, but I knew they’d
                        be coming inside
                        to torment the animals again any minute. I grabbed Riptide and slashed the lock off the zebra’s
                        cage. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The zebra burst out. It turned to me and bowed. <em class="calibre5">Thank you,
                            lord. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover held up his hands and said something to the zebra in goat talk, like a
                        blessing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Just as Maurice was poking his head back inside to check out the noise, the
                        zebra leaped over
                        him and into the street. There was yelling and screaming and cars honking. We rushed to the
                        doors of the trailer
                        in time to see the zebra galloping down a wide boulevard lined with hotels and casinos and neon
                        signs. We’d just
                        released a zebra in Las Vegas. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Maurice and Eddie ran after it, with a few policemen running after them,
                        shouting, “Hey! You
                        need a permit for that!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now would be a good time to leave,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The other animals first,” Grover said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I cut the locks with my sword. Grover raised his hands and spoke the same
                        goat-blessing he’d
                        used for the zebra. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good luck,” I told the animals. The antelope and the lion burst out of their
                        cages and went
                        off together into the streets. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Some tourists screamed. Most just backed off and took pictures, probably
                        thinking it was some
                        kind of stunt by one of the casinos. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Will the animals be okay?” I asked Grover. “I mean, the desert and all—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t worry,” he said. “I placed a satyr’s sanctuary on them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Meaning?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Meaning they’ll reach the wild safely,” he said. “They’ll find water, food,
                        shade, whatever
                        they need until they find a safe place to live.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why can’t you place a blessing like that on us?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It only works on wild animals.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So it would only affect Percy,” Annabeth reasoned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” I protested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Kidding,” she said. “Come on. Let’s get out of this filthy truck.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We stumbled out into the desert afternoon. It was a hundred and ten degrees,
                        easy, and we
                        must’ve looked like deep-fried vagrants, but everybody was too interested in the wild animals to
                        pay us much
                        attention. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We passed the Monte Carlo and the MGM. We passed pyramids, a pirate ship, and
                        the Statue of
                        Liberty, which was a pretty small replica, but still made me homesick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t sure what we were looking for. Maybe just a place to get out of the
                        heat for a few
                        minutes, find a sandwich and a glass of lemonade, make a new plan for getting west. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We must have taken a wrong turn, because we found ourselves at a dead end,
                        standing in front of
                        the Lotus Hotel and Casino. The entrance was a huge neon flower, the petals lighting up and
                        blinking. No one was
                        going in or out, but the glittering chrome doors were open, spilling out air-conditioning that
                        smelled like
                        flowers—lotus blossom, maybe. I’d never smelled one, so I wasn’t sure. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The doorman smiled at us. “Hey, kids. You look tired. You want to come in and
                        sit down?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d learned to be suspicious, the last week or so. I figured anybody might be a
                        monster or a
                        god. You just couldn’t tell. But this guy was normal. One look at him, and I could see. Besides,
                        I was so
                        relieved to hear somebody who sounded sympathetic that I nodded and said we’d love to come in.
                        Inside, we took
                        one look around, and Grover said, “Whoa.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The whole lobby was a giant game room. And I’m not talking about cheesy old
                        Pac-Man games or
                        slot machines. There was an indoor waterslide snaking around the glass elevator, which went
                        straight up at least
                        forty floors. There was a climbing wall on the side of one building, and an indoor
                        bungee-jumping bridge. There
                        were virtual-reality suits with working laser guns. And hundreds of video games, each one the
                        size of a
                        widescreen TV. Basically, you name it, this place had it. There were a few other kids playing,
                        but not that
                        many. No waiting for any of the games. There were waitresses and snack bars all around, serving
                        every kind of
                        food you can imagine. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” a bellhop said. At least I guessed he was a bellhop. He wore a
                        white-and-yellow Hawaiian
                        shirt with lotus designs, shorts, and flip-flops. “Welcome to the Lotus Casino. Here’s your room
                        key.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stammered, “Um, but…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No, no,” he said, laughing. “The bill’s taken care of. No extra charges, no
                        tips. Just go on
                        up to the top floor, room 4001. If you need anything, like extra bubbles for the hot tub, or
                        skeet targets for
                        the shooting range, or whatever, just call the front desk. Here are your LotusCash cards. They
                        work in the
                        restaurants and on all the games and rides.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He handed us each a green plastic credit card. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew there must be some mistake. Obviously he thought we were some
                        millionaire’s kids. But I
                        took the card and said, “How much is on here?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His eyebrows knit together. “What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I mean, when does it run out of cash?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He laughed. “Oh, you’re making a joke. Hey, that’s cool. Enjoy your stay.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We took the elevator upstairs and checked out our room. It was a suite with
                        three separate
                        bedrooms and a bar stocked with candy, sodas, and chips. A hotline to room service. Fluffy
                        towels and water beds
                        with feather pillows. A big-screen television with satellite and high-speed Internet. The
                        balcony had its own
                        hot tub, and sure enough, there was a skeet-shooting machine and a shotgun, so you could launch
                        clay pigeons
                        right out over the Las Vegas skyline and plug them with your gun. I didn’t see how that could be
                        legal, but I
                        thought it was pretty cool. The view over the Strip and the desert was amazing, though I doubted
                        we’d ever find
                        time to look at the view with a room like this. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, goodness,” Annabeth said. “This place is…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sweet,” Grover said. “Absolutely sweet.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There were clothes in the closet, and they fit me. I frowned, thinking that
                        this was a little
                        strange. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I threw Ares’s backpack in the trash can. Wouldn’t need that anymore. When we
                        left, I could
                        just charge a new one at the hotel store. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took a shower, which felt awesome after a week of grimy travel. I changed
                        clothes, ate a bag
                        of chips, drank three Cokes, and came out feeling better than I had in a long time. In the back
                        of my mind, some
                        small problem kept nagging me. I’d had a dream or something…I needed to talk to my friends. But
                        I was sure it
                        could wait. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I came out of the bedroom and found that Annabeth and Grover had also showered
                        and changed
                        clothes. Grover was eating potato chips to his heart’s content, while Annabeth cranked up the
                        National
                        Geographic Channel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All those stations,” I told her, “and you turn on National Geographic. Are you
                        insane?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s interesting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I feel good,” Grover said. “I love this place.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Without his even realizing it, the wings sprouted out of his shoes and lifted
                        him a foot off
                        the ground, then back down again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So what now?” Annabeth asked. “Sleep?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and I looked at each other and grinned. We both held up our green
                        plastic LotusCash
                        cards. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Play time,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t remember the last time I had so much fun. I came from a relatively
                        poor family. Our
                        idea of a splurge was eating out at Burger King and renting a video. A five-star Vegas hotel?
                        Forget it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I bungee-jumped the lobby five or six times, did the waterslide, snowboarded
                        the artificial ski
                        slope, and played virtual-reality laser tag and FBI sharpshooter. I saw Grover a few times,
                        going from game to
                        game. He really liked the reverse hunter thing—where the deer go out and shoot the rednecks. I
                        saw Annabeth
                        playing trivia games and other brainiac stuff. They had this huge 3-D sim game where you build
                        your own city,
                        and you could actually see the holographic buildings rise on the display board. I didn’t think
                        much of it, but
                        Annabeth loved it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’m not sure when I first realized something was wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Probably, it was when I noticed the guy standing next to me at VR
                        sharpshooters. He was about
                        thirteen, I guess, but his clothes were weird. I thought he was some Elvis impersonator’s son.
                        He wore
                        bell-bottom jeans and a red T-shirt with black piping, and his hair was permed and gelled like a
                        New Jersey
                        girl’s on homecoming night. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/16-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">We played a game of sharpshooters together and he said, “Groovy, man. Been here
                        two weeks, and
                        the games keep getting better and better.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Groovy?</em> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Later, while we were talking, I said something was “sick,” and he looked at me
                        kind of
                        startled, as if he’d never heard the word used that way before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He said his name was Darrin, but as soon as I started asking him questions he
                        got bored with me
                        and started to go back to the computer screen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “Hey, Darrin?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What year is it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He frowned at me. “In the game?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No. In real life.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He had to think about it. “1977.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I said, getting a little scared. “Really.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, man. Bad vibes. I got a game happening.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After that he totally ignored me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I started talking to people, and I found it wasn’t easy. They were glued to the
                        TV screen, or
                        the video game, or their food, or whatever. I found a guy who told me it was 1985. Another guy
                        told me it was
                        1993. They all claimed they hadn’t been in here very long, a few days, a few weeks at most. They
                        didn’t really
                        know and they didn’t care. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then it occurred to me: how long had I been here? It seemed like only a couple
                        of hours, but
                        was it? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to remember why we were here. We were going to Los Angeles. We were
                        supposed to find
                        the entrance to the Underworld. My mother…for a scary second, I had trouble remembering her
                        name. Sally. Sally
                        Jackson. I had to find her. I had to stop Hades from causing World War III. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I found Annabeth still building her city. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on,” I told her. “We’ve got to get out of here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No response. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shook her. “Annabeth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked up, annoyed. “What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We need to leave.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Leave? What are you talking about? I’ve just got the towers—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This place is a trap.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She didn’t respond until I shook her again. “What?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Listen. The Underworld. Our quest!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, come on, Percy. Just a few more minutes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Annabeth, there are people here from 1977. Kids who have never aged. You check
                        in, and you
                        stay forever.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So?” she asked. “Can you imagine a better place?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I grabbed her wrist and yanked her away from the game. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” She screamed and hit me, but nobody else even bothered looking at us.
                        They were too
                        busy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I made her look directly in my eyes. I said, “Spiders. Large, hairy spiders.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That jarred her. Her vision cleared. “Oh my gods,” she said. “How long have
                        we—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know, but we’ve got to find Grover.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We went searching, and found him still playing Virtual Deer Hunter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover!” we both shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He said, “Die, human! Die, silly polluting nasty person!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He turned the plastic gun on me and started clicking, as if I were just another
                        image from the
                        screen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at Annabeth, and together we took Grover by the arms and dragged him
                        away. His flying
                        shoes sprang to life and started tugging his legs in the other direction as he shouted, “No! I
                        just got to a new
                        level! No!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Lotus bellhop hurried up to us. “Well, now, are you ready for your platinum
                        cards?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’re leaving,” I told him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Such a shame,” he said, and I got the feeling that he really meant it, that
                        we’d be breaking
                        his heart if we went. “We just added an entire new floor full of games for platinum-card
                        members.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He held out the cards, and I wanted one. I knew that if I took one, I’d never
                        leave. I’d stay
                        here, happy forever, playing games forever, and soon I’d forget my mom, and my quest, and maybe
                        even my own
                        name. I’d be playing virtual rifleman with groovy Disco Darrin forever. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover reached for the card, but Annabeth yanked back his arm and said, “No,
                        thanks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We walked toward the door, and as we did, the smell of the food and the sounds
                        of the games
                        seemed to get more and more inviting. I thought about our room upstairs. We could just stay the
                        night, sleep in
                        a real bed for once.…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then we burst through the doors of the Lotus Casino and ran down the sidewalk.
                        It felt like
                        afternoon, about the same time of day we’d gone into the casino, but something was wrong. The
                        weather had
                        completely changed. It was stormy, with heat lightning flashing out in the desert. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares’s backpack was slung over my shoulder, which was odd, because I was sure I
                        had thrown it
                        in the trash can in room 4001, but at the moment I had other problems to worry about. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I ran to the nearest newspaper stand and read the year first. Thank the gods,
                        it was the same
                        year it had been when we went in. Then I noticed the date: June twentieth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We had been in the Lotus Casino for five days. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We had only one day left until the summer solstice. One day to complete our
                        quest. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">She loaded us into the back of a Vegas taxi as if we actually had money, and
                        told the driver,
                        “Los Angeles, please.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The cabbie chewed his cigar and sized us up. “That’s three hundred miles. For
                        that, you gotta
                        pay up front.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You accept casino debit cards?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He shrugged. “Some of ’em. Same as credit cards. I gotta swipe ’em through
                        first.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth handed him her green LotusCash card. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked at it skeptically. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Swipe it,” Annabeth invited. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He did. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His meter machine started rattling. The lights flashed. Finally an infinity
                        symbol came up next
                        to the dollar sign. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The cigar fell out of the driver’s mouth. He looked back at us, his eyes wide.
                        “Where to in Los
                        Angeles…uh, Your Highness?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Santa Monica Pier.” Annabeth sat up a little straighter. I could tell she
                        liked the “Your
                        Highness” thing. “Get us there fast, and you can keep the change.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Maybe she shouldn’t have told him that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The cab’s speedometer never dipped below ninety-five the whole way through the

                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">On the road, we had plenty of time to talk. I told Annabeth and Grover about my
                        latest dream,
                        but the details got sketchier the more I tried to remember them. The Lotus Casino seemed to have
                        short-circuited
                        my memory. I couldn’t recall what the invisible servant’s voice had sounded like, though I was
                        sure it was
                        somebody I knew. The servant had called the monster in the pit something other than “my
                        lord”…some special name
                        or title.…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Silent One?” Annabeth suggested. “The Rich One? Both of those are
                        nicknames for Hades.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe…” I said, though neither sounded quite right. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That throne room sounds like Hades’s,” Grover said. “That’s the way it’s
                        usually described.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shook my head. “Something’s wrong. The throne room wasn’t the main part of
                        the dream. And
                        that voice from the pit…I don’t know. It just didn’t feel like a god’s voice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s eyes widened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh…nothing. I was just—No, it <em class="calibre5">has </em>to be Hades. Maybe
                        he sent this
                        thief, this invisible person, to get the master bolt, and something went wrong—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Like what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I don’t know,” she said. “But if he stole Zeus’s symbol of power from
                        Olympus, and the gods
                        were hunting him, I mean, a lot of things could go wrong. So this thief had to hide the bolt, or
                        he lost it
                        somehow. Anyway, he failed to bring it to Hades. That’s what the voice said in your dream,
                        right? The guy
                        failed. That would explain what the Furies were searching for when they came after us on the
                        bus. Maybe they
                        thought we had retrieved the bolt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t sure what was wrong with her. She looked pale. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But if I’d already retrieved the bolt,” I said, “why would I be traveling to
                        the Underworld?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“To threaten Hades,” Grover suggested. “To bribe or blackmail him into getting
                        your mom back.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I whistled. “You have evil thoughts for a goat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Why, thank you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But the thing in the pit said it was waiting for <em class="calibre5">two
                        </em>items,” I said.
                        “If the master bolt is one, what’s the other?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shook his head, clearly mystified. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth was looking at me as if she knew my next question, and was silently
                        willing me not to
                        ask it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You have an idea what might be in that pit, don’t you?” I asked her. “I mean,
                        if it isn’t
                        Hades?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy…let’s not talk about it. Because if it isn’t Hades…No. It has to be
                        Hades.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Wasteland rolled by. We passed a sign that said <small
                            class="calibre4">CALIFORNIA STATE
                            LINE</small>, <small class="calibre4">12 MILES</small>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got the feeling I was missing one simple, critical piece of information. It
                        was like when I
                        stared at a common word I should know, but I couldn’t make sense of it because one or two
                        letters were floating
                        around. The more I thought about my quest, the more I was sure that confronting Hades wasn’t the
                        real answer.
                        There was something else going on, something even more dangerous. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The problem was: we were hurtling toward the Underworld at ninety-five miles an
                        hour, betting
                        that Hades had the master bolt. If we got there and found out we were wrong, we wouldn’t have
                        time to correct
                        ourselves. The solstice deadline would pass and war would begin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The answer is in the Underworld,” Annabeth assured me. “You saw spirits of the
                        dead, Percy.
                        There’s only one place that could be. We’re doing the right thing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She tried to boost our morale by suggesting clever strategies for getting into
                        the Land of the
                        Dead, but my heart wasn’t in it. There were just too many unknown factors. It was like cramming
                        for a test
                        without knowing the subject. And believe me, I’d done <em class="calibre5">that </em>enough
                        times. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">The cab sped west. Every gust of wind through Death Valley sounded like a
                        spirit of the dead.
                        Every time the brakes hissed on an eighteen-wheeler, it reminded me of Echidna’s reptilian
                        voice. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">At sunset, the taxi dropped us at the beach in Santa Monica. It looked exactly
                        the way L.A.
                        beaches do in the movies, only it smelled worse. There were carnival rides lining the Pier, palm
                        trees lining
                        the sidewalks, homeless guys sleeping in the sand dunes, and surfer dudes waiting for the
                        perfect wave. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover, Annabeth, and I walked down to the edge of the surf. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What now?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The Pacific was turning gold in the setting sun. I thought about how long it
                        had been since I’d
                        stood on the beach at Montauk, on the opposite side of the country, looking out at a different
                        sea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">How could there be a god who could control all that? What did my science
                        teacher used to
                        say—two-thirds of the earth’s surface was covered in water? How could I be the son of someone
                        that powerful?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stepped into the surf. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy?” Annabeth said. “What are you doing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I kept walking, up to my waist, then my chest. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/17-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">She called after me, “You know how polluted that water is? There’re all kinds
                        of toxic—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That’s when my head went under. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I held my breath at first. It’s difficult to intentionally inhale water.
                        Finally I couldn’t
                        stand it anymore. I gasped. Sure enough, I could breathe normally. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I walked down into the shoals. I shouldn’t have been able to see through the
                        murk, but somehow
                        I could tell where everything was. I could sense the rolling texture of the bottom. I could make
                        out sand-dollar
                        colonies dotting the sandbars. I could even see the currents, warm and cold streams swirling
                        together. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt something rub against my leg. I looked down and almost shot out of the
                        water like a
                        ballistic missile. Sliding along beside me was a five-foot-long mako shark. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But the thing wasn’t attacking. It was nuzzling me. Heeling like a dog.
                        Tentatively, I touched
                        its dorsal fin. It bucked a little, as if inviting me to hold tighter. I grabbed the fin with
                        both hands. It
                        took off, pulling me along. The shark carried me down into the darkness. It deposited me at the
                        edge of the
                        ocean proper, where the sand bank dropped off into a huge chasm. It was like standing on the rim
                        of the Grand
                        Canyon at midnight, not being able to see much, but knowing the void was right there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The surface shimmered maybe a hundred and fifty feet above. I knew I should’ve
                        been crushed by
                        the pressure. Then again, I shouldn’t have been able to breathe. I wondered if there was a limit
                        to how deep I
                        could go, if I could sink straight to the bottom of the Pacific. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I saw something glimmering in the darkness below, growing bigger and
                        brighter as it rose
                        toward me. A woman’s voice, like my mother’s, called: “Percy Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As she got closer, her shape became clearer. She had flowing black hair, a
                        dress made of green
                        silk. Light flickered around her, and her eyes were so distractingly beautiful I hardly noticed
                        the
                        stallion-sized sea horse she was riding. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She dismounted. The sea horse and the mako shark whisked off and started
                        playing something that
                        looked like tag. The underwater lady smiled at me. “You’ve come far, Percy Jackson. Well done.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t quite sure what to do, so I bowed. “You’re the woman who spoke to me
                        in the
                        Mississippi River.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, child. I am a Nereid, a spirit of the sea. It was not easy to appear so
                        far upriver, but
                        the naiads, my freshwater cousins, helped sustain my life force. They honor Lord Poseidon,
                        though they do not
                        serve in his court.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And…you serve in Poseidon’s court?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She nodded. “It has been many years since a child of the Sea God has been born.
                        We have watched
                        you with great interest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Suddenly I remembered faces in the waves off Montauk Beach when I was a little
                        boy, reflections
                        of smiling women. Like so many of the weird things in my life, I’d never given it much thought
                        before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If my father is so interested in me,” I said, “why isn’t he here? Why doesn’t
                        he speak to me?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A cold current rose out of the depths. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Do not judge the Lord of the Sea too harshly,” the Nereid told me. “He stands
                        at the brink of
                        an unwanted war. He has much to occupy his time. Besides, he is forbidden to help you directly.
                        The gods may not
                        show such favoritism.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Even to their own children?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Especially to them. The gods can work by indirect influence only. That is why
                        I give you a
                        warning, and a gift.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She held out her hand. Three white pearls flashed in her palm. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/17-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know you journey to Hades’s realm,” she said. “Few mortals have ever done
                        this and survived:
                        Orpheus, who had great music skill; Hercules, who had great strength; Houdini, who could escape
                        even the depths
                        of Tartarus. Do you have these talents?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um…no, ma’am.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah, but you have something else, Percy. You have gifts you have only begun to
                        know. The
                        oracles have foretold a great and terrible future for you, should you survive to manhood.
                        Poseidon would not
                        have you die before your time. Therefore take these, and when you are in need, smash a pearl at
                        your feet.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What will happen?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That,” she said, “depends on the need. But remember: what belongs to the sea
                        will always
                        return to the sea.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What about the warning?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her eyes flickered with green light. “Go with what your heart tells you, or you
                        will lose all.
                        Hades feeds on doubt and hopelessness. He will trick you if he can, make you mistrust your own
                        judgment. Once
                        you are in his realm, he will never willingly let you leave. Keep faith. Good luck, Percy
                        Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She summoned her sea horse and rode toward the void. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait!” I called. “At the river, you said not to trust the gifts. What gifts?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good-bye, young hero,” she called back, her voice fading into the depths. “You
                        must listen to
                        your heart.” She became a speck of glowing green, and then she was gone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to follow her down into the darkness. I wanted to see the court of
                        Poseidon. But I
                        looked up at the sunset darkening on the surface. My friends were waiting. We had so little
                        time.…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I kicked upward toward the shore. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When I reached the beach, my clothes dried instantly. I told Grover and
                        Annabeth what had
                        happened, and showed them the pearls. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth grimaced. “No gift comes without a price.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“They were free.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No.” She shook her head. “‘There is no such thing as a free lunch.’ That’s an
                        ancient Greek
                        saying that translated pretty well into American. There will be a price. You wait.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">On that happy thought, we turned our backs on the sea. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">With some spare change from Ares’s backpack, we took the bus into West
                        Hollywood. I showed the
                        driver the Underworld address slip I’d taken from Aunty Em’s Garden Gnome Emporium, but he’d
                        never heard of DOA
                        Recording Studios. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You remind me of somebody I saw on TV,” he told me. “You a child actor or
                        something?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Uh…I’m a stunt double…for a lot of child actors.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh! That explains it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We thanked him and got off quickly at the next stop. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We wandered for miles on foot, looking for DOA. Nobody seemed to know where it
                        was. It didn’t
                        appear in the phone book. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Twice, we ducked into alleys to avoid cop cars. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I froze in front of an appliance-store window because a television was playing
                        an interview
                        with somebody who looked very familiar—my stepdad, Smelly Gabe. He was talking to Barbara
                        Walters—I mean, as if
                        he were some kind of huge celebrity. She was interviewing him in our apartment, in the middle of
                        a poker game,
                        and there was a young blond lady sitting next to him, patting his hand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A fake tear glistened on his cheek. He was saying, “Honest, Ms. Walters, if it
                        wasn’t for Sugar
                        here, my grief counselor, I’d be a wreck. My stepson took everything I cared about. My wife…my
                        Camaro…I—I’m
                        sorry. I have trouble talking about it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There you have it, America.” Barbara Walters turned to the camera. “A man torn
                        apart. An
                        adolescent boy with serious issues. Let me show you, again, the last known photo of this
                        troubled young
                        fugitive, taken a week ago in Denver.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The screen cut to a grainy shot of me, Annabeth, and Grover standing outside
                        the Colorado
                        diner, talking to Ares. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who are the other children in this photo?” Barbara Walters asked dramatically.
                        “Who is the man
                        with them? Is Percy Jackson a delinquent, a terrorist, or perhaps the brainwashed victim of a
                        frightening new
                        cult? When we come back, we chat with a leading child psychologist. Stay tuned, America.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“C’mon,” Grover told me. He hauled me away before I could punch a hole in the
                        appliance-store
                        window. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It got dark, and hungry-looking characters started coming out on the streets to
                        play. Now,
                        don’t get me wrong. I’m a New Yorker. I don’t scare easy. But L.A. had a totally different feel
                        from New York.
                        Back home, everything seemed close. It didn’t matter how big the city was, you could get
                        anywhere without
                        getting lost. The street pattern and the subway made sense. There was a system to how things
                        worked. A kid could
                        be safe as long as he wasn’t stupid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">L.A. wasn’t like that. It was spread out, chaotic, hard to move around. It
                        reminded me of Ares.
                        It wasn’t enough for L.A. to be big; it had to prove it was big by being loud and strange and
                        difficult to
                        navigate, too. I didn’t know how we were ever going to find the entrance to the Underworld by
                        tomorrow, the
                        summer solstice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We walked past gangbangers, bums, and street hawkers, who looked at us like
                        they were trying to
                        figure if we were worth the trouble of mugging. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As we hurried passed the entrance of an alley, a voice from the darkness said,
                        “Hey, you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Like an idiot, I stopped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Before I knew it, we were surrounded. A gang of kids had circled us. Six of
                        them in all—white
                        kids with expensive clothes and mean faces. Like the kids at Yancy Academy: rich brats playing
                        at being bad
                        boys. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Instinctively, I uncapped Riptide. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/17-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">When the sword appeared out of nowhere, the kids backed off, but their leader
                        was either really
                        stupid or really brave, because he kept coming at me with a switchblade. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I made the mistake of swinging. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The kid yelped. But he must’ve been one hundred percent mortal, because the
                        blade passed
                        harmlessly right through his chest. He looked down. “What the…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I figured I had about three seconds before his shock turned to anger. “Run!” I
                        screamed at
                        Annabeth and Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We pushed two kids out of the way and raced down the street, not knowing where
                        we were going.
                        We turned a sharp corner. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There!” Annabeth shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Only one store on the block looked open, its windows glaring with neon. The
                        sign above the door
                        said something like <small class="calibre4">CRSTUY’S</small> <small class="calibre4">WATRE BDE
                            ALPACE</small>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Crusty’s Water Bed Palace?” Grover translated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It didn’t sound like a place I’d ever go except in an emergency, but this
                        definitely qualified.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We burst through the doors, ran behind a water bed, and ducked. A split second
                        later, the gang
                        kids ran past outside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I think we lost them,” Grover panted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A voice behind us boomed, “Lost who?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We all jumped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Standing behind us was a guy who looked like a raptor in a leisure suit. He was
                        at least seven
                        feet tall, with absolutely no hair. He had gray, leathery skin, thick-lidded eyes, and a cold,
                        reptilian smile.
                        He moved toward us slowly, but I got the feeling he could move fast if he needed to. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His suit might’ve come from the Lotus Casino. It belonged back in the
                        seventies, big-time. The
                        shirt was silk paisley, unbuttoned halfway down his hairless chest. The lapels on his velvet
                        jacket were as wide
                        as landing strips. The silver chains around his neck—I couldn’t even count them. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/17-5.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m Crusty,” he said, with a tartar-yellow smile. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I resisted the urge to say, <em class="calibre5">Yes, you are. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sorry to barge in,” I told him. “We were just, um, browsing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You mean hiding from those no-good kids,” he grumbled. “They hang around every
                        night. I get a
                        lot of people in here, thanks to them. Say, you want to look at a water bed?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to say <em class="calibre5">No, thanks</em>, when he put a huge paw
                        on my shoulder
                        and steered me deeper into the showroom. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was every kind of water bed you could imagine: different kinds of wood,
                        different
                        patterns of sheets; queen-size, king-size, emperor-of-the-universe-size. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is my most popular model.” Crusty spread his hands proudly over a bed
                        covered with black
                        satin sheets, with built-in Lava Lamps on the headboard. The mattress vibrated, so it looked
                        like oil-flavored
                        Jell-O. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Million-hand massage,” Crusty told us. “Go on, try it out. Shoot, take a nap.
                        I don’t care. No
                        business today, anyway.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um,” I said, “I don’t think…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Million-hand massage!” Grover cried, and dove in. “Oh, you guys! This is
                        cool.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hmm,” Crusty said, stroking his leathery chin. “Almost, almost.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Almost what?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He looked at Annabeth. “Do me a favor and try this one over here, honey. Might
                        fit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “But what—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He patted her reassuringly on the shoulder and led her over to the Safari
                        Deluxe model with
                        teakwood lions carved into the frame and a leopard-patterned comforter. When Annabeth didn’t
                        want to lie down,
                        Crusty pushed her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” she protested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Crusty snapped his fingers. <em class="calibre5">“Ergo!” </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ropes sprang from the sides of the bed, lashing around Annabeth, holding her to
                        the mattress.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover tried to get up, but ropes sprang from his black-satin bed, too, and
                        lashed him down.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“N-not c-c-cool!” he yelled, his voice vibrating from the million-hand massage.
                        “N-not c-cool
                        a-at all!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The giant looked at Annabeth, then turned toward me and grinned. “Almost, darn
                        it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to step away, but his hand shot out and clamped around the back of my
                        neck. “Whoa, kid.
                        Don’t worry. We’ll find you one in a sec.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Let my friends go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, sure I will. But I got to make them fit, first.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All the beds are exactly six feet, see? Your friends are too short. Got to
                        make them fit.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and Grover kept struggling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Can’t stand imperfect measurements,” Crusty muttered. <em
                            class="calibre5">“Ergo!” </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A new set of ropes leaped out from the top and bottom of the beds, wrapping
                        around Grover and
                        Annabeth’s ankles, then around their armpits. The ropes started tightening, pulling my friends
                        from both ends.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t worry,” Crusty told me. “These are stretching jobs. Maybe three extra
                        inches on their
                        spines. They might even live. Now why don’t we find a bed you like, huh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Grover yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mind was racing. I knew I couldn’t take on this giant water-bed salesman
                        alone. He would
                        snap my neck before I ever got my sword out. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your real name’s not Crusty, is it?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Legally, it’s Procrustes,” he admitted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The Stretcher,” I said. I remembered the story: the giant who’d tried to kill
                        Theseus with
                        excess hospitality on his way to Athens. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” the salesman said. “But who can pronounce <em
                            class="calibre5">Procrustes</em>? Bad for
                        business. Now ‘Crusty,’ anybody can say that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re right. It’s got a good ring to it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His eyes lit up. “You think so?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, absolutely,” I said. “And the workmanship on these beds? Fabulous!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He grinned hugely, but his fingers didn’t loosen on my neck. “I tell my
                        customers that. Every
                        time. Nobody bothers to look at the workmanship. How many built-in Lava Lamp headboards have you
                        seen?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not too many.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s right!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Annabeth yelled. “What are you doing?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t mind her,” I told Procrustes. “She’s impossible.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The giant laughed. “All my customers are. Never six feet exactly. So
                        inconsiderate. And then
                        they complain about the fitting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you do if they’re longer than six feet?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, that happens all the time. It’s a simple fix.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He let go of my neck, but before I could react, he reached behind a nearby
                        sales desk and
                        brought out a huge double-bladed brass axe. He said, “I just center the subject as best I can
                        and lop off
                        whatever hangs over on either end.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah,” I said, swallowing hard. “Sensible.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m so glad to come across an intelligent customer!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The ropes were really stretching my friends now. Annabeth was turning pale.
                        Grover made
                        gurgling sounds, like a strangled goose. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“So, Crusty…” I said, trying to keep my voice light. I glanced at the sales tag
                        on the
                        valentine-shaped Honeymoon Special. “Does this one really have dynamic stabilizers to stop wave
                        motion?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Absolutely. Try it out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, maybe I will. But would it work even for a big guy like you? No waves at
                        all?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Guaranteed.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Show me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He sat down eagerly on the bed, patted the mattress. “No waves. See?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I snapped my fingers. <em class="calibre5">“Ergo.” </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ropes lashed around Crusty and flattened him against the mattress. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey!” he yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Center him just right,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The ropes readjusted themselves at my command. Crusty’s whole head stuck out
                        the top. His feet
                        stuck out the bottom. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” he said. “Wait! This is just a demo.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/17-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I uncapped Riptide. “A few simple adjustments…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I had no qualms about what I was about to do. If Crusty were human, I couldn’t
                        hurt him anyway.
                        If he was a monster, he deserved to turn into dust for a while. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You drive a hard bargain,” he told me. “I’ll give you thirty percent off on
                        selected floor
                        models!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I think I’ll start with the top.” I raised my sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No money down! No interest for six months!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I swung the sword. Crusty stopped making offers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I cut the ropes on the other beds. Annabeth and Grover got to their feet,
                        groaning and wincing
                        and cursing me a lot. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You look taller,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Very funny,” Annabeth said. “Be faster next time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at the bulletin board behind Crusty’s sales desk. There was an
                        advertisement for
                        Hermes Delivery Service, and another for the All-New Compendium of L.A. Area Monsters—“The only
                        Monstrous Yellow
                        Pages you’ll ever need!” Under that, a bright orange flier for DOA Recording Studios, offering
                        commissions for
                        heroes’ souls. “We are always looking for new talent!” DOA’s address was right underneath with a
                        map. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on,” I told my friends. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Give us a minute,” Grover complained. “We were almost stretched to death!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Then you’re ready for the Underworld,” I said. “It’s only a block from here.”

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">W</span>e stood in the shadows of Valencia Boulevard,
                        looking up at gold
                        letters etched in black marble: <small class="calibre4">DOA RECORDING STUDIOS</small>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Underneath, stenciled on the glass doors: <small class="calibre4">NO

                            LIVING</small>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was almost midnight, but the lobby was brightly lit and full of people.
                        Behind the security
                        desk sat a tough-looking guard with sunglasses and an earpiece. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned to my friends. “Okay. You remember the plan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The plan,” Grover gulped. “Yeah. I love the plan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “What happens if the plan doesn’t work?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t think negative.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Right,” she said. “We’re entering the Land of the Dead, and I shouldn’t think
                        negative.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took the pearls out of my pocket, the three milky spheres the Nereid had
                        given me in Santa
                        Monica. They didn’t seem like much of a backup in case something went wrong. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth put her hand on my shoulder. “I’m sorry, Percy. You’re right, we’ll
                        make it. It’ll be
                        fine.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She gave Grover a nudge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, right!” he chimed in. “We got this far. We’ll find the master bolt and
                        save your mom. No
                        problem.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at them both, and felt really grateful. Only a few minutes before, I’d
                        almost gotten
                        them stretched to death on deluxe water beds, and now they were trying to be brave for my sake,
                        trying to make
                        me feel better. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I slipped the pearls back in my pocket. “Let’s whup some Underworld butt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We walked inside the DOA lobby. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Muzak played softly on hidden speakers. The carpet and walls were steel gray.
                        Pencil cactuses
                        grew in the corners like skeleton hands. The furniture was black leather, and every seat was
                        taken. There were
                        people sitting on couches, people standing up, people staring out the windows or waiting for the
                        elevator.
                        Nobody moved, or talked, or did much of anything. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see them
                        all just fine,
                        but if I focused on any one of them in particular, they started looking…transparent. I could see
                        right through
                        their bodies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The security guard’s desk was a raised podium, so we had to look up at him.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was tall and elegant, with chocolate-colored skin and bleached-blond hair
                        shaved military
                        style. He wore tortoiseshell shades and a silk Italian suit that matched his hair. A black rose
                        was pinned to
                        his lapel under a silver name tag. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I read the name tag, then looked at him in bewilderment. “Your name is Chiron?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He leaned across the desk. I couldn’t see anything in his glasses except my own
                        reflection, but
                        his smile was sweet and cold, like a python’s, right before it eats you. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/18-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“What a precious young lad.” He had a strange accent—British, maybe, but also
                        as if he had
                        learned English as a second language. “Tell me, mate, do I look like a centaur?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“N-no.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sir,” he added smoothly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sir,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He pinched the name tag and ran his finger under the letters. “Can you read
                        this, mate? It says
                        C-H-<em class="calibre5">A</em>-R-O-N. Say it with me: CARE-ON.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Charon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Amazing! Now: <em class="calibre5">Mr. </em>Charon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mr. Charon,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well done.” He sat back. “I <em class="calibre5">hate </em>being confused with
                        that old
                        horse-man. And now, how may I help you little dead ones?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His question caught in my stomach like a fastball. I looked at Annabeth for
                        support. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We want to go the Underworld,” she said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Charon’s mouth twitched. “Well, that’s refreshing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It is?” she asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Straightforward and honest. No screaming. No ‘There must be a mistake, Mr.
                        Charon.’” He looked
                        us over. “How did you die, then?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nudged Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh,” he said. “Um…drowned…in the bathtub.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All three of you?” Charon asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We nodded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Big bathtub.” Charon looked mildly impressed. “I don’t suppose you have coins
                        for passage.
                        Normally, with adults, you see, I could charge your American Express, or add the ferry price to
                        your last cable
                        bill. But with children…alas, you never die prepared. Suppose you’ll have to take a seat for a
                        few centuries.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, but we have coins.” I set three golden drachmas on the counter, part of
                        the stash I’d
                        found in Crusty’s office desk. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, now…” Charon moistened his lips. “Real drachmas. Real golden drachmas. I
                        haven’t seen
                        these in…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His fingers hovered greedily over the coins. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We were so close. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then Charon looked at me. That cold stare behind his glasses seemed to bore a
                        hole through my
                        chest. “Here now,” he said. “You couldn’t read my name correctly. Are you dyslexic, lad?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I said. “I’m dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Charon leaned forward and took a sniff. “You’re not dead. I should’ve known.
                        You’re a godling.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We have to get to the Underworld,” I insisted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Charon made a growling sound deep in his throat. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Immediately, all the people in the waiting room got up and started pacing,
                        agitated, lighting
                        cigarettes, running hands through their hair, or checking their wristwatches. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Leave while you can,” Charon told us. “I’ll just take these and forget I saw
                        you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He started to go for the coins, but I snatched them back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No service, no tip.” I tried to sound braver than I felt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Charon growled again—a deep, blood-chilling sound. The spirits of the dead
                        started pounding on
                        the elevator doors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s a shame, too,” I sighed. “We had more to offer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I held up the entire bag from Crusty’s stash. I took out a fistful of drachmas
                        and let the
                        coins spill through my fingers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Charon’s growl changed into something more like a lion’s purr. “Do you think I
                        can be bought,
                        godling? Eh…just out of curiosity, how much have you got there?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A lot,” I said. “I bet Hades doesn’t pay you well enough for such hard work.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, you don’t know the half of it. How would you like to babysit these spirits
                        all day? Always
                        ‘Please don’t let me be dead’ or ‘Please let me across for free.’ I haven’t had a pay raise in
                        three thousand
                        years. Do you imagine suits like this come cheap?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You deserve better,” I agreed. “A little appreciation. Respect. Good pay.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">With each word, I stacked another gold coin on the counter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Charon glanced down at his silk Italian jacket, as if imagining himself in
                        something even
                        better. “I must say, lad, you’re making some sense now. Just a little.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stacked another few coins. “I could mention a pay raise while I’m talking to
                        Hades.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He sighed. “The boat’s almost full, anyway. I might as well add you three and
                        be off.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He stood, scooped up our money, and said, “Come along.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We pushed through the crowd of waiting spirits, who started grabbing at our
                        clothes like the
                        wind, their voices whispering things I couldn’t make out. Charon shoved them out of the way,
                        grumbling,
                        “Freeloaders.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He escorted us into the elevator, which was already crowded with souls of the
                        dead, each one
                        holding a green boarding pass. Charon grabbed two spirits who were trying to get on with us and
                        pushed them back
                        into the lobby. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Right. Now, no one get any ideas while I’m gone,” he announced to the waiting
                        room. “And if
                        anyone moves the dial off my easy-listening station again, I’ll make sure you’re here for
                        another thousand
                        years. Understand?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He shut the doors. He put a key card into a slot in the elevator panel and we
                        started to
                        descend. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/18-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“What happens to the spirits waiting in the lobby?” Annabeth asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nothing,” Charon said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“For how long?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Forever, or until I’m feeling generous.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh,” she said. “That’s…fair.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Charon raised an eyebrow. “Whoever said death was fair, young miss? Wait until
                        it’s your turn.
                        You’ll die soon enough, where you’re going.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll get out alive,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ha.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got a sudden dizzy feeling. We weren’t going down anymore, but forward. The
                        air turned misty.
                        Spirits around me started changing shape. Their modern clothes flickered, turning into gray
                        hooded robes. The
                        floor of the elevator began swaying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I blinked hard. When I opened my eyes, Charon’s creamy Italian suit had been
                        replaced by a long
                        black robe. His tortoiseshell glasses were gone. Where his eyes should’ve been were empty
                        sockets—like Ares’s
                        eyes, except Charon’s were totally dark, full of night and death and despair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He saw me looking, and said, “Well?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nothing,” I managed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought he was grinning, but that wasn’t it. The flesh of his face was
                        becoming transparent,
                        letting me see straight through to his skull. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The floor kept swaying. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover said, “I think I’m getting seasick.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When I blinked again, the elevator wasn’t an elevator anymore. We were standing
                        in a wooden
                        barge. Charon was poling us across a dark, oily river, swirling with bones, dead fish, and
                        other, stranger
                        things—plastic dolls, crushed carnations, soggy diplomas with gilt edges. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The River Styx,” Annabeth murmured. “It’s so…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Polluted,” Charon said. “For thousands of years, you humans have been throwing
                        in everything
                        as you come across—hopes, dreams, wishes that never came true. Irresponsible waste management,
                        if you ask me.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Mist curled off the filthy water. Above us, almost lost in the gloom, was a
                        ceiling of
                        stalactites. Ahead, the far shore glimmered with greenish light, the color of poison. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/18-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Panic closed up my throat. What was I doing here? These people around me…they
                        were dead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth grabbed hold of my hand. Under normal circumstances, this would’ve
                        embarrassed me, but
                        I understood how she felt. She wanted reassurance that somebody else was alive on this boat.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I found myself muttering a prayer, though I wasn’t quite sure who I was praying
                        to. Down here,
                        only one god mattered, and he was the one I had come to confront. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The shoreline of the Underworld came into view. Craggy rocks and black volcanic
                        sand stretched
                        inland about a hundred yards to the base of a high stone wall, which marched off in either
                        direction as far as
                        we could see. A sound came from somewhere nearby in the green gloom, echoing off the stones—the
                        howl of a large
                        animal. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Old Three-Face is hungry,” Charon said. His smile turned skeletal in the
                        greenish light. “Bad
                        luck for you, godlings.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bottom of our boat slid onto the black sand. The dead began to disembark. A
                        woman holding a
                        little girl’s hand. An old man and an old woman hobbling along arm in arm. A boy no older than I
                        was, shuffling
                        silently along in his gray robe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Charon said, “I’d wish you luck, mate, but there isn’t any down here. Mind you,
                        don’t forget to
                        mention my pay raise.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He counted our golden coins into his pouch, then took up his pole. He warbled
                        something that
                        sounded like a Barry Manilow song as he ferried the empty barge back across the river. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">We followed the spirits up a well-worn path. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I’m not sure what I was expecting—Pearly Gates, or a big black portcullis, or
                        something. But
                        the entrance to the Underworld looked like a cross between airport security and the Jersey
                        Turnpike. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There were three separate entrances under one huge black archway that said
                        <small class="calibre4">YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EREBUS</small>. Each entrance had a pass-through
                        metal detector with
                        security cameras mounted on top. Beyond this were tollbooths manned by black-robed ghouls like
                        Charon.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The howling of the hungry animal was really loud now, but I couldn’t see where
                        it was coming
                        from. The three-headed dog, Cerberus, who was supposed to guard Hades’s door, was nowhere to be
                        seen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The dead queued up in the three lines, two marked <small
                            class="calibre4">ATTENDANT ON
                            DUTY</small>, and one marked <small class="calibre4">EZ DEATH</small>. The <small
                            class="calibre4">EZ
                            DEATH</small> line was moving right along. The other two were crawling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What do you figure?” I asked Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The fast line must go straight to the Asphodel Fields,” she said. “No contest.
                        They don’t want
                        to risk judgment from the court, because it might go against them.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There’s a court for dead people?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah. Three judges. They switch around who sits on the bench. King Minos,
                        Thomas Jefferson,
                        Shakespeare—people like that. Sometimes they look at a life and decide that person needs a
                        special reward—the
                        Fields of Elysium. Sometimes they decide on punishment. But most people, well, they just lived.
                        Nothing special,
                        good or bad. So they go to the Asphodel Fields.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And do what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover said, “Imagine standing in a wheat field in Kansas. Forever.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Harsh,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not as harsh as that,” Grover muttered. “Look.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A couple of black-robed ghouls had pulled aside one spirit and were frisking
                        him at the
                        security desk. The face of the dead man looked vaguely familiar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s that preacher who made the news, remember?” Grover asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, yeah.” I did remember now. We’d seen him on TV a couple of times at the
                        Yancy Academy
                        dorm. He was this annoying televangelist from upstate New York who’d raised millions of dollars
                        for orphanages
                        and then got caught spending the money on stuff for his mansion, like gold-plated toilet seats,
                        and an indoor
                        putt-putt golf course. He’d died in a police chase when his “Lamborghini for the Lord” went off
                        a cliff. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “What’re they doing to him?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Special punishment from Hades,” Grover guessed. “The really bad people get his
                        personal
                        attention as soon as they arrive. The Fur—the Kindly Ones will set up an eternal torture for
                        him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The thought of the Furies made me shudder. I realized I was in their home
                        territory now. Old
                        Mrs. Dodds would be licking her lips with anticipation. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But if he’s a preacher,” I said, “and he believes in a different hell.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shrugged. “Who says he’s seeing this place the way we’re seeing it?
                        Humans see what they
                        want to see. You’re very stubborn—er, persistent, that way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We got closer to the gates. The howling was so loud now it shook the ground at
                        my feet, but I
                        still couldn’t figure out where it was coming from. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then, about fifty feet in front of us, the green mist shimmered. Standing just
                        where the path
                        split into three lanes was an enormous shadowy monster. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hadn’t seen it before because it was half transparent, like the dead. Until
                        it moved, it
                        blended with whatever was behind it. Only its eyes and teeth looked solid. And it was staring
                        straight at me.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My jaw hung open. All I could think to say was, “He’s a Rottweiler.” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/18-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I’d always imagined Cerberus as a big black mastiff. But he was obviously a
                        purebred
                        Rottweiler, except of course that he was twice the size of a woolly mammoth, mostly invisible,
                        and had three
                        heads. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The dead walked right up to him—no fear at all. The <small
                            class="calibre4">ATTENDANT ON
                            DUTY</small> lines parted on either side of him. The <small class="calibre4">EZ
                            DEATH</small> spirits walked
                        right between his front paws and under his belly, which they could do without even crouching.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m starting to see him better,” I muttered. “Why is that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I think…” Annabeth moistened her lips. “I’m afraid it’s because we’re getting
                        closer to being
                        dead.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The dog’s middle head craned toward us. It sniffed the air and growled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It can smell the living,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But that’s okay,” Grover said, trembling next to me. “Because we have a plan.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Right,” Annabeth said. I’d never heard her voice sound quite so small. “A
                        plan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We moved toward the monster. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The middle head snarled at us, then barked so loud my eyeballs rattled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Can you understand it?” I asked Grover. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh yeah,” he said. “I can understand it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s it saying?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t think humans have a four-letter word that translates, exactly.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took the big stick out of my backpack—a bedpost I’d broken off Crusty’s
                        Safari Deluxe floor
                        model. I held it up, and tried to channel happy dog thoughts toward Cerberus—Alpo commercials,
                        cute little
                        puppies, fire hydrants. I tried to smile, like I wasn’t about to die. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, Big Fella,” I called up. “I bet they don’t play with you much.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“GROWWWLLLL!”</em> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good boy,” I said weakly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I waved the stick. The dog’s middle head followed the movement. The other two
                        heads trained
                        their eyes on me, completely ignoring the spirits. I had Cerberus’s undivided attention. I
                        wasn’t sure that was
                        a good thing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fetch!” I threw the stick into the gloom, a good solid throw. I heard it go
                        <em class="calibre5">ker-sploosh </em>in the River Styx.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Cerberus glared at me, unimpressed. His eyes were baleful and cold. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">So much for the plan. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Cerberus was now making a new kind of growl, deeper down in his three throats.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um,” Grover said. “Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I just thought you’d want to know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Cerberus? He’s saying we’ve got ten seconds to pray to the god of our choice.
                        After
                        that…well…he’s hungry.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait!” Annabeth said. She started rifling through her pack. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Uh-oh, I thought. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Five seconds,” Grover said. “Do we run now?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth produced a red rubber ball the size of a grapefruit. It was labeled
                        <small class="calibre4">WATERLAND, DENVER, CO.</small> Before I could stop her, she raised the
                        ball and marched
                        straight up to Cerberus.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She shouted, “See the ball? You want the ball, Cerberus? Sit!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Cerberus looked as stunned as we were. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">All three of his heads cocked sideways. Six nostrils dilated. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sit!” Annabeth called again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was sure that any moment she would become the world’s largest Milkbone dog
                        biscuit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But instead, Cerberus licked his three sets of lips, shifted on his haunches,
                        and sat,
                        immediately crushing a dozen spirits who’d been passing underneath him in the <small
                            class="calibre4">EZ
                            DEATH</small> line. The spirits made muffled hisses as they dissipated, like the air let out
                        of tires. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “Good boy!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She threw Cerberus the ball. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He caught it in his middle mouth. It was barely big enough for him to chew, and
                        the other heads
                        started snapping at the middle, trying to get the new toy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Drop it!” Annabeth ordered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Cerberus’s heads stopped fighting and looked at her. The ball was wedged
                        between two of his
                        teeth like a tiny piece of gum. He made a loud, scary whimper, then dropped the ball, now slimy
                        and bitten
                        nearly in half, at Annabeth’s feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good boy.” She picked up the ball, ignoring the monster spit all over it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She turned toward us. “Go now. <small class="calibre4">EZ DEATH</small>
                        line—it’s faster.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now!” She ordered, in the same tone she was using on the dog. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and I inched forward warily. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Cerberus started to growl. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stay!” Annabeth ordered the monster. “If you want the ball, stay!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Cerberus whimpered, but he stayed where he was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What about you?” I asked Annabeth as we passed her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know what I’m doing, Percy,” she muttered. “At least, I’m pretty sure.…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and I walked between the monster’s legs. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Please, Annabeth, I prayed. Don’t tell him to sit again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We made it through. Cerberus wasn’t any less scary-looking from the back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “Good dog!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She held up the tattered red ball, and probably came to the same conclusion I
                        did—if she
                        rewarded Cerberus, there’d be nothing left for another trick. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She threw the ball anyway. The monster’s left mouth immediately snatched it up,
                        only to be
                        attacked by the middle head, while the right head moaned in protest. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">While the monster was distracted, Annabeth walked briskly under its belly and
                        joined us at the
                        metal detector. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How did you do that?” I asked her, amazed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Obedience school,” she said breathlessly, and I was surprised to see there
                        were tears in her
                        eyes. “When I was little, at my dad’s house, we had a Doberman.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Never mind that,” Grover said, tugging at my shirt. “Come on!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We were about to bolt through the <small class="calibre4">EZ DEATH</small> line
                        when Cerberus
                        moaned pitifully from all three mouths. Annabeth stopped. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She turned to face the dog, which had done a one-eighty to look at us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Cerberus panted expectantly, the tiny red ball in pieces in a puddle of drool
                        at its feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good boy,” Annabeth said, but her voice sounded melancholy and uncertain. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The monster’s heads turned sideways, as if worried about her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll bring you another ball soon,” Annabeth promised faintly. “Would you like
                        that?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The monster whimpered. I didn’t need to speak dog to know Cerberus was still
                        waiting for the
                        ball. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good dog. I’ll come visit you soon. I—I promise.” Annabeth turned to us.
                        “Let’s go.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover and I pushed through the metal detector, which immediately screamed and
                        set off flashing
                        red lights. “Unauthorized possessions! Magic detected!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Cerberus started to bark. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We burst through the <small class="calibre4">EZ DEATH</small> gate, which
                        started even more
                        alarms blaring, and raced into the Underworld. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A few minutes later, we were hiding, out of breath, in the rotten trunk of an
                        immense black
                        tree as security ghouls scuttled past, yelling for backup from the Furies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover murmured, “Well, Percy, what have we learned today?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That three-headed dogs prefer red rubber balls over sticks?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” Grover told me. “We’ve learned that your plans really, really bite!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t sure about that. I thought maybe Annabeth and I had both had the right
                        idea. Even here
                        in the Underworld, everybody—even monsters—needed a little attention once in a while. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about that as we waited for the ghouls to pass. I pretended not to
                        see Annabeth wipe
                        a tear from her cheek as she listened to the mournful keening of Cerberus in the distance,
                        longing for his new
                        friend. </p>

                        a football
                        field packed with a million fans. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Now imagine a field a million times that big, packed with people, and imagine
                        the electricity
                        has gone out, and there is no noise, no light, no beach ball bouncing around over the crowd.
                        Something tragic
                        has happened backstage. Whispering masses of people are just milling around in the shadows,
                        waiting for a
                        concert that will never start. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">If you can picture that, you have a pretty good idea what the Fields of
                        Asphodel looked like.
                        The black grass had been trampled by eons of dead feet. A warm, moist wind blew like the breath
                        of a swamp.
                        Black trees—Grover told me they were poplars—grew in clumps here and there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The cavern ceiling was so high above us it might’ve been a bank of storm
                        clouds, except for the
                        stalactites, which glowed faint gray and looked wickedly pointed. I tried not to imagine they’d
                        fall on us at
                        any moment, but dotted around the fields were several that had fallen and impaled themselves in
                        the black grass.
                        I guess the dead didn’t have to worry about little hazards like being speared by stalactites the
                        size of booster
                        rockets. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth, Grover, and I tried to blend into the crowd, keeping an eye out for
                        security ghouls.
                        I couldn’t help looking for familiar faces among the spirits of Asphodel, but the dead are hard
                        to look at.
                        Their faces shimmer. They all look slightly angry or confused. They will come up to you and
                        speak, but their
                        voices sound like chatter, like bats twittering. Once they realize you can’t understand them,
                        they frown and
                        move away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The dead aren’t scary. They’re just sad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We crept along, following the line of new arrivals that snaked from the main
                        gates toward a
                        black-tented pavilion with a banner that read: </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"> </p>
                    <p class="center"><small class="calibre4">JUDGMENTS FOR ELYSIUM AND ETERNAL DAMNATION</small><br
                            class="calibre1" />
                        Welcome, Newly Deceased! </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"> </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Out the back of the tent came two much smaller lines. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">To the left, spirits flanked by security ghouls were marched down a rocky path
                        toward the
                        Fields of Punishment, which glowed and smoked in the distance, a vast, cracked wasteland with
                        rivers of lava and
                        minefields and miles of barbed wire separating the different torture areas. Even from far away,
                        I could see
                        people being chased by hellhounds, burned at the stake, forced to run naked through cactus
                        patches or listen to
                        opera music. I could just make out a tiny hill, with the ant-size figure of Sisyphus struggling
                        to move his
                        boulder to the top. And I saw worse tortures, too—things I don’t want to describe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The line coming from the right side of the judgment pavilion was much better.
                        This one led down
                        toward a small valley surrounded by walls—a gated community, which seemed to be the only happy
                        part of the
                        Underworld. Beyond the security gate were neighborhoods of beautiful houses from every time
                        period in history,
                        Roman villas and medieval castles and Victorian mansions. Silver and gold flowers bloomed on the
                        lawns. The
                        grass rippled in rainbow colors. I could hear laughter and smell barbecue cooking. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Elysium. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the middle of that valley was a glittering blue lake, with three small
                        islands like a
                        vacation resort in the Bahamas. The Isles of the Blest, for people who had chosen to be reborn
                        three times, and
                        three times achieved Elysium. Immediately I knew that’s where I wanted to go when I died. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s what it’s all about,” Annabeth said, like she was reading my thoughts.
                        “That’s the
                        place for heroes.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But I thought of how few people there were in Elysium, how tiny it was compared
                        to the Fields
                        of Asphodel or even the Fields of Punishment. So few people did good in their lives. It was
                        depressing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We left the judgment pavilion and moved deeper into the Asphodel Fields. It got
                        darker. The
                        colors faded from our clothes. The crowds of chattering spirits began to thin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After a few miles of walking, we began to hear a familiar screech in the
                        distance. Looming on
                        the horizon was a palace of glittering black obsidian. Above the parapets swirled three dark
                        batlike creatures:
                        the Furies. I got the feeling they were waiting for us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I suppose it’s too late to turn back,” Grover said wistfully. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll be okay.” I tried to sound confident. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Maybe we should search some of the other places first,” Grover suggested.
                        “Like, Elysium, for
                        instance…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on, goat boy.” Annabeth grabbed his arm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover yelped. His sneakers sprouted wings and his legs shot forward, pulling
                        him away from
                        Annabeth. He landed flat on his back in the grass. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover,” Annabeth chided. “Stop messing around.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But I didn’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He yelped again. His shoes were flapping like crazy now. They levitated off the
                        ground and
                        started dragging him away from us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">“Maia!” </em>he yelled, but the magic word seemed to have
                        no effect. <em class="calibre5">“Maia</em>, already! Nine-one-one! Help!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got over being stunned and made a grab for Grover’s hand, but too late. He
                        was picking up
                        speed, skidding downhill like a bobsled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We ran after him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth shouted, “Untie the shoes!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was a smart idea, but I guess it’s not so easy when your shoes are pulling
                        you along
                        feetfirst at full speed. Grover tried to sit up, but he couldn’t get close to the laces. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We kept after him, trying to keep him in sight as he zipped between the legs of
                        spirits who
                        chattered at him in annoyance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was sure Grover was going to barrel straight through the gates of Hades’s
                        palace, but his
                        shoes veered sharply to the right and dragged him in the opposite direction. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The slope got steeper. Grover picked up speed. Annabeth and I had to sprint to
                        keep up. The
                        cavern walls narrowed on either side, and I realized we’d entered some kind of side tunnel. No
                        black grass or
                        trees now, just rock underfoot, and the dim light of the stalactites above. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover!” I yelled, my voice echoing. “Hold on to something!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What?” he yelled back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was grabbing at gravel, but there was nothing big enough to slow him down.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The tunnel got darker and colder. The hairs on my arms bristled. It smelled
                        evil down here. It
                        made me think of things I shouldn’t even know about—blood spilled on an ancient stone altar, the
                        foul breath of
                        a murderer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then I saw what was ahead of us, and I stopped dead in my tracks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The tunnel widened into a huge dark cavern, and in the middle was a chasm the
                        size of a city
                        block. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was sliding straight toward the edge. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Come on, Percy!” Annabeth yelled, tugging at my wrist. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But that’s—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know!” she shouted. “The place you described in your dream! But Grover’s
                        going to fall if we
                        don’t catch him.” She was right, of course. Grover’s predicament got me moving again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was yelling, clawing at the ground, but the winged shoes kept dragging him
                        toward the pit,
                        and it didn’t look like we could possibly get to him in time. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/19-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">What saved him were his hooves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The flying sneakers had always been a loose fit on him, and finally Grover hit
                        a big rock and
                        the left shoe came flying off. It sped into the darkness, down into the chasm. The right shoe
                        kept tugging him
                        along, but not as fast. Grover was able to slow himself down by grabbing on to the big rock and
                        using it like an
                        anchor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was ten feet from the edge of the pit when we caught him and hauled him back
                        up the slope.
                        The other winged shoe tugged itself off, circled around us angrily and kicked our heads in
                        protest before flying
                        off into the chasm to join its twin. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We all collapsed, exhausted, on the obsidian gravel. My limbs felt like lead.
                        Even my backpack
                        seemed heavier, as if somebody had filled it with rocks. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover was scratched up pretty bad. His hands were bleeding. His eyes had gone
                        slit-pupiled,
                        goat style, the way they did whenever he was terrified. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know how…” he panted. “I didn’t…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wait,” I said. “Listen.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I heard something—a deep whisper in the darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Another few seconds, and Annabeth said, “Percy, this place—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Shh.” I stood. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The sound was getting louder, a muttering, evil voice from far, far below us.
                        Coming from the
                        pit. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover sat up. “Wh—what’s that noise?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth heard it too, now. I could see it in her eyes. “Tartarus. The entrance
                        to Tartarus.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I uncapped Anaklusmos. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The bronze sword expanded, gleaming in the darkness, and the evil voice seemed
                        to falter, just
                        for a moment, before resuming its chant. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could almost make out words now, ancient, ancient words, older even than
                        Greek. As if…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Magic,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We have to get out of here,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Together, we dragged Grover to his hooves and started back up the tunnel. My
                        legs wouldn’t move
                        fast enough. My backpack weighed me down. The voice got louder and angrier behind us, and we
                        broke into a run.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Not a moment too soon. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A cold blast of wind pulled at our backs, as if the entire pit were inhaling.
                        For a terrifying
                        moment, I lost ground, my feet slipping in the gravel. If we’d been any closer to the edge, we
                        would’ve been
                        sucked in. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We kept struggling forward, and finally reached the top of the tunnel, where
                        the cavern widened
                        out into the Fields of Asphodel. The wind died. A wail of outrage echoed from deep in the
                        tunnel. Something was
                        not happy we’d gotten away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What <em class="calibre5">was </em>that?” Grover panted, when we’d collapsed
                        in the relative
                        safety of a black poplar grove. “One of Hades’s pets?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and I looked at each other. I could tell she was nursing an idea,
                        probably the same
                        one she’d gotten during the taxi ride to L.A., but she was too scared to share it. That was
                        enough to terrify
                        me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I capped my sword, put the pen back in my pocket. “Let’s keep going.” I looked
                        at Grover. “Can
                        you walk?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He swallowed. “Yeah, sure. I never liked those shoes, anyway.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He tried to sound brave about it, but he was trembling as badly as Annabeth and
                        I were.
                        Whatever was in that pit was nobody’s pet. It was unspeakably old and powerful. Even Echidna
                        hadn’t given me
                        that feeling. I was almost relieved to turn my back on that tunnel and head toward the palace of
                        Hades. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">Almost. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The Furies circled the parapets, high in the gloom. The outer walls of the
                        fortress glittered
                        black, and the two-story-tall bronze gates stood wide open. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Up close, I saw that the engravings on the gates were scenes of death. Some
                        were from modern
                        times—an atomic bomb exploding over a city, a trench filled with gas mask– wearing soldiers, a
                        line of African
                        famine victims waiting with empty bowls—but all of them looked as if they’d been etched into the
                        bronze
                        thousands of years ago. I wondered if I was looking at prophecies that had come true. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Inside the courtyard was the strangest garden I’d ever seen. Multicolored
                        mushrooms, poisonous
                        shrubs, and weird luminous plants grew without sunlight. Precious jewels made up for the lack of
                        flowers, piles
                        of rubies as big as my fist, clumps of raw diamonds. Standing here and there like frozen party
                        guests were
                        Medusa’s garden statues—petrified children, satyrs, and centaurs—all smiling grotesquely. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the center of the garden was an orchard of pomegranate trees, their orange
                        blooms neon
                        bright in the dark. “The garden of Persephone,” Annabeth said. “Keep walking.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I understood why she wanted to move on. The tart smell of those pomegranates
                        was almost
                        overwhelming. I had a sudden desire to eat them, but then I remembered the story of Persephone.
                        One bite of
                        Underworld food, and we would never be able to leave. I pulled Grover away to keep him from
                        picking a big juicy
                        one. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We walked up the steps of the palace, between black columns, through a black
                        marble portico,
                        and into the house of Hades. The entry hall had a polished bronze floor, which seemed to boil in
                        the reflected
                        torchlight. There was no ceiling, just the cavern roof, far above. I guess they never had to
                        worry about rain
                        down here. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Every side doorway was guarded by a skeleton in military gear. Some wore Greek
                        armor, some
                        British redcoat uniforms, some camouflage with tattered American flags on the shoulders. They
                        carried spears or
                        muskets or M-16s. None of them bothered us, but their hollow eye sockets followed us as we
                        walked down the hall,
                        toward the big set of doors at the opposite end. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Two U.S. Marine skeletons guarded the doors. They grinned down at us,
                        rocket-propelled grenade
                        launchers held across their chests. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You know,” Grover mumbled, “I bet Hades doesn’t have trouble with door-to-door
                        salesmen.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My backpack weighed a ton now. I couldn’t figure out why. I wanted to open it,
                        check to see if
                        I had somehow picked up a stray bowling ball, but this wasn’t the time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, guys,” I said. “I suppose we should…knock?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A hot wind blew down the corridor, and the doors swung open. The guards stepped
                        aside. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I guess that means <em class="calibre5">entrez-vous,</em>” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The room inside looked just like in my dream, except this time the throne of
                        Hades was
                        occupied. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was the third god I’d met, but the first who really struck me as godlike.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was at least ten feet tall, for one thing, and dressed in black silk robes
                        and a crown of
                        braided gold. His skin was albino white, his hair shoulder-length and jet black. He wasn’t
                        bulked up like Ares,
                        but he radiated power. He lounged on his throne of fused human bones, looking lithe, graceful,
                        and dangerous as
                        a panther. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/19-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I immediately felt like he should be giving the orders. He knew more than I
                        did. He should be
                        my master. Then I told myself to snap out of it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hades’s aura was affecting me, just as Ares’s had. The Lord of the Dead
                        resembled pictures I’d
                        seen of Adolph Hitler, or Napoleon, or the terrorist leaders who direct suicide bombers. Hades
                        had the same
                        intense eyes, the same kind of mesmerizing, evil charisma. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You are brave to come here, Son of Poseidon,” he said in an oily voice. “After
                        what you have
                        done to me, very brave indeed. Or perhaps you are simply very foolish.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Numbness crept into my joints, tempting me to lie down and just take a little
                        nap at Hades’s
                        feet. Curl up here and sleep forever. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I fought the feeling and stepped forward. I knew what I had to say. “Lord and
                        Uncle, I come
                        with two requests.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hades raised an eyebrow. When he sat forward in his throne, shadowy faces
                        appeared in the folds
                        of his black robes, faces of torment, as if the garment were stitched of trapped souls from the
                        Fields of
                        Punishment, trying to get out. The ADHD part of me wondered, off-task, whether the rest of his
                        clothes were made
                        the same way. What horrible things would you have to do in your life to get woven into Hades’s
                        underwear? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Only two requests?” Hades said. “Arrogant child. As if you have not already
                        taken enough.
                        Speak, then. It amuses me not to strike you dead yet.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I swallowed. This was going about as well as I’d feared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I glanced at the empty, smaller throne next to Hades’s. It was shaped like a
                        black flower,
                        gilded with gold. I wished Queen Persephone were here. I recalled something in the myths about
                        how she could
                        calm her husband’s moods. But it was summer. Of course, Persephone would be above in the world
                        of light with her
                        mother, the goddess of agriculture, Demeter. Her visits, not the tilt of the planet, create the
                        seasons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth cleared her throat. Her finger prodded me in the back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Lord Hades,” I said. “Look, sir, there can’t be a war among the gods. It would
                        be…bad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Really bad,” Grover added helpfully. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Return Zeus’s master bolt to me,” I said. “Please, sir. Let me carry it to
                        Olympus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hades’s eyes grew dangerously bright. “You dare keep up this pretense, after
                        what you have
                        done?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I glanced back at my friends. They looked as confused as I was. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um…Uncle,” I said. “You keep saying ‘after what you’ve done.’ What exactly
                        have I done?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The throne room shook with a tremor so strong, they probably felt it upstairs
                        in Los Angeles.
                        Debris fell from the cavern ceiling. Doors burst open all along the walls, and skeletal warriors
                        marched in,
                        hundreds of them, from every time period and nation in Western civilization. They lined the
                        perimeter of the
                        room, blocking the exits. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hades bellowed, “Do you think I <em class="calibre5">want </em>war, godling?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to say, <em class="calibre5">Well, these guys don’t look like peace
                            activists</em>.
                        But I thought that might be a dangerous answer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You are the Lord of the Dead,” I said carefully. “A war would expand your
                        kingdom, right?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A typical thing for my brothers to say! Do you think I need more subjects? Did
                        you not see the
                        sprawl of the Asphodel Fields?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Have you any idea how much my kingdom has swollen in this past century alone,
                        how many
                        subdivisions I’ve had to open?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I opened my mouth to respond, but Hades was on a roll now. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“More security ghouls,” he moaned. “Traffic problems at the judgment pavilion.
                        Double overtime
                        for the staff. I used to be a rich god, Percy Jackson. I control all the precious metals under
                        the earth. But my
                        expenses!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Charon wants a pay raise,” I blurted, just remembering the fact. As soon as I
                        said it, I
                        wished I could sew up my mouth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t get me started on Charon!” Hades yelled. “He’s been impossible ever
                        since he discovered
                        Italian suits! Problems everywhere, and I’ve got to handle all of them personally. The commute
                        time alone from
                        the palace to the gates is enough to drive me insane! And the dead just keep arriving. <em
                            class="calibre5">No</em>, godling. I need no help getting subjects! <em class="calibre5">I
                        </em>did not ask
                        for this war.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But you took Zeus’s master bolt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Lies!” More rumbling. Hades rose from his throne, towering to the height of a
                        football
                        goalpost. “Your father may fool Zeus, boy, but I am not so stupid. I see his plan.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“His plan?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">You </em>were the thief on the winter solstice,” he said.
                        “Your father
                        thought to keep you his little secret. He directed you into the throne room on Olympus. You took
                        the master bolt
                        <em class="calibre5">and </em>my helm. Had I not sent my Fury to discover you at Yancy Academy,
                        Poseidon might
                        have succeeded in hiding his scheme to start a war. But now you have been forced into the open.
                        You will be
                        exposed as Poseidon’s thief, and I will have my helm back!”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But…” Annabeth spoke. I could tell her mind was going a million miles an hour.
                        “Lord Hades,
                        your helm of darkness is missing, too?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Do not play innocent with me, girl. You and the satyr have been helping this
                        hero—coming here
                        to threaten me in Poseidon’s name, no doubt—to bring me an ultimatum. Does Poseidon think I can
                        be blackmailed
                        into supporting him?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” I said. “Poseidon didn’t—I didn’t—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have said nothing of the helm’s disappearance,” Hades snarled, “because I
                        had no illusions
                        that anyone on Olympus would offer me the slightest justice, the slightest help. I can ill
                        afford for word to
                        get out that my most powerful weapon of fear is missing. So I searched for you myself, and when
                        it was clear you
                        were coming to me to deliver your threat, I did not try to stop you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You didn’t try to stop us? But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Return my helm now, or I will stop death,” Hades threatened. “That is my
                        counterproposal. I
                        will open the earth and have the dead pour back into the world. I will make your lands a
                        nightmare. And you,
                        Percy Jackson—<em class="calibre5">your </em>skeleton will lead my army out of Hades.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The skeletal soldiers all took one step forward, making their weapons ready.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">At that point, I probably should have been terrified. The strange thing was, I
                        felt offended.
                        Nothing gets me angrier than being accused of something I didn’t do. I’ve had a lot of
                        experience with that.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re as bad as Zeus,” I said. “You think I stole from you? That’s why you
                        sent the Furies
                        after me?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Of course,” Hades said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And the other monsters?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hades curled his lip. “I had nothing to do with them. I wanted no quick death
                        for you—I wanted
                        you brought before me alive so you might face every torture in the Fields of Punishment. Why do
                        you think I let
                        you enter my kingdom so easily?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Easily?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Return my property!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But I don’t have your helm. I came for the master bolt.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Which you already possess!” Hades shouted. “You came here with it, little
                        fool, thinking you
                        could threaten me!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But I didn’t!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Open your pack, then.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A horrible feeling struck me. The weight in my backpack, like a bowling ball.
                        It couldn’t be.…
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I slung it off my shoulder and unzipped it. Inside was a two-foot-long metal
                        cylinder, spiked
                        on both ends, humming with energy. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Annabeth said. “How—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I—I don’t know. I don’t understand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You heroes are always the same,” Hades said. “Your pride makes you foolish,
                        thinking you could
                        bring such a weapon before me. I did not ask for Zeus’s master bolt, but since it is here, you
                        will yield it to
                        me. I am sure it will make an excellent bargaining tool. And now…my helm. Where is it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was speechless. I had no helm. I had no idea how the master bolt had gotten
                        into my backpack.
                        I wanted to think Hades was pulling some kind of trick. Hades was the bad guy. But suddenly the
                        world turned
                        sideways. I realized I’d been played with. Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades had been set at each
                        other’s throats by
                        someone else. The master bolt had been in the backpack, and I’d gotten the backpack from…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Lord Hades, wait,” I said. “This is all a mistake.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A mistake?” Hades roared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The skeletons aimed their weapons. From high above, there was a fluttering of
                        leathery wings,
                        and the three Furies swooped down to perch on the back of their master’s throne. The one with
                        Mrs. Dodds’s face
                        grinned at me eagerly and flicked her whip. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There is no mistake,” Hades said. “I know why you have come—I know the <em
                            class="calibre5">real </em>reason you brought the bolt. You came to bargain for <em
                            class="calibre5">her</em>.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hades loosed a ball of gold fire from his palm. It exploded on the steps in
                        front of me, and
                        there was my mother, frozen in a shower of gold, just as she was at the moment when the Minotaur
                        began to
                        squeeze her to death. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t speak. I reached out to touch her, but the light was as hot as a
                        bonfire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes,” Hades said with satisfaction. “I took her. I knew, Percy Jackson, that
                        you would come to
                        bargain with me eventually. Return my helm, and perhaps I will let her go. She is not dead, you
                        know. Not yet.
                        But if you displease me, that will change.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about the pearls in my pocket. Maybe they could get me out of this.
                        If I could just
                        get my mom free…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ah, the pearls,” Hades said, and my blood froze. “Yes, my brother and his
                        little tricks. Bring
                        them forth, Percy Jackson.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My hand moved against my will and brought out the pearls. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Only three,” Hades said. “What a shame. You do realize each only protects a
                        single person. Try
                        to take your mother, then, little godling. And which of your friends will you leave behind to
                        spend eternity
                        with me? Go on. Choose. Or give me the backpack and accept my terms.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at Annabeth and Grover. Their faces were grim. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We were tricked,” I told them. “Set up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, but why?” Annabeth asked. “And the voice in the pit—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know yet,” I said. “But I intend to ask.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Decide, boy!” Hades yelled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy.” Grover put his hand on my shoulder. “You can’t give him the bolt.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Leave me here,” he said. “Use the third pearl on your mom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m a satyr,” Grover said. “We don’t have souls like humans do. He can torture
                        me until I die,
                        but he won’t get me forever. I’ll just be reincarnated as a flower or something. It’s the best
                        way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No.” Annabeth drew her bronze knife. “You two go on. Grover, you have to
                        protect Percy. You
                        have to get your searcher’s license and start your quest for Pan. Get his mom out of here. I’ll
                        cover you. I
                        plan to go down fighting.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No way,” Grover said. “I’m staying behind.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Think again, goat boy,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Stop it, both of you!” I felt like my heart was being ripped in two. They had
                        both been with
                        me through so much. I remembered Grover dive-bombing Medusa in the statue garden, and Annabeth
                        saving us from
                        Cerberus; we’d survived Hephaestus’s Waterland ride, the St. Louis Arch, the Lotus Casino. I had
                        spent thousands
                        of miles worried that I’d be betrayed by a friend, but these friends would never do that. They
                        had done nothing
                        but save me, over and over, and now they wanted to sacrifice their lives for my mom. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I know what to do,” I said. “Take these.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I handed them each a pearl. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “But, Percy…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned and faced my mother. I desperately wanted to sacrifice myself and use
                        the last pearl
                        on her, but I knew what she would say. She would never allow it. I had to get the bolt back to
                        Olympus and tell
                        Zeus the truth. I had to stop the war. She would never forgive me if I saved her instead. I
                        thought about the
                        prophecy made at Half-Blood Hill, what seemed like a million years ago. <em class="calibre5">You
                            will fail to
                            save what matters most in the end. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m sorry,” I told her. “I’ll be back. I’ll find a way.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The smug look on Hades’s face faded. He said, “Godling…?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll find your helm, Uncle,” I told him. “I’ll return it. Remember about
                        Charon’s pay raise.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Do not defy me—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And it wouldn’t hurt to play with Cerberus once in a while. He likes red
                        rubber balls.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy Jackson, you will not—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shouted, “Now, guys!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We smashed the pearls at our feet. For a scary moment, nothing happened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Hades yelled, “Destroy them!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The army of skeletons rushed forward, swords out, guns clicking to full
                        automatic. The Furies
                        lunged, their whips bursting into flame. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Just as the skeletons opened fire, the pearl fragments at my feet exploded with
                        a burst of
                        green light and a gust of fresh sea wind. I was encased in a milky white sphere, which was
                        starting to float off
                        the ground. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth and Grover were right behind me. Spears and bullets sparked harmlessly
                        off the pearl
                        bubbles as we floated up. Hades yelled with such rage, the entire fortress shook and I knew it
                        was not going to
                        be a peaceful night in L.A. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Look up!” Grover yelled. “We’re going to crash!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Sure enough, we were racing right toward the stalactites, which I figured would
                        pop our bubbles
                        and skewer us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How do you control these things?” Annabeth shouted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t think you do!” I shouted back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We screamed as the bubbles slammed into the ceiling and…Darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Were we dead? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">No, I could still feel the racing sensation. We were going up, right through
                        solid rock as
                        easily as an air bubble in water. That was the power of the pearls, I realized—<em
                            class="calibre5">What belongs
                            to the sea will always return to the sea. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For a few moments, I couldn’t see anything outside the smooth walls of my
                        sphere, then my pearl
                        broke through on the ocean floor. The two other milky spheres, Annabeth and Grover, kept pace
                        with me as we
                        soared upward through the water. And<em class="calibre5">—ker-blam! </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We exploded on the surface, in the middle of the Santa Monica Bay, knocking a
                        surfer off his
                        board with an indignant, “Dude!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I grabbed Grover and hauled him over to a life buoy. I caught Annabeth and
                        dragged her over
                        too. A curious shark was circling us, a great white about eleven feet long. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I said, “Beat it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The shark turned and raced away. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The surfer screamed something about bad mushrooms and paddled away from us as
                        fast as he could.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Somehow, I knew what time it was: early morning, June 21, the day of the summer
                        solstice. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the distance, Los Angeles was on fire, plumes of smoke rising from
                        neighborhoods all over
                        the city. There had been an earthquake, all right, and it was Hades’s fault. He was probably
                        sending an army of
                        the dead after me right now. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But at the moment, the Underworld wasn’t my biggest problem. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I had to get to shore. I had to get Zeus’s thunderbolt back to Olympus. Most of
                        all, I had to
                        have a serious conversation with the god who’d tricked me. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">A</span> Coast Guard boat picked us up, but they were too
                        busy to keep us
                        for long, or to wonder how three kids in street clothes had gotten out into the middle of the
                        bay. There was a
                        disaster to mop up. Their radios were jammed with distress calls. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They dropped us off at the Santa Monica Pier with towels around our shoulders
                        and water bottles
                        that said <small class="calibre4">I’M A JUNIOR COAST GUARD!</small> and sped off to save more
                        people. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Our clothes were sopping wet, even mine. When the Coast Guard boat had
                        appeared, I’d silently
                        prayed they wouldn’t pick me out of the water and find me perfectly dry, which might’ve raised
                        some eyebrows. So
                        I’d willed myself to get soaked. Sure enough, my usual waterproof magic had abandoned me. I was
                        also barefoot,
                        because I’d given my shoes to Grover. Better the Coast Guard wonder why one of us was barefoot
                        than wonder why
                        one of us had hooves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After reaching dry land, we stumbled down the beach, watching the city burn
                        against a beautiful
                        sunrise. I felt as if I’d just come back from the dead—which I had. My backpack was heavy with
                        Zeus’s master
                        bolt. My heart was even heavier from seeing my mother. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t believe it,” Annabeth said. “We went all that way—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It was a trick,” I said. “A strategy worthy of Athena.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey,” she warned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You get it, don’t you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She dropped her eyes, her anger fading. “Yeah. I get it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well, I don’t!” Grover complained. “Would somebody—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy…” Annabeth said. “I’m sorry about your mother. I’m so sorry.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I pretended not to hear her. If I talked about my mother, I was going to start
                        crying like a
                        little kid. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The prophecy was right,” I said. “‘You shall go west and face the god who has
                        turned.’ But it
                        wasn’t Hades. Hades didn’t want war among the Big Three. Someone else pulled off the theft.
                        Someone stole Zeus’s
                        master bolt, and Hades’s helm, and framed me because I’m Poseidon’s kid. Poseidon will get
                        blamed by both sides.
                        By sundown today, there will be a three-way war. And I’ll have caused it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover shook his head, mystified. “But who would be that sneaky? Who would want
                        war that bad?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stopped in my tracks, looking down the beach. “Gee, let me think.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There he was, waiting for us, in his black leather duster and his sunglasses,
                        an aluminum
                        baseball bat propped on his shoulder. His motorcycle rumbled beside him, its headlight turning
                        the sand red.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/20-1.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, kid,” Ares said, seeming genuinely pleased to see me. “You were supposed
                        to die.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You tricked me,” I said. “<em class="calibre5">You </em>stole the helm and the
                        master bolt.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares grinned. “Well, now, I didn’t steal them personally. Gods taking each
                        other’s symbols of
                        power—that’s a big no-no. But you’re not the only hero in the world who can run errands.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who did you use? Clarisse? She was there at the winter solstice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The idea seemed to amuse him. “Doesn’t matter. The point is, kid, you’re
                        impeding the war
                        effort. See, you’ve got to die in the Underworld. Then Old Seaweed will be mad at Hades for
                        killing you. Corpse
                        Breath will have Zeus’s master bolt, so Zeus’ll be mad at <em class="calibre5">him</em>. And
                        Hades is still
                        looking for this…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">From his pocket he took out a ski cap—the kind bank robbers wear—and placed it
                        between the
                        handlebars of his bike. Immediately, the cap transformed into an elaborate bronze war helmet.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The helm of darkness,” Grover gasped. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/20-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“Exactly,” Ares said. “Now where was I? Oh yeah, Hades will be mad at both Zeus
                        and Poseidon,
                        because he doesn’t know who took this. Pretty soon, we got a nice little three-way slugfest
                        going.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But they’re your family!” Annabeth protested. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares shrugged. “Best kind of war. Always the bloodiest. Nothing like watching
                        your relatives
                        fight, I always say.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You gave me the backpack in Denver,” I said. “The master bolt was in there the
                        whole time.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes and no,” Ares said. “It’s probably too complicated for your little mortal
                        brain to follow,
                        but the backpack is the master bolt’s sheath, just morphed a bit. The bolt is connected to it,
                        sort of like that
                        sword you got, kid. It always returns to your pocket, right?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wasn’t sure how Ares knew about that, but I guess a god of war had to make it
                        his business to
                        know about weapons. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Anyway,” Ares continued, “I tinkered with the magic a bit, so the bolt would
                        only return to
                        the sheath once you reached the Underworld. You get close to Hades.…Bingo, you got mail. If you
                        died along the
                        way—no loss. I still had the weapon.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But why not just keep the master bolt for yourself ?” I said. “Why send it to
                        Hades?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares got a twitch in his jaw. For a moment, it was almost as if he were
                        listening to another
                        voice, deep inside his head. “Why didn’t I…yeah…with that kind of firepower…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He held the trance for one second…two seconds.…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I exchanged nervous looks with Annabeth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares’s face cleared. “I didn’t want the trouble. Better to have you caught
                        redhanded, holding
                        the thing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re lying,” I said. “Sending the bolt to the Underworld wasn’t your idea,
                        was it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Of course it was!” Smoke drifted up from his sunglasses, as if they were about
                        to catch fire.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You didn’t order the theft,” I guessed. “Someone else sent a hero to steal the
                        two items.
                        Then, when Zeus sent you to hunt him down, you caught the thief. But you didn’t turn him over to
                        Zeus. Something
                        convinced you to let him go. You kept the items until another hero could come along and complete
                        the delivery.
                        That thing in the pit is ordering you around.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I am the god of war! I take orders from no one! I don’t have dreams!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I hesitated. “Who said anything about dreams?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares looked agitated, but he tried to cover it with a smirk. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Let’s get back to the problem at hand, kid. You’re alive. I can’t have you
                        taking that bolt to
                        Olympus. You just might get those hardheaded idiots to listen to you. So I’ve got to kill you.
                        Nothing
                        personal.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He snapped his fingers. The sand exploded at his feet and out charged a wild
                        boar, even larger
                        and uglier than the one whose head hung above the door of cabin seven at Camp Half-Blood. The
                        beast pawed the
                        sand, glaring at me with beady eyes as it lowered its razor-sharp tusks and waited for the
                        command to kill. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/20-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I stepped into the surf. “Fight me yourself, Ares.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He laughed, but I heard a little edge to his laughter…an uneasiness. “You’ve
                        only got one
                        talent, kid, running away. You ran from the Chimera. You ran from the Underworld. You don’t have
                        what it takes.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Scared?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“In your adolescent dreams.” But his sunglasses were starting to melt from the
                        heat of his
                        eyes. “No direct involvement. Sorry, kid. You’re not at my level.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “Percy, run!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The giant boar charged. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But I was done running from monsters. Or Hades, or Ares, or anybody. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As the boar rushed me, I uncapped my pen and sidestepped. Riptide appeared in
                        my hands. I
                        slashed upward. The boar’s severed right tusk fell at my feet, while the disoriented animal
                        charged into the
                        sea. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I shouted, “Wave!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Immediately, a wave surged up from nowhere and engulfed the boar, wrapping
                        around it like a
                        blanket. The beast squealed once in terror. Then it was gone, swallowed by the sea. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/20-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned back to Ares. “Are you going to fight me now?” I asked. “Or are you
                        going to hide
                        behind another pet pig?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares’s face was purple with rage. “Watch it, kid. I could turn you into—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A cockroach,” I said. “Or a tapeworm. Yeah, I’m sure. That’d save you from
                        getting your godly
                        hide whipped, wouldn’t it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Flames danced along the top of his glasses. “Oh, man, you are really asking to
                        be smashed into
                        a grease spot.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“If I lose, turn me into anything you want. Take the bolt. If I win, the helm
                        and the bolt are
                        mine and <em class="calibre5">you </em>have to go away.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares sneered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He swung the baseball bat off his shoulder. “How would you like to get smashed:
                        classic or
                        modern?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I showed him my sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s cool, dead boy,” he said. “Classic it is.” The baseball bat changed
                        into a huge,
                        two-handed sword. The hilt was a large silver skull with a ruby in its mouth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy,” Annabeth said. “Don’t do this. He’s a god.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s a coward,” I told her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She swallowed. “Wear this, at least. For luck.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She took off her necklace, with her five years’ worth of camp beads and the
                        ring from her
                        father, and tied it around my neck. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Reconciliation,” she said. “Athena and Poseidon together.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My face felt a little warm, but I managed a smile. “Thanks.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And take this,” Grover said. He handed me a flattened tin can that he’d
                        probably been saving
                        in his pocket for a thousand miles. “The satyrs stand behind you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Grover…I don’t know what to say.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He patted me on the shoulder. I stuffed the tin can in my back pocket. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You all done saying good-bye?” Ares came toward me, his black leather duster
                        trailing behind
                        him, his sword glinting like fire in the sunrise. “I’ve been fighting for eternity, kid. My
                        strength is
                        unlimited and I cannot die. What have you got?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A smaller ego, I thought, but I said nothing. I kept my feet in the surf,
                        backing into the
                        water up to my ankles. I thought back to what Annabeth had said at the Denver diner, so long
                        ago: <em class="calibre5">Ares has strength. That’s all he has. Even strength has to bow to
                            wisdom sometimes</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He cleaved downward at my head, but I wasn’t there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My body thought for me. The water seemed to push me into the air and I
                        catapulted over him,
                        slashing as I came down. But Ares was just as quick. He twisted, and the strike that should’ve
                        caught him
                        directly in the spine was deflected off the end of his sword hilt. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He grinned. “Not bad, not bad.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He slashed again and I was forced to jump onto dry land. I tried to sidestep,
                        to get back to
                        the water, but Ares seemed to know what I wanted. He outmaneuvered me, pressing so hard I had to
                        put all my
                        concentration on not getting sliced into pieces. I kept backing away from the surf. I couldn’t
                        find any openings
                        to attack. His sword had a reach several feet longer than Anaklusmos. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Get in close</em>, Luke had told me once, back in our
                        sword class. <em class="calibre5">When you’ve got the shorter blade, get in close. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stepped inside with a thrust, but Ares was waiting for that. He knocked my
                        blade out of my
                        hands and kicked me in the chest. I went airborne—twenty, maybe thirty feet. I would’ve broken
                        my back if I
                        hadn’t crashed into the soft sand of a dune. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Annabeth yelled. “Cops!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was seeing double. My chest felt like it had just been hit with a battering
                        ram, but I
                        managed to get to my feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t look away from Ares for fear he’d slice me in half, but out of the
                        corner of my eye
                        I saw red lights flashing on the shoreline boulevard. Car doors were slamming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“There, officer!” somebody yelled. “See?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A gruff cop voice: “Looks like that kid on TV…what the heck…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That guy’s armed,” another cop said. “Call for backup.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I rolled to one side as Ares’s blade slashed the sand. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I ran for my sword, scooped it up, and launched a swipe at Ares’s face, only to
                        find my blade
                        deflected again. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares seemed to know exactly what I was going to do the moment before I did it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stepped back toward the surf, forcing him to follow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Admit it, kid,” Ares said. “You got no hope. I’m just toying with you.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My senses were working overtime. I now understood what Annabeth had said about
                        ADHD keeping you
                        alive in battle. I was wide awake, noticing every little detail. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I could see where Ares was tensing. I could tell which way he would strike. At
                        the same time, I
                        was aware of Annabeth and Grover, thirty feet to my left. I saw a second cop car pulling up,
                        siren wailing.
                        Spectators, people who had been wandering the streets because of the earthquake, were starting
                        to gather. Among
                        the crowd, I thought I saw a few who were walking with the strange, trotting gait of disguised
                        satyrs. There
                        were shimmering forms of spirits, too, as if the dead had risen from Hades to watch the battle.
                        I heard the flap
                        of leathery wings circling somewhere above. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">More sirens. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stepped farther into the water, but Ares was fast. The tip of his blade
                        ripped my sleeve and
                        grazed my forearm. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A police voice on a megaphone said, “Drop the guns! Set them on the ground.
                        Now!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Guns? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at Ares’s weapon, and it seemed to be flickering; sometimes it looked
                        like a shotgun,
                        sometimes a two-handed sword. I didn’t know what the humans were seeing in my hands, but I was
                        pretty sure it
                        wouldn’t make them like me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares turned to glare at our spectators, which gave me a moment to breathe.
                        There were five
                        police cars now, and a line of officers crouching behind them, pistols trained on us. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This is a private matter!” Ares bellowed. “Be gone!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He swept his hand, and a wall of red flame rolled across the patrol cars. The
                        police barely had
                        time to dive for cover before their vehicles exploded. The crowd behind them scattered,
                        screaming. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares roared with laughter. “Now, little hero. Let’s add you to the barbecue.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He slashed. I deflected his blade. I got close enough to strike, tried to fake
                        him out with a
                        feint, but my blow was knocked aside. The waves were hitting me in the back now. Ares was up to
                        his thighs,
                        wading in after me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I felt the rhythm of the sea, the waves growing larger as the tide rolled in,
                        and suddenly I
                        had an idea. <em class="calibre5">Little waves</em>, I thought. And the water behind me seemed
                        to recede. I was
                        holding back the tide by force of will, but tension was building, like carbonation behind a
                        cork. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares came forward, grinning confidently. I lowered my blade, as if I were too
                        exhausted to go
                        on. <em class="calibre5">Wait for it</em>, I told the sea. The pressure now was almost lifting
                        me off my feet.
                        Ares raised his sword. I released the tide and jumped, rocketing straight over Ares on a wave.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A six-foot wall of water smashed him full in the face, leaving him cursing and
                        sputtering with
                        a mouth full of seaweed. I landed behind him with a splash and feinted toward his head, as I’d
                        done before. He
                        turned in time to raise his sword, but this time he was disoriented, he didn’t anticipate the
                        trick. I changed
                        direction, lunged to the side, and stabbed Riptide straight down into the water, sending the
                        point through the
                        god’s heel. </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The roar that followed made Hades’s earthquake look like a minor event. The
                        very sea was
                        blasted back from Ares, leaving a wet circle of sand fifty feet wide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ichor, the golden blood of the gods, flowed from a gash in the war god’s boot.
                        The expression
                        on his face was beyond hatred. It was pain, shock, complete disbelief that he’d been wounded.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He limped toward me, muttering ancient Greek curses. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Something stopped him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was as if a cloud covered the sun, but worse. Light faded. Sound and color
                        drained away. A
                        cold, heavy presence passed over the beach, slowing time, dropping the temperature to freezing,
                        and making me
                        feel like life was hopeless, fighting was useless. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The darkness lifted. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares looked stunned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Police cars were burning behind us. The crowd of spectators had fled. Annabeth
                        and Grover stood
                        on the beach, in shock, watching the water flood back around Ares’s feet, his glowing golden
                        ichor dissipating
                        in the tide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Ares lowered his sword. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You have made an enemy, godling,” he told me. “You have sealed your fate.
                        Every time you raise
                        your blade in battle, every time you hope for success, you will feel my curse. Beware, Perseus
                        Jackson. Beware.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His body began to glow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy!” Annabeth shouted. “Don’t watch!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned away as the god Ares revealed his true immortal form. I somehow knew
                        that if I looked,
                        I would disintegrate into ashes. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">The light died. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked back. Ares was gone. The tide rolled out to reveal Hades’s bronze helm
                        of darkness. I
                        picked it up and walked toward my friends. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But before I got there, I heard the flapping of leathery wings. Three
                        evil-looking grandmothers
                        with lace hats and fiery whips drifted down from the sky and landed in front of me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The middle Fury, the one who had been Mrs. Dodds, stepped forward. Her fangs
                        were bared, but
                        for once she didn’t look threatening. She looked more disappointed, as if she’d been planning to
                        have me for
                        supper, but had decided I might give her indigestion. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We saw the whole thing,” she hissed. “So…it truly was not you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tossed her the helmet, which she caught in surprise. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Return that to Lord Hades,” I said. “Tell him the truth. Tell him to call off
                        the war.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She hesitated, then ran a forked tongue over her green, leathery lips. “Live
                        well, Percy
                        Jackson. Become a true hero. Because if you do not, if you ever come into my clutches again…”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She cackled, savoring the idea. Then she and her sisters rose on their bats’
                        wings, fluttered
                        into the smoke-filled sky, and disappeared. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I joined Grover and Annabeth, who were staring at me in amazement. “Percy…”
                        Grover said. “That
                        was so incredibly…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Terrifying,” said Annabeth. “Cool!” Grover corrected. I didn’t feel terrified.
                        I certainly
                        didn’t feel cool. I was tired and sore and completely drained of energy. “Did you guys feel
                        that…whatever it
                        was?” I asked. They both nodded uneasily. “Must’ve been the Furies overhead,” Grover said. But I
                        wasn’t so sure.
                        Something had stopped Ares from killing me, and whatever could do that was a lot stronger than
                        the Furies. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at Annabeth, and an understanding passed between us. I knew now what
                        was in that pit,
                        what had spoken from the entrance of Tartarus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I reclaimed my backpack from Grover and looked inside. The master bolt was
                        still there. Such a
                        small thing to almost cause World War III. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We have to get back to New York,” I said. “By tonight.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s impossible,” Annabeth said, “unless we—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Fly,” I agreed. She stared at me. “Fly, like, in an airplane, which you were
                        warned never to
                        do lest Zeus strike you out of the sky, <em class="calibre5">and </em>carrying a weapon that has
                        more
                        destructive power than a nuclear bomb?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah,” I said. “Pretty much exactly like that. Come on.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">I</span>t’s funny how humans can wrap their mind around
                        things and fit
                        them into their version of reality. Chiron had told me that long ago. As usual, I didn’t
                        appreciate his wisdom
                        until much later. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">According to the L.A. news, the explosion at the Santa Monica beach had been
                        caused when a
                        crazy kidnapper fired a shotgun at a police car. He accidentally hit a gas main that had
                        ruptured during the
                        earthquake. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">This crazy kidnapper (a.k.a. Ares) was the same man who had abducted me and two
                        other
                        adolescents in New York and brought us across country on a ten-day odyssey of terror. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Poor little Percy Jackson wasn’t an international criminal after all. He’d
                        caused a commotion
                        on that Greyhound bus in New Jersey trying to get away from his captor (and afterward, witnesses
                        would even
                        swear they had seen the leather-clad man on the bus—“Why didn’t I remember him before?”). The
                        crazy man had
                        caused the explosion in the St. Louis Arch. After all, no kid could’ve done that. A concerned
                        waitress in Denver
                        had seen the man threatening his abductees outside her diner, gotten a friend to take a photo,
                        and notified the
                        police. Finally, brave Percy Jackson (I was beginning to like this kid) had stolen a gun from
                        his captor in Los
                        Angeles and battled him shotgun-to-rifle on the beach. Police had arrived just in time. But in
                        the spectacular
                        explosion, five police cars had been destroyed and the captor had fled. No fatalities had
                        occurred. Percy
                        Jackson and his two friends were safely in police custody. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The reporters fed us this whole story. We just nodded and acted tearful and
                        exhausted (which
                        wasn’t hard), and played victimized kids for the cameras. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“All I want,” I said, choking back my tears, “is to see my loving stepfather
                        again. Every time
                        I saw him on TV, calling me a delinquent punk, I knew…somehow…we would be okay. And I know he’ll
                        want to reward
                        each and every person in this beautiful city of Los Angeles with a free major appliance from his
                        store. Here’s
                        the phone number.” The police and reporters were so moved that they passed around the hat and
                        raised money for
                        three tickets on the next plane to New York. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I knew there was no choice but to fly. I hoped Zeus would cut me some slack,
                        considering the
                        circumstances. But it was still hard to force myself on board the flight. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Takeoff was a nightmare. Every spot of turbulence was scarier than a Greek
                        monster. I didn’t
                        unclench my hands from the armrests until we touched down safely at La Guardia. The local press
                        was waiting for
                        us outside security, but we managed to evade them thanks to Annabeth, who lured them away in her
                        invisible
                        Yankees cap, shouting, “They’re over by the frozen yogurt! Come on!,” then rejoined us at
                        baggage claim. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We split up at the taxi stand. I told Annabeth and Grover to get back to
                        Half-Blood Hill and
                        let Chiron know what had happened. They protested, and it was hard to let them go after all we’d
                        been through,
                        but I knew I had to do this last part of the quest by myself. If things went wrong, if the gods
                        didn’t believe
                        me…I wanted Annabeth and Grover to survive to tell Chiron the truth. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I hopped in a taxi and headed into Manhattan. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">Thirty minutes later, I walked into the lobby of the Empire State Building.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I must have looked like a homeless kid, with my tattered clothes and my
                        scraped-up face. I
                        hadn’t slept in at least twenty-four hours. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I went up to the guard at the front desk and said, “Six hundredth floor.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was reading a huge book with a picture of a wizard on the front. I wasn’t
                        much into fantasy,
                        but the book must’ve been good, because the guard took a while to look up. “No such floor,
                        kiddo.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I need an audience with Zeus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gave me a vacant smile. “Sorry?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You heard me.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to decide this guy was just a regular mortal, and I’d better run
                        for it before he
                        called the straitjacket patrol, when he said, “No appointment, no audience, kiddo. Lord Zeus
                        doesn’t see anyone
                        unannounced.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, I think he’ll make an exception.” I slipped off my backpack and unzipped
                        the top. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The guard looked inside at the metal cylinder, not getting what it was for a
                        few seconds. Then
                        his face went pale. “That isn’t…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yes, it is,” I promised. “You want me take it out and—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No! No!” He scrambled out of his seat, fumbled around his desk for a key card,
                        then handed it
                        to me. “Insert this in the security slot. Make sure nobody else is in the elevator with you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I did as he told me. As soon as the elevator doors closed, I slipped the key
                        into the slot. The
                        card disappeared and a new button appeared on the console, a red one that said 600. I pressed it
                        and waited, and
                        waited. Muzak played. “Raindrops keep falling on my head.…” Finally, <em
                            class="calibre5">ding</em>. The doors
                        slid open. I stepped out and almost had a heart attack. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was standing on a narrow stone walkway in the middle of the air. Below me was
                        Manhattan, from
                        the height of an airplane. In front of me, white marble steps wound up the spine of a cloud,
                        into the sky. My
                        eyes followed the stairway to its end, where my brain just could not accept what I saw. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Look again, my brain said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We’re looking, my eyes insisted. It’s really there. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">From the top of the clouds rose the decapitated peak of a mountain, its summit
                        covered with
                        snow. Clinging to the mountainside were dozens of multileveled palaces—a city of mansions—all
                        with
                        white-columned porticos, gilded terraces, and bronze braziers glowing with a thousand fires.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Roads wound crazily up to the peak, where the largest palace gleamed against
                        the snow.
                        Precariously perched gardens bloomed with olive trees and rosebushes. I could make out an
                        open-air market filled
                        with colorful tents, a stone amphitheater built on one side of the mountain, a hippodrome and a
                        coliseum on the
                        other. It was an Ancient Greek city, except it wasn’t in ruins. It was new, and clean, and
                        colorful, the way
                        Athens must’ve looked twenty-five hundred years ago. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">This place can’t be here, I told myself. The tip of a mountain hanging over New
                        York City like
                        a billion-ton asteroid? How could something like that be anchored above the Empire State
                        Building, in plain
                        sight of millions of people, and not get noticed? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But here it was. And here I was. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/21-2.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">My trip through Olympus was a daze. I passed some giggling wood nymphs who
                        threw olives at me
                        from their garden. Hawkers in the market offered to sell me ambrosia-on-a-stick, and a new
                        shield, and a genuine
                        glitter-weave replica of the Golden Fleece, as seen on Hephaestus-TV. The nine muses were tuning
                        their
                        instruments for a concert in the park while a small crowd gathered—satyrs and naiads and a bunch
                        of good-looking
                        teenagers who might’ve been minor gods and goddesses. Nobody seemed worried about an impending
                        civil war. In
                        fact, everybody seemed in a festive mood. Several of them turned to watch me pass, and whispered
                        to themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I climbed the main road, toward the big palace at the peak. It was a reverse
                        copy of the palace
                        in the Underworld. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There, everything had been black and bronze. Here, everything glittered white
                        and silver. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I realized Hades must’ve built his palace to resemble this one. He wasn’t
                        welcomed in Olympus
                        except on the winter solstice, so he’d built his own Olympus underground. Despite my bad
                        experience with him, I
                        felt a little sorry for the guy. To be banished from this place seemed really unfair. It would
                        make anybody
                        bitter. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Steps led up to a central courtyard. Past that, the throne room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Room </em>really isn’t the right word. The place made
                        Grand Central
                        Station look like a broom closet. Massive columns rose to a domed ceiling, which was gilded with
                        moving
                        constellations. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Twelve thrones, built for beings the size of Hades, were arranged in an
                        inverted U, just like
                        the cabins at Camp Half-Blood. An enormous fire crackled in the central hearth pit. The thrones
                        were empty
                        except for two at the end: the head throne on the right, and the one to its immediate left. I
                        didn’t have to be
                        told who the two gods were that were sitting there, waiting for me to approach. I came toward
                        them, my legs
                        trembling. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The gods were in giant human form, as Hades had been, but I could barely look
                        at them without
                        feeling a tingle, as if my body were starting to burn. Zeus, the Lord of the Gods, wore a dark
                        blue pinstriped
                        suit. He sat on a simple throne of solid platinum. He had a well-trimmed beard, marbled gray and
                        black like a
                        storm cloud. His face was proud and handsome and grim, his eyes rainy gray. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As I got nearer to him, the air crackled and smelled of ozone. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The god sitting next to him was his brother, without a doubt, but he was
                        dressed very
                        differently. He reminded me of a beachcomber from Key West. He wore leather sandals, khaki
                        Bermuda shorts, and a
                        Tommy Bahama shirt with coconuts and parrots all over it. His skin was deeply tanned, his hands
                        scarred like an
                        old-time fisherman’s. His hair was black, like mine. His face had that same brooding look that
                        had always gotten
                        me branded a rebel. But his eyes, sea-green like mine, were surrounded by sun-crinkles that told
                        me he smiled a
                        lot, too. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His throne was a deep-sea fisherman’s chair. It was the simple swiveling kind,
                        with a black
                        leather seat and a built-in holster for a fishing pole. Instead of a pole, the holster held a
                        bronze trident,
                        flickering with green light around the tips. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The gods weren’t moving or speaking, but there was tension in the air, as if
                        they’d just
                        finished an argument. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I approached the fisherman’s throne and knelt at his feet. “Father.” I dared
                        not look up. My
                        heart was racing. I could feel the energy emanating from the two gods. If I said the wrong
                        thing, I had no doubt
                        they could blast me into dust. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">To my left, Zeus spoke. “Should you not address the master of this house first,
                        boy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I kept my head down, and waited. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Peace, brother,” Poseidon finally said. His voice stirred my oldest memories:
                        that warm glow I
                        remembered as a baby, the sensation of this god’s hand on my forehead. “The boy defers to his
                        father. This is
                        only right.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You still claim him then?” Zeus asked, menacingly. “You claim this child whom
                        you sired
                        against our sacred oath?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have admitted my wrongdoing,” Poseidon said. “Now I would hear him speak.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Wrongdoing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A lump welled up in my throat. Was that all I was? A wrongdoing? The result of
                        a god’s mistake?
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I have spared him once already,” Zeus grumbled. “Daring to fly through my
                        domain…pah! I should
                        have blasted him out of the sky for his impudence.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And risk destroying your own master bolt?” Poseidon asked calmly. “Let us hear
                        him out,
                        brother.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Zeus grumbled some more. “I shall listen,” he decided. “Then I shall make up my
                        mind whether or
                        not to cast this boy down from Olympus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Perseus,” Poseidon said. “Look at me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I did, and I wasn’t sure what I saw in his face. There was no clear sign of
                        love or approval.
                        Nothing to encourage me. It was like looking at the ocean: some days, you could tell what mood
                        it was in. Most
                        days, though, it was unreadable, mysterious. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got the feeling Poseidon really didn’t know what to think of me. He didn’t
                        know whether he
                        was happy to have me as a son or not. In a strange way, I was glad that Poseidon was so distant.
                        If he’d tried
                        to apologize, or told me he loved me, or even smiled, it would’ve felt fake. Like a human dad,
                        making some lame
                        excuse for not being around. I could live with that. After all, I wasn’t sure about him yet,
                        either. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Address Lord Zeus, boy,” Poseidon told me. “Tell him your story.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">So I told Zeus everything, just as it had happened. I took out the metal
                        cylinder, which began
                        sparking in the Sky God’s presence, and laid it at his feet. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a long silence, broken only by the crackle of the hearth fire. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Zeus opened his palm. The lightning bolt flew into it. As he closed his fist,
                        the metallic
                        points flared with electricity, until he was holding what looked more like the classic
                        thunderbolt, a
                        twenty-foot javelin of arcing, hissing energy that made the hairs on my scalp rise. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/21-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I sense the boy tells the truth,” Zeus muttered. “But that Ares would do such
                        a thing…it is
                        most unlike him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He is proud and impulsive,” Poseidon said. “It runs in the family.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Lord?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They both said, “Yes?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Ares didn’t act alone. Someone else—something else—came up with the idea.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I described my dreams, and the feeling I’d had on the beach, that momentary
                        breath of evil that
                        had seemed to stop the world, and made Ares back off from killing me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“In the dreams,” I said, “the voice told me to bring the bolt to the
                        Underworld. Ares hinted
                        that he’d been having dreams, too. I think he was being used, just as I was, to start a war.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You are accusing Hades, after all?” Zeus asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No,” I said. “I mean, Lord Zeus, I’ve been in the presence of Hades. This
                        feeling on the beach
                        was different. It was the same thing I felt when I got close to that pit. That was the entrance
                        to Tartarus,
                        wasn’t it? Something powerful and evil is stirring down there…something even older than the
                        gods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Poseidon and Zeus looked at each other. They had a quick, intense discussion in
                        Ancient Greek.
                        I only caught one word. <em class="calibre5">Father</em>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Poseidon made some kind of suggestion, but Zeus cut him off. Poseidon tried to
                        argue. Zeus held
                        up his hand angrily. “We will speak of this no more,” Zeus said. “I must go personally to purify
                        this
                        thunderbolt in the waters of Lemnos, to remove the human taint from its metal.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He rose and looked at me. His expression softened just a fraction of a degree.
                        “You have done
                        me a service, boy. Few heroes could have accomplished as much.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I had help, sir,” I said. “Grover Underwood and Annabeth Chase—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“To show you my thanks, I shall spare your life. I do not trust you, Perseus
                        Jackson. I do not
                        like what your arrival means for the future of Olympus. But for the sake of peace in the family,
                        I shall let you
                        live.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um…thank you, sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Do not presume to fly again. Do not let me find you here when I return.
                        Otherwise you shall
                        taste this bolt. And it shall be your last sensation.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder shook the palace. With a blinding flash of lightning, Zeus was gone.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was alone in the throne room with my father. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your uncle,” Poseidon sighed, “has always had a flair for dramatic exits. I
                        think he would’ve
                        done well as the god of theater.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">An uncomfortable silence. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sir,” I said, “what was in that pit?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Poseidon regarded me. “Have you not guessed?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Kronos,” I said. “The king of the Titans.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Even in the throne room of Olympus, far away from Tartarus, the name <em
                            class="calibre5">Kronos </em>darkened the room, made the hearth fire seem not quite so warm
                        on my back. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Poseidon gripped his trident. “In the First War, Percy, Zeus cut our father
                        Kronos into a
                        thousand pieces, just as Kronos had done to his own father, Ouranos. Zeus cast Kronos’s remains
                        into the darkest
                        pit of Tartarus. The Titan army was scattered, their mountain fortress on Etna destroyed, their
                        monstrous allies
                        driven to the farthest corners of the earth. And yet Titans cannot die, any more than we gods
                        can. Whatever is
                        left of Kronos is still alive in some hideous way, still conscious in his eternal pain, still
                        hungering for
                        power.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s healing,” I said. “He’s coming back.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Poseidon shook his head. “From time to time, over the eons, Kronos has stirred.
                        He enters men’s
                        nightmares and breathes evil thoughts. He wakens restless monsters from the depths. But to
                        suggest he could rise
                        from the pit is another thing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s what he intends, Father. That’s what he said.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Poseidon was silent for a long time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Lord Zeus has closed discussion on this matter. He will not allow talk of
                        Kronos. You have
                        completed your quest, child. That is all you need to do.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But—” I stopped myself. Arguing would do no good. It would very possibly anger
                        the only god
                        who I had on my side. “As…as you wish, Father.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A faint smile played on his lips. “Obedience does not come naturally to you,
                        does it?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“No…sir.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I must take some blame for that, I suppose. The sea does not like to be
                        restrained.” He rose
                        to his full height and took up his trident. Then he shimmered and became the size of a regular
                        man, standing
                        directly in front of me. “You must go, child. But first, know that your mother has returned.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at him, completely stunned. “My mother?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You will find her at home. Hades sent her when you recovered his helm. Even
                        the Lord of Death
                        pays his debts.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My heart was pounding. I couldn’t believe it. “Do you…would you…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to ask if Poseidon would come with me to see her, but then I realized
                        that was
                        ridiculous. I imagined loading the God of the Sea into a taxi and taking him to the Upper East
                        Side. If he’d
                        wanted to see my mom all these years, he would have. And there was Smelly Gabe to think about.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Poseidon’s eyes took on a little sadness. “When you return home, Percy, you
                        must make an
                        important choice. You will find a package waiting in your room.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“A package?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You will understand when you see it. No one can choose your path, Percy. You
                        must decide.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I nodded, though I didn’t know what he meant. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Your mother is a queen among women,” Poseidon said wistfully. “I had not met
                        such a mortal
                        woman in a thousand years. Still…I am sorry you were born, child. I have brought you a hero’s
                        fate, and a hero’s
                        fate is never happy. It is never anything but tragic.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried not to feel hurt. Here was my own dad, telling me he was sorry I’d been
                        born. “I don’t
                        mind, Father.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Not yet, perhaps,” he said. “Not yet. But it was an unforgivable mistake on my
                        part.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll leave you then.” I bowed awkwardly. “I—I won’t bother you again.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was five steps away when he called, “Perseus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I turned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There was a different light in his eyes, a fiery kind of pride. “You did well,
                        Perseus. Do not
                        misunderstand me. Whatever else you do, know that you are mine. You are a true son of the Sea
                        God.” </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">As I walked back through the city of the gods, conversations stopped. The muses
                        paused their
                        concert. People and satyrs and naiads all turned toward me, their faces filled with respect and
                        gratitude, and
                        as I passed, they knelt, as if I were some kind of hero. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13">Fifteen minutes later, still in a trance, I was back on the streets of
                        Manhattan. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I caught a taxi to my mom’s apartment, rang the doorbell, and there she was—my
                        beautiful
                        mother, smelling of peppermint and licorice, the weariness and worry evaporating from her face
                        as soon as she
                        saw me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy! Oh, thank goodness. Oh, my baby.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She crushed the air right out of me. We stood in the hallway as she cried and
                        ran her hands
                        through my hair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’ll admit it—my eyes were a little misty, too. I was shaking, I was so
                        relieved to see her.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She told me she’d just appeared at the apartment that morning, scaring Gabe
                        half out of his
                        wits. She didn’t remember anything since the Minotaur, and couldn’t believe it when Gabe told
                        her I was a wanted
                        criminal, traveling across the country, blowing up national monuments. She’d been going out of
                        her mind with
                        worry all day because she hadn’t heard the news. Gabe had forced her to go into work, saying she
                        had a month’s
                        salary to make up and she’d better get started. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I swallowed back my anger and told her my own story. I tried to make it sound
                        less scary than
                        it had been, but that wasn’t easy. I was just getting to the fight with Ares when Gabe’s voice
                        interrupted from
                        the living room. “Hey, Sally! That meat loaf done yet or what?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She closed her eyes. “He isn’t going to be happy to see you, Percy. The store
                        got half a
                        million phone calls today from Los Angeles…something about free appliances.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Oh, yeah. About that…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She managed a weak smile. “Just don’t make him angrier, all right? Come on.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">In the month I’d been gone, the apartment had turned into Gabeland. Garbage was
                        ankle deep on
                        the carpet. The sofa had been reupholstered in beer cans. Dirty socks and underwear hung off the
                        lampshades.
                    </p>

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe and three of his big goony friends were playing poker at the table. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">When Gabe saw me, his cigar dropped out of his mouth. His face got redder than
                        lava. “You got
                        nerve coming here, you little punk. I thought the police—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s not a fugitive after all,” my mom interjected. “Isn’t that wonderful,
                        Gabe?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe looked back and forth between us. He didn’t seem to think my homecoming
                        was so wonderful.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Bad enough I had to give back your life insurance money, Sally,” he growled.
                        “Get me the
                        phone. I’ll call the cops.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Gabe, no!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He raised his eyebrows. “Did you just say <em class="calibre5">‘no’ </em>? You
                        think I’m gonna
                        put up with this punk again? I can still press charges against him for ruining my Camaro.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“But—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He raised his hand, and my mother flinched. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For the first time, I realized something. Gabe had hit my mother. I didn’t know
                        when, or how
                        much. But I was sure he’d done it. Maybe it had been going on for years, when I wasn’t around.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A balloon of anger started expanding in my chest. I came toward Gabe,
                        instinctively taking my
                        pen out of my pocket. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He just laughed. “What, punk? You gonna write on me? You touch me, and you are
                        going to jail
                        forever, you understand?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, Gabe,” his friend Eddie interrupted. “He’s just a kid.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Gabe looked at him resentfully and mimicked in a falsetto voice: <em
                            class="calibre5">“Just a
                            kid.” </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His other friends laughed like idiots. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll be nice to you, punk.” Gabe showed me his tobacco-stained teeth. “I’ll
                        give you five
                        minutes to get your stuff and clear out. After that, I call the police.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Gabe!” my mother pleaded. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He ran away,” Gabe told her. “Let him stay gone.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was itching to uncap Riptide, but even if I did, the blade wouldn’t hurt
                        humans. And Gabe, by
                        the loosest definition, was human. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My mother took my arm. “Please, Percy. Come on. We’ll go to your room.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I let her pull me away, my hands still trembling with rage. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My room had been completely filled with Gabe’s junk. There were stacks of used
                        car batteries, a
                        rotting bouquet of sympathy flowers with a card from somebody who’d seen his Barbara Walters
                        interview. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Gabe is just upset, honey,” my mother told me. “I’ll talk to him later. I’m
                        sure it will work
                        out.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom, it’ll never work out. Not as long as Gabe’s here.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She wrung her hands nervously. “I can…I’ll take you to work with me for the
                        rest of the summer.
                        In the fall, maybe there’s another boarding school—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She lowered her eyes. “I’m trying, Percy. I just…I need some time.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A package appeared on my bed. At least, I could’ve sworn it hadn’t been there a
                        moment before.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was a battered cardboard box about the right size to fit a basketball. The
                        address on the
                        mailing slip was in my own handwriting: </p>

                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p class="calibre15"></p>

                    <p class="calibre14">Over the top in black marker, in a man’s clear, bold print, was the address of
                        our apartment,
                        and the words: <small class="calibre4">RETURN TO SENDER</small>. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Suddenly I understood what Poseidon had told me on Olympus. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A package. A decision. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Whatever else you do, know that you are mine. You are a
                            true son of the Sea
                            God. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at my mother. “Mom, do you want Gabe gone?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, it isn’t that simple. I—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Mom, just tell me. That jerk has been hitting you. Do you want him gone or
                        not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She hesitated, then nodded almost imperceptibly. “Yes, Percy. I do. And I’m
                        trying to get up my
                        courage to tell him. But you can’t do this for me. You can’t solve my problems.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I looked at the box. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I <em class="calibre5">could </em>solve her problem. I wanted to slice that
                        package open, plop
                        it on the poker table, and take out what was inside. I could start my very own statue garden,
                        right there in the
                        living room. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That’s what a Greek hero would do in the stories, I thought. That’s what Gabe
                        deserves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But a hero’s story always ended in tragedy. Poseidon had told me that. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I remembered the Underworld. I thought about Gabe’s spirit drifting forever in
                        the Fields of
                        Asphodel, or condemned to some hideous torture behind the barbed wire of the Fields of
                        Punishment—an eternal
                        poker game, sitting up to his waist in boiling oil listening to opera music. Did I have the
                        right to send
                        someone there? Even Gabe? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A month ago, I wouldn’t have hesitated. Now…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I can do it,” I told my mom. “One look inside this box, and he’ll never bother
                        you again.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She glanced at the package, and seemed to understand immediately. “No, Percy,”
                        she said,
                        stepping away. “You can’t.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Poseidon called you a queen,” I told her. “He said he hadn’t met a woman like
                        you in a
                        thousand years.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Her cheeks flushed. “Percy—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You deserve better than this, Mom. You should go to college, get your degree.
                        You can write
                        your novel, meet a nice guy maybe, live in a nice house. You don’t need to protect me anymore by
                        staying with
                        Gabe. Let me get rid of him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She wiped a tear off her cheek. “You sound so much like your father,” she said.
                        “He offered to
                        stop the tide for me once. He offered to build me a palace at the bottom of the sea. He thought
                        he could solve
                        all my problems with a wave of his hand.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s wrong with that?” </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/21-7.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Her multicolored eyes seemed to search inside me. “I think you know, Percy. I
                        think you’re
                        enough like me to understand. If my life is going to mean anything, I have to live it myself. I
                        can’t let a god
                        take care of me…or my son. I have to…find the courage on my own. Your quest has reminded me of
                        that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We listened to the sound of poker chips and swearing, ESPN from the living room
                        television.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll leave the box,” I said. “If he threatens you…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked pale, but she nodded. “Where will you go, Percy?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Half-Blood Hill.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“For the summer…or forever?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I guess that depends.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We locked eyes, and I sensed that we had an agreement. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We would see how things stood at the end of the summer. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She kissed my forehead. “You’ll be a hero, Percy. You’ll be the greatest of
                        all.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I took one last look around my bedroom. I had a feeling I’d never see it again.
                        Then I walked
                        with my mother to the front door. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Leaving so soon, punk?” Gabe called after me. “Good riddance.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I had one last twinge of doubt. How could I turn down the perfect chance to
                        take revenge on
                        him? I was leaving here without saving my mother. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, Sally,” he yelled. “What about that meat loaf, huh?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A steely look of anger flared in my mother’s eyes, and I thought, just maybe, I
                        was leaving her
                        in good hands after all. Her own. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The meat loaf is coming right up, dear,” she told Gabe. “Meat loaf surprise.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She looked at me, and winked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The last thing I saw as the door swung closed was my mother staring at Gabe, as
                        if she were
                        contemplating how he would look as a garden statue. </p>

                    <p class="calibre13"><span class="bigcap">W</span>e were the first heroes to return alive to
                        Half-Blood Hill since
                        Luke, so of course everybody treated us as if we’d won some reality-TV contest. According to
                        camp tradition, we
                        wore laurel wreaths to a big feast prepared in our honor, then led a procession down to the
                        bonfire, where we
                        got to burn the burial shrouds our cabins had made for us in our absence. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth’s shroud was so beautiful—gray silk with embroidered owls—I told her
                        it seemed a shame
                        not to bury her in it. She punched me and told me to shut up. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">Being the son of Poseidon, I didn’t have any cabin mates, so the Ares cabin had
                        volunteered to
                        make my shroud. They’d taken an old bedsheet and painted smiley faces with X’ed-out eyes around
                        the border, and
                        the word <small class="calibre4">LOSER</small> painted really big in the middle. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was fun to burn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As Apollo’s cabin led the sing-along and passed out s’mores, I was surrounded
                        by my old Hermes
                        cabinmates, Annabeth’s friends from Athena, and Grover’s satyr buddies, who were admiring the
                        brand-new
                        searcher’s license he’d received from the Council of Cloven Elders. The council had called
                        Grover’s performance
                        on the quest “Brave to the point of indigestion. Horns-and-whiskers above anything we have seen
                        in the past.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The only ones not in a party mood were Clarisse and her cabinmates, whose
                        poisonous looks told
                        me they’d never forgive me for disgracing their dad. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">That was okay with me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Even Dionysus’s welcome-home speech wasn’t enough to dampen my spirits. “Yes,
                        yes, so the
                        little brat didn’t get himself killed and now he’ll have an even bigger head. Well, huzzah for
                        that. In other
                        announcements, there will be <em class="calibre5">no </em>canoe races this Saturday.…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I moved back into cabin three, but it didn’t feel so lonely anymore. I had my
                        friends to train
                        with during the day. At night, I lay awake and listened to the sea, knowing my father was out
                        there. Maybe he
                        wasn’t quite sure about me yet, maybe he hadn’t even wanted me born, but he was watching. And so
                        far, he was
                        proud of what I’d done. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As for my mother, she had a chance at a new life. Her letter arrived a week
                        after I got back to
                        camp. She told me Gabe had left mysteriously—disappeared off the face of the planet, in fact.
                        She’d reported him
                        missing to the police, but she had a funny feeling they would never find him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">On a completely unrelated subject, she’d sold her first life-size concrete
                        sculpture, entitled
                        <em class="calibre5">The Poker Player</em>, to a collector, through an art gallery in Soho.
                        She’d gotten so much
                        money for it, she’d put a deposit down on a new apartment and made a payment on her first
                        semester’s tuition at
                        NYU. The Soho gallery was clamoring for more of her work, which they called “a huge step forward
                        in super-ugly
                        neorealism.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">But don’t worry, </em>my mom wrote. <em
                            class="calibre5">I’m done with
                            sculpture. I’ve disposed of that box of tools you left me. It’s time for me to turn to

                    <p class="calibre14">At the bottom, she wrote a P.S.: <em class="calibre5">Percy, I’ve found a good
                            private school
                            here in the city. I’ve put a deposit down to hold you a spot, in case you want to enroll for
                            seventh grade.

                            understand.</em> </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I folded the note carefully and set it on my bedside table. Every night before
                        I went to sleep,
                        I read it again, and I tried to decide how to answer her. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">On the Fourth of July, the whole camp gathered at the beach for a fireworks
                        display by cabin
                        nine. Being Hephaestus’s kids, they weren’t going to settle for a few lame red-white-and-blue
                        explosions. They’d
                        anchored a barge offshore and loaded it with rockets the size of Patriot missiles. According to
                        Annabeth, who’d
                        seen the show before, the blasts would be sequenced so tightly they’d look like frames of
                        animation across the
                        sky. The finale was supposed to be a couple of hundred-foot-tall Spartan warriors who would
                        crackle to life
                        above the ocean, fight a battle, then explode into a million colors. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">As Annabeth and I were spreading a picnic blanket, Grover showed up to tell us
                        good-bye. He was
                        dressed in his usual jeans and T-shirt and sneakers, but in the last few weeks he’d started to
                        look older,
                        almost high-school age. His goatee had gotten thicker. He’d put on weight. His horns had grown
                        at least an inch,
                        so he now had to wear his rasta cap all the time to pass as human. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m off,” he said. “I just came to say…well, you know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I tried to feel happy for him. After all, it wasn’t every day a satyr got
                        permission to go look
                        for the great god Pan. But it was hard saying good-bye. I’d only known Grover a year, yet he was
                        my oldest
                        friend. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth gave him a hug. She told him to keep his fake feet on. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I asked him where he was going to search first. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Kind of a secret,” he said, looking embarrassed. “I wish you could come with
                        me, guys, but
                        humans and Pan…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We understand,” Annabeth said. “You got enough tin cans for the trip?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And you remembered your reed pipes?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Jeez, Annabeth,” he grumbled. “You’re like an old mama goat.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But he didn’t really sound annoyed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gripped his walking stick and slung a backpack over his shoulder. He looked
                        like any
                        hitchhiker you might see on an American highway—nothing like the little runty boy I used to
                        defend from bullies
                        at Yancy Academy. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Well,” he said, “wish me luck.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gave Annabeth another hug. He clapped me on the shoulder, then headed back
                        through the
                        dunes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Fireworks exploded to life overhead: Hercules killing the Nemean lion, Artemis
                        chasing the
                        boar, George Washington (who, by the way, was a son of Athena) crossing the Delaware. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Hey, Grover,” I called. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He turned at the edge of the woods. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Wherever you’re going—I hope they make good enchiladas.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Grover grinned, and then he was gone, the trees closing around him. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We’ll see him again,” Annabeth said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">I tried to believe it. The fact that no searcher had ever come back in two
                        thousand years…well,
                        I decided not to think about that. Grover would be the first. He had to be. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">July passed. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I spent my days devising new strategies for capture-the-flag and making
                        alliances with the
                        other cabins to keep the banner out of Ares’s hands. I got to the top of the climbing wall for
                        the first time
                        without getting scorched by lava. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">From time to time, I’d walk past the Big House, glance up at the attic windows,
                        and think about
                        the Oracle. I tried to convince myself that its prophecy had come to completion. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">You shall go west, and face the god who has turned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Been there, done that—even though the traitor god had turned out to be Ares
                        rather than Hades.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">You shall find what was stolen, and see it safely returned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Check. One master bolt delivered. One helm of darkness back on Hades’s oily
                        head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">You shall be betrayed by one who calls you a friend. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">This line still bothered me. Ares had pretended to be my friend, then betrayed
                        me. That must be
                        what the Oracle meant.…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">And you shall fail to save what matters most, in the end. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I <em class="calibre5">had </em>failed to save my mom, but only because I’d let
                        her save
                        herself, and I knew that was the right thing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15">So why was I still uneasy? </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">The last night of the summer session came all too quickly. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The campers had one last meal together. We burned part of our dinner for the
                        gods. At the
                        bonfire, the senior counselors awarded the end-of-summer beads. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got my own leather necklace, and when I saw the bead for my first summer, I
                        was glad the
                        firelight covered my blushing. The design was pitch black, with a sea-green trident shimmering
                        in the center.
                    </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“The choice was unanimous,” Luke announced. “This bead commemorates the first
                        Son of the Sea
                        God at this camp, and the quest he undertook into the darkest part of the Underworld to stop a
                        war!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The entire camp got to their feet and cheered. Even Ares’s cabin felt obliged
                        to stand.
                        Athena’s cabin steered Annabeth to the front so she could share in the applause. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I’m not sure I’d ever felt as happy or sad as I did at that moment. I’d finally
                        found a family,
                        people who cared about me and thought I’d done something right. And in the morning, most of them
                        would be
                        leaving for the year. </p>

                        staring one in the
                        face. Summer was over, and I still hadn’t answered my mother, or the camp, about whether I’d be
                        staying. Now I
                        had only a few hours to decide. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The decision should have been easy. I mean, nine months of hero training or
                        nine months of
                        sitting in a classroom—duh. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">But there was my mom to consider. For the first time, I had the chance to live
                        with her for a
                        whole year, without Gabe. I had a chance to be at home and knock around the city in my free
                        time. I remembered
                        what Annabeth had said so long ago on our quest: <em class="calibre5">The real world is where
                            the monsters are.
                            That’s where you learn whether you’re any good or not. </em></p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about the fate of Thalia, daughter of Zeus. I wondered how many
                        monsters would attack
                        me if I left Half-Blood Hill. If I stayed in one place for a whole school year, without Chiron
                        or my friends
                        around to help me, would my mother and I even survive until the next summer? That was assuming
                        the spelling
                        tests and five-paragraph essays didn’t kill me. I decided I’d go down to the arena and do some
                        sword practice.
                        Maybe that would clear my head. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The campgrounds were mostly deserted, shimmering in the August heat. All the
                        campers were in
                        their cabins packing up, or running around with brooms and mops, getting ready for final
                        inspection. Argus was
                        helping some of the Aphrodite kids haul their Gucci suitcases and makeup kits over the hill,
                        where the camp’s
                        shuttle bus would be waiting to take them to the airport. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Don’t think about leaving yet, I told myself. Just train. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I got to the sword-fighters arena and found that Luke had had the same idea.
                        His gym bag was
                        plopped at the edge of the stage. He was working solo, whaling on battle dummies with a sword
                        I’d never seen
                        before. It must’ve been a regular steel blade, because he was slashing the dummies’ heads right
                        off, stabbing
                        through their straw-stuffed guts. His orange counselor’s shirt was dripping with sweat. His
                        expression was so
                        intense, his life might’ve really been in danger. I watched, fascinated, as he disemboweled the
                        whole row of
                        dummies, hacking off limbs and basically reducing them to a pile of straw and armor. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">They were only dummies, but I still couldn’t help being awed by Luke’s skill.
                        The guy was an
                        incredible fighter. It made me wonder, again, how he possibly could’ve failed at his quest. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/22-3.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">Finally, he saw me, and stopped mid-swing. “Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Um, sorry,” I said, embarrassed. “I just—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“It’s okay,” he said, lowering his sword. “Just doing some last-minute
                        practice.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Those dummies won’t be bothering anybody anymore.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke shrugged. “We build new ones every summer.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Now that his sword wasn’t swirling around, I could see something odd about it.
                        The blade was
                        two different types of metal—one edge bronze, the other steel. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke noticed me looking at it. “Oh, this? New toy. This is Backbiter.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Backbiter?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke turned the blade in the light so it glinted wickedly. “One side is
                        celestial bronze. The
                        other is tempered steel. Works on mortals and immortals both.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I thought about what Chiron had told me when I started my quest—that a hero
                        should never harm
                        mortals unless absolutely necessary. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I didn’t know they could make weapons like that.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">They </em>probably can’t,” Luke agreed. “It’s one of a
                        kind.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He gave me a tiny smile, then slid the sword into its scabbard. “Listen, I was
                        going to come
                        looking for you. What do you say we go down to the woods one last time, look for something to
                        fight?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I don’t know why I hesitated. I should’ve felt relieved that Luke was being so
                        friendly. Ever
                        since I’d gotten back from the quest, he’d been acting a little distant. I was afraid he might
                        resent me for all
                        the attention I’d gotten. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You think it’s a good idea?” I asked. “I mean—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Aw, come on.” He rummaged in his gym bag and pulled out a six-pack of Cokes.
                        “Drinks are on
                        me.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at the Cokes, wondering where the heck he’d gotten them. There were no
                        regular mortal
                        sodas at the camp store. No way to smuggle them in unless you talked to a satyr, maybe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Of course, the magic dinner goblets would fill with anything you want, but it
                        just didn’t taste
                        the same as a real Coke, straight out of the can. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Sugar and caffeine. My willpower crumbled. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sure,” I decided. “Why not?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We walked down to the woods and kicked around for some kind of monster to
                        fight, but it was too
                        hot. All the monsters with any sense must’ve been taking siestas in their nice cool caves. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">We found a shady spot by the creek where I’d broken Clarisse’s spear during my
                        first capture
                        the flag game. We sat on a big rock, drank our Cokes, and watched the sunlight in the woods.
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">After a while Luke said, “You miss being on a quest?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“With monsters attacking me every three feet? Are you kidding?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke raised an eyebrow. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah, I miss it,” I admitted. “You?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">A shadow passed over his face. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was used to hearing from the girls how good-looking Luke was, but at the
                        moment, he looked
                        weary, and angry, and not at all handsome. His blond hair was gray in the sunlight. The scar on
                        his face looked
                        deeper than usual. I could imagine him as an old man. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ve lived at Half-Blood Hill year-round since I was fourteen,” he told me.
                        “Ever since
                        Thalia…well, you know. I trained, and trained, and trained. I never got to be a normal teenager,
                        out there in
                        the real world. Then they threw me one quest, and when I came back, it was like, ‘Okay, ride’s
                        over. Have a nice
                        life.’” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He crumpled his Coke can and threw into the creek, which really shocked me. One
                        of the first
                        things you learn at Camp Half-Blood is: Don’t litter. You’ll hear from the nymphs and the
                        naiads. They’ll get
                        even. You’ll crawl into bed one night and find your sheets filled with centipedes and mud. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The heck with laurel wreaths,” Luke said. “I’m not going to end up like those
                        dusty trophies
                        in the Big House attic.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You make it sound like you’re leaving.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke gave me a twisted smile. “Oh, I’m leaving, all right, Percy. I brought you
                        down here to
                        say good-bye.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He snapped his fingers. A small fire burned a hole in the ground at my feet.
                        Out crawled
                        something glistening black, about the size of my hand. A scorpion. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/22-4.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">I started to go for my pen. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I wouldn’t,” Luke cautioned. “Pit scorpions can jump up to fifteen feet. Its
                        stinger can
                        pierce right through your clothes. You’ll be dead in sixty seconds.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Luke, what—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then it hit me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">You will be betrayed by one who calls you a friend. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He stood calmly and brushed off his jeans. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The scorpion paid him no attention. It kept its beady black eyes on me,
                        clamping its pincers as
                        it crawled onto my shoe. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I saw a lot out there in the world, Percy,” Luke said. “Didn’t you feel it—the
                        darkness
                        gathering, the monsters growing stronger? Didn’t you realize how useless it all is? All the
                        heroics—being pawns
                        of the gods. They should’ve been overthrown thousands of years ago, but they’ve hung on, thanks
                        to us
                        half-bloods.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I couldn’t believe this was happening. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Luke…you’re talking about our parents,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He laughed. “That’s supposed to make me love them? Their precious ‘Western
                        civilization’ is a
                        disease, Percy. It’s killing the world. The only way to stop it is to burn it to the ground,
                        start over with
                        something more honest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re as crazy as Ares.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His eyes flared. “Ares is a fool. He never realized the true master he was
                        serving. If I had
                        time, Percy, I could explain. But I’m afraid you won’t live that long.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The scorpion crawled onto my pants leg. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">There had to be a way out of this. I needed time to think. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Kronos,” I said. “That’s who you serve.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The air got colder. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You should be careful with names,” Luke warned. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Kronos got you to steal the master bolt and the helm. He spoke to you in your
                        dreams.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke’s eye twitched. “He spoke to you, too, Percy. You should’ve listened.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“He’s brainwashing you, Luke.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re wrong. He showed me that my talents are being wasted. You know what my
                        quest was two
                        years ago, Percy? My father, Hermes, wanted me to steal a golden apple from the Garden of the
                        Hesperides and
                        return it to Olympus. After all the training I’d done, <em class="calibre5">that </em>was the
                        best he could
                        think up.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That’s not an easy quest,” I said. “Hercules did it.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Exactly,” Luke said. “Where’s the glory in repeating what others have done?
                        All the gods know
                        how to do is replay their past. My heart wasn’t in it. The dragon in the garden gave me this”—he
                        pointed angrily
                        at his scar—“and when I came back, all I got was pity. I wanted to pull Olympus down stone by
                        stone right then,
                        but I bided my time. I began to dream of Kronos. He convinced me to steal something worthwhile,
                        something no
                        hero had ever had the courage to take. When we went on that winter-solstice field trip, while
                        the other campers
                        were asleep, I snuck into the throne room and took Zeus’s master bolt right from his chair.
                        Hades’s helm of
                        darkness, too. You wouldn’t believe how easy it was. The Olympians are so arrogant; they never
                        dreamed someone
                        would dare steal from them. Their security is horrible. I was halfway across New Jersey before I
                        heard the
                        storms rumbling, and I knew they’d discovered my theft.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The scorpion was sitting on my knee now, staring at me with its glittering
                        eyes. I tried to
                        keep my voice level. “So why didn’t you bring the items to Kronos?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke’s smile wavered. “I…I got overconfident. Zeus sent out his sons and
                        daughters to find the
                        stolen bolt—Artemis, Apollo, my father, Hermes. But it was Ares who caught me. I could have
                        beaten him, but I
                        wasn’t careful enough. He disarmed me, took the items of power, threatened to return them to
                        Olympus and burn me
                        alive. Then Kronos’s voice came to me and told me what to say. I put the idea in Ares’s head
                        about a great war
                        between the gods. I said all he had to do was hide the items away for a while and watch the
                        others fight. Ares
                        got a wicked gleam in his eyes. I knew he was hooked. He let me go, and I returned to Olympus
                        before anyone
                        noticed my absence.” Luke drew his new sword. He ran his thumb down the flat of the blade, as if
                        he were
                        hypnotized by its beauty. “Afterward, the Lord of the Titans…h-he punished me with nightmares. I
                        swore not to
                        fail again. Back at Camp Half-Blood, in my dreams, I was told that a second hero would arrive,
                        one who could be
                        tricked into taking the bolt and the helm the rest of the way—from Ares down to Tartarus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">You </em>summoned the hellhound, that night in the
                        forest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We had to make Chiron think the camp wasn’t safe for you, so he would start
                        you on your quest.
                        We had to confirm his fears that Hades was after you. And it worked.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“The flying shoes were cursed,” I said. “They were supposed to drag me and the
                        backpack into
                        Tartarus.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“And they would have, if you’d been wearing them. But you gave them to the
                        satyr, which wasn’t
                        part of the plan. Grover messes up everything he touches. He even confused the curse.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke looked down at the scorpion, which was now sitting on my thigh. “You
                        should have died in
                        Tartarus, Percy. But don’t worry, I’ll leave you with my little friend to set things right.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Thalia gave her life to save you,” I said, gritting my teeth. “And this is how
                        you repay her?”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Don’t speak of Thalia!” he shouted. “The gods <em class="calibre5">let
                        </em>her die! That’s
                        one of the many things they will pay for.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’re being used, Luke. You and Ares both. Don’t listen to Kronos.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">I’ve </em>been used?” Luke’s voice turned shrill. “Look
                        at yourself. What
                        has your dad ever done for you? Kronos will rise. You’ve only delayed his plans. He will cast
                        the Olympians into
                        Tartarus and drive humanity back to their caves. All except the strongest—the ones who serve
                        him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Call off the bug,” I said. “If you’re so strong, fight me yourself.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Luke smiled. “Nice try, Percy. But I’m not Ares. You can’t bait me. My lord is
                        waiting, and
                        he’s got plenty of quests for me to undertake.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Luke—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Good-bye, Percy. There is a new Golden Age coming. You won’t be part of it.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He slashed his sword in an arc and disappeared in a ripple of darkness. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The scorpion lunged. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I swatted it away with my hand and uncapped my sword. The thing jumped at me
                        and I cut it in
                        half in midair. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was about to congratulate myself until I looked down at my hand. My palm had
                        a huge red welt,
                        oozing and smoking with yellow guck. The thing had gotten me after all. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My ears pounded. My vision went foggy. The water, I thought. It healed me
                        before. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stumbled to the creek and submerged my hand, but nothing seemed to happen.
                        The poison was too
                        strong. My vision was getting dark. I could barely stand up. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14"><em class="calibre5">Sixty seconds</em>, Luke had told me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I had to get back to camp. If I collapsed out here, my body would be dinner for
                        a monster.
                        Nobody would ever know what had happened. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">My legs felt like lead. My forehead was burning. I stumbled toward the camp,
                        and the nymphs
                        stirred from their trees. </p>

                    <p class="calibre14">“Help,” I croaked. “Please…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Two of them took my arms, pulling me along. I remember making it to the
                        clearing, a counselor
                        shouting for help, a centaur blowing a conch horn. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Then everything went black. </p>
                    <p class="calibre15"></p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p class="calibre13">I woke with a drinking straw in my mouth. I was sipping something that tasted
                        like liquid
                        chocolate-chip cookies. Nectar. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I opened my eyes. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I was propped up in bed in the sickroom of the Big House, my right hand
                        bandaged like a club.
                        Argus stood guard in the corner. Annabeth sat next to me, holding my nectar glass and dabbing a
                        washcloth on my
                        forehead. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Here we are again,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You idiot,” Annabeth said, which is how I knew she was overjoyed to see me
                        conscious. “You
                        were green and turning gray when we found you. If it weren’t for Chiron’s healing…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Now, now,” Chiron’s voice said. “Percy’s constitution deserves some of the
                        credit.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He was sitting near the foot of my bed in human form, which was why I hadn’t
                        noticed him yet.
                        His lower half was magically compacted into the wheelchair, his upper half dressed in a coat and
                        tie. He smiled,
                        but his face looked weary and pale, the way it did when he’d been up all night grading Latin
                        papers. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“How are you feeling?” he asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Like my insides have been frozen, then microwaved.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Apt, considering that was pit scorpion venom. Now you must tell me, if you
                        can, exactly what
                        happened.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Between sips of nectar, I told them the story. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">The room was quiet for a long time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I can’t believe that Luke…” Annabeth’s voice faltered. Her expression turned
                        angry and sad.
                        “Yes. Yes, I <em class="calibre5">can </em>believe it. May the gods curse him.…He was never the
                        same after his
                        quest.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“This must be reported to Olympus,” Chiron murmured. “I will go at once.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Luke is out there right now,” I said. “I have to go after him.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron shook his head. “No, Percy. The gods—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Won’t even <em class="calibre5">talk </em>about Kronos,” I snapped. “Zeus
                        declared the matter
                        closed!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, I know this is hard. But you must not rush out for vengeance. You
                        aren’t ready.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I didn’t like it, but part of me suspected Chiron was right. One look at my
                        hand, and I knew I
                        wasn’t going to be sword fighting any time soon. “Chiron…your prophecy from the Oracle…it was
                        about Kronos,
                        wasn’t it? Was I in it? And Annabeth?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron glanced nervously at the ceiling. “Percy, it isn’t my place—” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You’ve been ordered not to talk to me about it, haven’t you?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">His eyes were sympathetic, but sad. “You will be a great hero, child. I will do
                        my best to
                        prepare you. But if I’m right about the path ahead of you…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Thunder boomed overhead, rattling the windows. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"
                        src="../../../assets/images/series/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians/book-1-scenes/22-6.png"
                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“All right!” Chiron shouted. “Fine!” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He sighed in frustration. “The gods have their reasons, Percy. Knowing too much
                        of your future
                        is never a good thing.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“We can’t just sit back and do nothing,” I said. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“<em class="calibre5">We </em>will not sit back,” Chiron promised. “But <em
                            class="calibre5">you </em>must be careful. Kronos wants you to come unraveled. He wants your
                        life disrupted,
                        your thoughts clouded with fear and anger. Do not give him what he wants. Train patiently. Your
                        time will come.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Assuming I live that long.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron put his hand on my ankle. “You’ll have to trust me, Percy. You will
                        live. But first you
                        must decide your path for the coming year. I cannot tell you the right choice.…” I got the
                        feeling that he had a
                        very definite opinion, and it was taking all his willpower not to advise me. “But you must
                        decide whether to
                        stay at Camp Half-Blood year-round, or return to the mortal world for seventh grade and be a
                        summer camper.
                        Think on that. When I get back from Olympus, you must tell me your decision.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wanted to protest. I wanted to ask him more questions. But his expression
                        told me there could
                        be no more discussion; he had said as much as he could. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll be back as soon as I can,” Chiron promised. “Argus will watch over you.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">He glanced at Annabeth. “Oh, and, my dear…whenever you’re ready, they’re here.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Who’s here?” I asked. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Nobody answered. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Chiron rolled himself out of the room. I heard the wheels of his chair clunk
                        carefully down the
                        front steps, two at a time. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth studied the ice in my drink. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What’s wrong?” I asked her. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Nothing.” She set the glass on the table. “I…just took your advice about
                        something.
                        You…um…need anything?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Yeah. Help me up. I want to go outside.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Percy, that isn’t a good idea.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I slid my legs out of bed. Annabeth caught me before I could crumple to the
                        floor. A wave of
                        nausea rolled over me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth said, “I told you…” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’m fine,” I insisted. I didn’t want to lie in bed like an invalid while Luke
                        was out there
                        planning to destroy the Western world. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed a step forward. Then another, still leaning heavily on Annabeth.
                        Argus followed us
                        outside, but he kept his distance. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">By the time we reached the porch, my face was beaded with sweat. My stomach had
                        twisted into
                        knots. But I had managed to make it all the way to the railing. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">It was dusk. The camp looked completely deserted. The cabins were dark and the
                        volleyball pit
                        silent. No canoes cut the surface of the lake. Beyond the woods and the strawberry fields, the
                        Long Island Sound
                        glittered in the last light of the sun. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“What are you going to do?” Annabeth asked me. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I don’t know.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I told her I got the feeling Chiron wanted me to stay year-round, to put in
                        more individual
                        training time, but I wasn’t sure that’s what I wanted. I admitted I’d feel bad about leaving her
                        alone, though,
                        with only Clarisse for company.…</p>
                    <p class="calibre14">Annabeth pursed her lips, then said quietly, “I’m going home for the year,
                        Percy.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I stared at her. “You mean, to your dad’s?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pointed toward the crest of Half-Blood Hill. Next to Thalia’s pine tree, at
                        the very edge
                        of the camp’s magical boundaries, a family stood silhouetted—two little children, a woman, and a
                        tall man with
                        blond hair. They seemed to be waiting. The man was holding a backpack that looked like the one
                        Annabeth had
                        gotten from Waterland in Denver. </p>
                    <img class="scene-img"

                        alt="Scene image" />
                    <p class="calibre14">“I wrote him a letter when we got back,” Annabeth said. “Just like you
                        suggested. I told him…I
                        was sorry. I’d come home for the school year if he still wanted me. He wrote back immediately.
                        We decided…we’d
                        give it another try.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“That took guts.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She pursed her lips. “You won’t try anything stupid during the school year,
                        will you? At
                        least…not without sending me an Iris-message?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I managed a smile. “I won’t go looking for trouble. I usually don’t have to.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“When I get back next summer,” she said, “we’ll hunt down Luke. We’ll ask for a
                        quest, but if
                        we don’t get approval, we’ll sneak off and do it anyway. Agreed?” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Sounds like a plan worthy of Athena.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">She held out her hand. I shook it. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“Take care, Seaweed Brain,” Annabeth told me. “Keep your eyes open.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“You too, Wise Girl.” </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I watched her walk up the hill and join her family. She gave her father an
                        awkward hug and
                        looked back at the valley one last time. She touched Thalia’s pine tree, then allowed herself to
                        be led over the
                        crest and into the mortal world. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">For the first time at camp, I felt truly alone. I looked out at Long Island
                        Sound and I
                        remembered my father saying, <em class="calibre5">The sea does not like to be restrained. </em>
                    </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I made my decision. </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">I wondered, if Poseidon were watching, would he approve of my choice? </p>
                    <p class="calibre14">“I’ll be back next summer,” I promised him. “I’ll survive until then. After
                        all, I am your
                        son.” I asked Argus to take me down to cabin three, so I could pack my bags for home. </p>
