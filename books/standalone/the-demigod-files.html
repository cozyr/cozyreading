                    <p class="no-indent">Dear Young Demigod, </p>
                    <br class="calibre1" />
                    <p>If you are reading this book, I can only apologize. Your life is about to get much more
                        dangerous.
                    </p>
                    <p>By now, you have probably realized that you are not a mortal. This book is meant to serve as an
                        inside look at the world of demigods that no regular human child would be allowed to see. As
                        senior scribe of Camp Half-Blood, I hope the top secret information within will give you some
                        tips and insights that may keep you alive in your training.
                    </p>
                    <p><i>The Demigod Files</i> contains three of Percy Jackson’s most dangerous adventures never before
                        committed to paper. You will learn how he encountered the immortal and terrible sons of Ares.
                        You will find out the truth about the bronze dragon, long considered to be only a Camp
                        Half-Blood legend. And you will discover how Hades gained a new secret weapon, and how Percy was
                        forced to play an unwitting part in its creation. These stories are not meant to terrify you,
                        but it is important that you realize just how perilous the life of a hero can be.
                    </p>
                    <p>Chiron has also given me clearance to share confidential interviews with some of our most
                        important campers, including Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, and Grover Underwood. Please keep in
                        mind that these interviews were given in strictest confidence. Share this information with any
                        non-demigod, and you may find Clarisse coming after you with her electric spear. Believe me, you
                        do not want that.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, I have enclosed artwork to assist with your orientation. You will find portraits of
                        several characters at Camp Half-Blood so you will recognize them when you meet them in person.
                        Annabeth Chase has allowed us to replicate her own camp trunk so you can get an idea of what to
                        pack for your first summer. There is also a map of camp, which I hope will keep you from getting
                        lost and eaten by monsters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Study these pages well, for your own adventures have only just begun. May the gods be with you,
                        young demigod!

                    <p class="no-indent"><b>I</b> was in fifth-period science class when I heard these noises outside.
                    </p>
                    <p><i>SCRAWK! OW! SCREECH! </i>“HIYA!” </p>
                    <p>Like somebody was getting attacked by possessed poultry, and believe me, that’s a situation I’ve
                        been in before.
                        Nobody else seemed to notice the commotion. We were doing a lab, so everybody was talking, and
                        it wasn’t hard
                        for me to go look out the window while I pretended to wash out my beaker. </p>
                    <p>Sure enough, there was a girl in the alley with her sword drawn. She was tall and muscular like a
                        basketball
                        player, with stringy brown hair and jeans and combat boots and a denim jacket. She was hacking
                        at a flock of
                        black birds the size of ravens. Feathers stuck out of her clothes in several places. A cut was
                        bleeding over her
                        left eye. As I watched, one of the birds shot a feather like an arrow, and it lodged in her
                        shoulder. She cursed
                        and sliced at the bird, but it flew away. </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, I recognized the girl. It was Clarisse, my old enemy from demigod camp. Clarisse
                        usually lived at
                        Camp Half-Blood year-round. I had no idea what she was doing on the Upper East Side in the
                        middle of a school
                        day, but she was obviously in trouble. She wouldn’t last much longer. </p>
                    <p>I did the only the thing I could. </p>
                    <p>“Mrs. White,” I said, “can I go to the restroom? I feel like I’m going to puke.” </p>
                    <p>You know how teachers tell you the magic word is <i>please</i>? That’s not true. The magic word
                        is <i>puke</i>.
                        It will get you out of class faster than anything else. </p>
                    <p>“Go!” Mrs. White said. </p>
                    <p>I ran out the door, stripping off my safety goggles and gloves and lab apron. I got out my best
                        weapon—a
                        ballpoint pen called Riptide. </p>
                    <p>Nobody stopped me in the halls. I exited by the gym. I got to the alley just in time to see
                        Clarisse smack a
                        devil bird with the flat of her sword like she was hitting a home run. The bird squawked and
                        spiraled away,
                        slamming against the brick wall and sliding into a trash can. That still left a dozen more
                        swarming around her.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Clarisse!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p>She glared at me in disbelief. “Percy? What are you doing—” </p>
                    <p>She was cut short by a volley of feather arrows that zipped over her head and impaled themselves
                        in the wall.
                    </p>
                    <p>“This is my school,” I told her. </p>
                    <p>“Just my luck,” Clarisse grumbled, but she was too busy fighting to complain much. </p>
                    <p>I uncapped my pen, which grew into a three-foot-long bronze sword, and joined the battle,
                        slashing at the birds
                        and deflecting their feathers off my blade. Together, Clarisse and I sliced and hacked until all
                        the birds were
                        reduced to piles of feathers on the ground. </p>
                    <p>We were both breathing hard. I had a few scratches, but nothing major. I pulled a feather arrow
                        out of my arm. It
                        hadn’t gone in very deep. As long as it wasn’t poison, I’d be okay. I took a baggie of ambrosia
                        out of my
                        jacket, where I always kept it for emergencies, broke a piece in half, and offered some to
                        Clarisse. </p>
                    <p>“I don’t need your help,” she muttered, but she took the ambrosia. </p>
                    <p>We swallowed a few bites—not too much, since the food of the gods can burn you to ashes if you
                        overindulge. I
                        guess that’s why you don’t see many fat gods. Anyway, in a few seconds our cuts and bruises had
                        disappeared.
                    </p>
                    <p>Clarisse sheathed her sword and brushed off her denim jacket. “Well . . . see you.” </p>
                    <p>“Hold up!” I said. “You can’t just run off.” </p>
                    <p>“Sure I can.” </p>
                    <p>“What’s going on? What are you doing away from camp? Why were those birds after you?” </p>
                    <p>Clarisse pushed me, or tried to. I was too accustomed to her tricks. I just sidestepped and let
                        her stumble past
                        me. </p>
                    <p>“Come on,” I said. “You just about got killed at my school. That makes it my business.” </p>
                    <p>“It does not!” </p>
                    <p>“Let me help.” </p>
                    <p>She took a shaky breath. I got the feeling she really wanted to punch me out, but at the same
                        time there was a
                        desperate look in her eyes, like she was in serious trouble. </p>
                    <p>“It’s my brothers,” she said. “They’re playing a prank on me.” </p>
                    <p>“Oh,” I said, not really surprised. Clarisse had lots of siblings at Camp Half-Blood. All of them
                        picked on each
                        other. I guess that was to be expected since they were sons and daughters of the war god, Ares.
                        “Which brothers?
                        Sherman? Mark?” </p>
                    <p>“No,” she said, sounding more afraid than I’d ever heard her. “My
                        immortal brothers.
                        Phobos and Deimos.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>We sat on a bench at the park while Clarisse told me the story. I wasn’t too worried about
                        getting back to
                        school. Mrs. White would just assume the nurse had sent me home, and sixth period was shop
                        class. Mr. Bell never
                        took attendance. </p>
                    <p>“So let me get this straight,” I said. “You took your dad’s car for a joyride, and now it’s
                        missing.” </p>
                    <p>“It’s not a car,” Clarisse growled. “It’s a war chariot! And he <i>told </i>me to take it out.
                        It’s like . . . a
                        test. I’m supposed to bring it back at sunset. But—” </p>
                    <p>“Your brothers carjacked you.” </p>
                    <p>“Chariot-jacked me,” she corrected. “They’re his regular charioteers, see. And they don’t like
                        anybody else
                        getting to drive. So they stole the chariot from me and chased me off with those stupid
                        arrow-throwing birds.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“Your dad’s pets?” </p>
                    <p>She nodded miserably. “They guard his temple. Anyway, if I don’t find the chariot . . .” </p>
                    <p>She looked like she was about to lose it. I didn’t blame her. I’d seen her dad, Ares, get mad
                        before, and it was
                        not a pretty sight. If Clarisse failed him, he would come down hard on her. <i>Real </i>hard.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I’ll help you,” I said. </p>
                    <p>She scowled. “Why would you? I’m not your friend.” </p>
                    <p>I couldn’t argue with that. Clarisse had been mean to me a million times, but still, I didn’t
                        like the idea of
                        her or anybody else getting beat up by Ares. I was trying to figure out how to explain that to
                        her when a guy’s
                        voice said, “Aw, look. I think she’s been crying!” </p>
                    <p>A teenage dude was leaning against a telephone pole. He was dressed in ratty jeans, a black
                        T-shirt, and a
                        leather jacket, with a bandanna over his hair. A knife was stuck in his belt. He had eyes the
                        color of flames.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Phobos.” Clarisse balled her fists. “Where’s the chariot, you jerk?” </p>
                    <p>“<i>You </i>lost it,” he teased. “Don’t ask me.” </p>
                    <p>“You little—” </p>
                    <p>Clarisse drew her sword and charged, but Phobos disappeared as she swung, and her blade bit into
                        the telephone
                        pole. </p>
                    <p>Phobos appeared on the bench next to me. He was laughing, but he stopped when I stuck Riptide’s
                        point against his
                        throat. </p>
                    <p>“You’d better return that chariot,” I told him, “before I get mad.” </p>
                    <p>He sneered and tried to look tough, or as tough as you can with a sword under your chin. “Who’s
                        your little
                        boyfriend, Clarisse? You have to get help fighting your battles now?” </p>
                    <p>“He’s not my boyfriend!” Clarisse tugged her sword, pulling it out of the telephone pole. “He’s
                        not even my
                        friend. That’s Percy Jackson.” </p>
                    <p>Something changed in Phobos’s expression. He looked surprised, maybe even nervous. “The son of
                        Poseidon? The one
                        who made Dad angry? Oh, this is too good, Clarisse. You’re hanging out with a sworn enemy?” </p>
                    <p>“I’m not hanging out with him!” </p>
                    <p>Phobos’s eyes glowed bright red. </p>
                    <p>Clarisse screamed. She swatted the air as if she were being attacked by invisible bugs. “Please,
                        no!” </p>
                    <p>“What are you doing to her?” I demanded. </p>
                    <p>Clarisse backed up into the street, swinging her sword wildly. </p>
                    <p>“Stop it!” I told Phobos. I dug my sword a little deeper against his throat, but he simply
                        vanished, reappearing
                        back at the telephone pole. </p>
                    <p>“Don’t get so excited, Jackson,” Phobos said. “I’m just showing her what she fears.” </p>
                    <p>The glow faded from his eyes. </p>
                    <p>Clarisse collapsed, breathing hard. “You creep,” she gasped. “I’ll . . . I’ll get you.” </p>
                    <p>Phobos turned toward me. “How about you, Percy Jackson? What do <i>you </i>fear? I’ll find out,
                        you know. I
                        always do.” </p>
                    <p>“Give the chariot back.” I tried to keep my voice even. “I took on your dad once. You don’t scare
                        me.” </p>
                    <p>Phobos laughed. “Nothing to fear but fear itself. Isn’t that what they say? Well, let me tell you
                        a little
                        secret, half-blood. I <i>am </i>fear. If you want to find the chariot, come and get it. It’s
                        across the water.
                        You’ll find it where the little wild animals live—just the sort of place you belong.” </p>
                    <p>He snapped his fingers and disappeared in a curtain of yellow vapor. </p>
                    <p>Now, I’ve got to tell you, I’ve met a lot of godlings and monsters I didn’t like, but Phobos took
                        the prize. I
                        don’t like bullies. I’d never been in the “A” crowd at school, so I’d spent most of my life
                        standing up to punks
                        who tried to frighten me and my friends. The way Phobos laughed at me and made Clarisse collapse
                        just by looking
                        at her . . . I wanted to teach this guy a lesson. </p>
                    <p>I helped Clarisse up. Her face was still beaded with sweat. </p>
                    <p>“<i>Now </i>are you ready for help?” I asked. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>We took the subway, keeping a lookout for more attacks, but no one bothered us. As we rode,
                        Clarisse told me
                        about Phobos and Deimos. </p>
                    <p>“They’re minor gods,” she said. “Phobos is fear. Deimos is terror.” </p>
                    <p>“What’s the difference?” </p>
                    <p>She frowned. “Deimos is bigger and uglier, I guess. He’s good at freaking out entire crowds.
                        Phobos is more,
                        like, personal. He can get inside your head.” </p>
                    <p>“That’s where they get the word <i>phobia</i>?” </p>
                    <p>“Yeah,” she grumbled. “He’s so proud of that. All those phobias named after him. The jerk.” </p>
                    <p>“So why don’t they want you driving the chariot?” </p>
                    <p>“It’s usually a ritual just for Ares’s sons when they turn fifteen. I’m the first daughter to get
                        a shot in a
                        long time.” </p>
                    <p>“Good for you.” </p>
                    <p>“Tell that to Phobos and Deimos. They hate me. I’ve <i>got </i>to get the chariot back to the
                        temple.” </p>
                    <p>“Where <i>is </i>the temple?” </p>
                    <p>“Pier 86. The <i>Intrepid</i>.” </p>
                    <p>“Oh.” It made sense, now that I thought about it. I’d never actually been on board the old
                        aircraft carrier, but
                        I knew they used it as some kind of military museum. It probably had a bunch of guns and bombs
                        and other
                        dangerous toys. Just the kind of place a war god would want to hang out. </p>
                    <p>“We’ve got maybe four hours before sunset,” I guessed. “That should be enough time if we can find
                        the chariot.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“But what did Phobos mean, ‘over the water’? We’re on an island, for Zeus’s sake. That could be
                        any direction!”
                    </p>
                    <p>“He said something about wild animals,” I remembered. “Little wild animals.” </p>
                    <p>“A zoo?” </p>
                    <p>I nodded. A zoo over the water could be the one in Brooklyn, or maybe . . . someplace harder to
                        get to, with
                        <i>little </i>wild animals. Someplace nobody would ever think to look for a war chariot.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Staten Island,” I said. “They’ve got a small zoo.” </p>
                    <p>“Maybe,” Clarisse said. “That sounds like the kind of out-of-the-way place Phobos and Deimos
                        would stash
                        something. But if we’re wrong—” </p>
                    <p>“We don’t have time to be wrong.” </p>
                    <p>We hopped off the train at Times Square and caught the Number 1
                        downtown, toward the
                        ferry terminal. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>We boarded the Staten Island Ferry at three thirty, along with a bunch of tourists, who crowded
                        the railings of
                        the top deck, snapping pictures as we passed the Statue of Liberty. </p>
                    <p>“He modeled that after his mom,” I said, looking up at the statue. </p>
                    <p>Clarisse frowned at me. “Who?” </p>
                    <p>“Bartholdi,” I said. “The dude who made the Statue of Liberty. He was a son of Athena, and he
                        designed it to look
                        like his mom. That’s what Annabeth told me, anyway.” </p>
                    <p>Clarisse rolled her eyes. Annabeth was my best friend and a huge nut when it came to architecture
                        and monuments.
                        I guess her egghead facts rubbed off on me sometimes. </p>
                    <p>“Useless,” Clarisse said. “If it doesn’t help you fight, it’s useless information.” </p>
                    <p>I could’ve argued with her, but just then the ferry lurched like it had hit a rock. Tourists
                        spilled forward,
                        tumbling into each other. Clarisse and I ran to the front of the boat. The water below us
                        started to boil. Then
                        the head of a sea serpent erupted from the bay. </p>
                    <p>The monster was at least as big as the boat. It was gray and green with a head like a crocodile
                        and razor-sharp
                        teeth. It smelled . . . well, like something that had just come up from the bottom of New York
                        Harbor. Riding on
                        its neck was a bulky guy in black Greek armor. His face was covered with ugly scars, and he held
                        a javelin in
                        his hand. </p>
                    <p>“Deimos!” Clarisse yelled. </p>
                    <p>“Hello, sister!” His smile was almost as horrible as the serpent’s. “Care to play?” </p>
                    <p>The monster roared. Tourists screamed and scattered. I don’t know exactly what they saw. The Mist
                        usually
                        prevents mortals from seeing monsters in their true form, but whatever they saw, they were
                        terrified. </p>
                    <p>“Leave them alone!” I yelled. </p>
                    <p>“Or <i>what</i>, son of the sea god?” Deimos sneered. “My brother tells me you’re a wimp!
                        Besides, I love terror.
                        I live on terror!” </p>
                    <p>He spurred the sea serpent into head-butting the ferry, which sloshed backward. Alarms blared.
                        Passengers fell
                        over each other trying to get away. Deimos laughed with delight. </p>
                    <p>“That’s it,” I grumbled. “Clarisse, grab on.” </p>
                    <p>“What?” </p>
                    <p>“Grab on to my neck. We’re going for a ride.” </p>
                    <p>She didn’t protest. She grabbed on to me, and I said, “One, two, three—JUMP!” </p>
                    <p>We leaped off the top deck and straight into the bay, but we were only under water for a moment.
                        I felt the power
                        of the ocean surging through me. I willed the water to swirl around me, building force until we
                        burst out of the
                        bay on top of a thirty-foot-high waterspout. I steered us straight toward the monster. </p>
                    <p>“You think you can tackle Deimos?” I yelled to Clarisse. </p>
                    <p>“I’m on it!” she said. “Just get me within ten feet.” </p>
                    <p>We barreled toward the serpent. Just as it bared its fangs, I swerved the waterspout to one side,
                        and Clarisse
                        jumped. She crashed into Deimos, and both of them toppled into the sea. </p>
                    <p>The sea serpent came after me. I quickly turned the waterspout to face him, then summoned all my
                        power and willed
                        the water to even greater heights. </p>
                    <p><i>WHOOOOM! </i></p>
                    <p>Ten thousand gallons of salt water crashed into the monster. I leaped over its head, uncapped
                        Riptide, and
                        slashed with all my might at the creature’s neck. The monster roared. Green blood spouted from
                        the wound, and
                        the serpent sank beneath the waves. </p>
                    <p>I dove under water and watched as it retreated back to the open sea. That’s one good thing about
                        sea serpents:
                        they’re big babies when it comes to getting hurt. </p>
                    <p>Clarisse surfaced near me, spluttering and coughing. I swam over and grabbed her. </p>
                    <p>“Did you get Deimos?” I asked. </p>
                    <p>Clarisse shook her head. “The coward disappeared as we were wrestling. But I’m sure we’ll see him
                        again. Phobos,
                        too.” </p>
                    <p>Tourists were still running around the ferry in a panic, but it didn’t look like anybody was
                        hurt. The boat
                        didn’t seem damaged. I decided we shouldn’t stick around. I held on to Clarisse’s arm and willed
                        the waves to
                        carry us toward Staten Island. </p>
                    <p>In the west, the sun was going down over the Jersey shore. We were
                        running out of
                        time. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>I’d never spent much time on Staten Island, and I found it was a lot bigger than I thought and
                        not much fun to
                        walk. The streets curved around confusingly, and everything seemed to be uphill. I was dry (I
                        never got wet in
                        the ocean unless I wanted to) but Clarisse’s clothes were still sopping wet, so she left mucky
                        footprints all
                        over the sidewalk, and the bus driver wouldn’t let us on the bus. </p>
                    <p>“We’ll never make it in time,” she sighed. </p>
                    <p>“Stop thinking that way.” I tried to sound upbeat, but I was starting to have doubts too. I
                        wished we had
                        reinforcements. Two demigods against two minor gods was not an even match, and when we met
                        Phobos and Deimos
                        together, I wasn’t sure what we were going to do. I kept remembering what Phobos had said:
                        <i>How about you,
                            Percy Jackson? What do you fear? I’ll find out, you know</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>After dragging ourselves halfway down the island, past a lot of suburban houses and a couple of
                        churches and a
                        McDonald’s, we finally saw a sign that said ZOO. We turned a corner and followed this curvy
                        street with some
                        woods on one side until we came to the entrance. </p>
                    <p>The lady at the ticket booth looked at us suspiciously, but thank the gods I had enough cash to
                        get us inside.
                    </p>
                    <p>We walked around the reptile house, and Clarisse stopped in her tracks. </p>
                    <p>“There it is.” </p>
                    <p>It was sitting at a crossroads between the petting zoo and the sea otter pond: a large golden and
                        red chariot
                        tethered to four black horses. The chariot was decorated with amazing detail. It would’ve been
                        beautiful if all
                        the pictures hadn’t shown people dying painful deaths. The horses were breathing fire out of
                        their nostrils.
                    </p>
                    <p>Families with strollers walked right past the chariot like it didn’t exist. I guess the Mist
                        must’ve been really
                        strong around it, because the chariot’s only camouflage was a handwritten note taped to one of
                        the horses’
                        chests that said OFFICIAL ZOO VEHICLE. </p>
                    <p>“Where are Phobos and Deimos?” Clarisse muttered, drawing her sword. </p>
                    <p>I couldn’t see them anywhere, but this had to be a trap. </p>
                    <p>I concentrated on the horses. Usually I could talk to horses, since my dad had created them. I
                        said, <i>Hey. Nice
                            fire-breathing horses. Come here! </i></p>
                    <p>One of horses whinnied disdainfully. I could understand his thoughts, all right. He called me
                        some names I can’t
                        repeat. </p>
                    <p>“I’ll try to get the reins,” Clarisse said. “The horses know me. Cover me.” </p>
                    <p>“Right.” I wasn’t sure how I was supposed to cover her with a sword, but I kept my eyes peeled as
                        Clarisse
                        approached the chariot. She walked around the horses, almost tiptoeing. </p>
                    <p>She froze as a lady with a three-year-old girl passed by. The girl said, “Pony on fire!” </p>
                    <p>“Don’t be silly, Jessie,” the mother said in a dazed voice. </p>
                    <p>“That’s an official zoo vehicle.” </p>
                    <p>The little girl tried to protest, but the mother grabbed her hand and they kept walking. Clarisse
                        got closer to
                        the chariot. Her hand was six inches from the rail when the horses reared up, whinnying and
                        breathing flames.
                        Phobos and Deimos appeared in the chariot, both of them now dressed in pitch-black battle armor.
                        Phobos grinned,
                        his red eyes glowing. Deimos’s scarred face looked even more horrible up close. </p>
                    <p>“The hunt is on!” Phobos yelled. Clarisse stumbled back as he lashed the horses and charged the
                        chariot straight
                        toward me. </p>
                    <p>Now, I’d like to tell you that I did something heroic, like stand up against a raging team of
                        fire-breathing
                        horses with only my sword. The truth is, I ran. I jumped over a trash bin and an exhibit fence,
                        but there was no
                        way I could outrun the chariot. It crashed through the fence right behind me, plowing down
                        everything in its
                        path. </p>
                    <p>“Percy, look out!” Clarisse yelled, like I needed somebody to tell me that. </p>
                    <p>I jumped and landed on a rock island in the middle of the otter exhibit. I willed a column of
                        water out of the
                        pond and doused the horses, temporarily extinguishing their flames and sending them into
                        confusion. The otters
                        weren’t happy with me. They chattered and barked, and I figured I’d better get off their island
                        quick, before I
                        had crazed sea mammals after me too. </p>
                    <p>I ran as Phobos cursed and tried to get his horses under control. Clarisse took the opportunity
                        to jump on
                        Deimos’s back just as he was lifting his javelin. Both of them went tumbling out of the chariot
                        as it lurched
                        forward. </p>
                    <p>I could hear Deimos and Clarisse starting to fight, sword on sword, but I didn’t have time to
                        worry about it
                        because Phobos was riding after me again. I sprinted toward the aquarium with the chariot right
                        behind me. </p>
                    <p>“Hey, Percy!” Phobos taunted. “I’ve got something for you!” </p>
                    <p>I glanced back and saw the chariot melting, the horses turning to steel and folding into each
                        other like clay
                        figures being crumpled. The chariot refashioned itself into a black metal box with caterpillar
                        treads, a turret,
                        and a long gun barrel. A tank. I recognized it from this research report I’d had to do for
                        history class. Phobos
                        was grinning at me from the top of a World War II panzer. </p>
                    <p>“Say cheese!” he said. </p>
                    <p>I rolled to one side as the gun fired. </p>
                    <p><i>KA-BOOOOM! </i>A souvenir kiosk exploded, sending fuzzy animals and plastic cups and
                        disposable cameras in
                        every direction. As Phobos re-aimed his gun, I got to my feet and dived into the aquarium. </p>
                    <p>I wanted to surround myself with water. That always increased my power. Besides, it was possible
                        Phobos couldn’t
                        fit the chariot inside the doorway. Of course, if he blasted through it, that wouldn’t help. . .
                        . </p>
                    <p>I ran through the rooms washed in weird blue light from the fish tank exhibits. Cuttlefish, clown
                        fish, and eels
                        all stared at me as I raced past. I could hear their little minds whispering, <i>Son of the sea
                            god! Son of the
                            sea god! </i>It’s great when you’re a celebrity to squids. </p>
                    <p>I stopped at the back of the aquarium and listened. I heard nothing. And then . . . <i>Vroom</i>,
                        <i>Vroom</i>. A
                        different kind of engine.
                    </p>
                    <p>I watched in disbelief as Phobos came riding through the aquarium on a Harley-Davidson. I’d seen
                        this motorcycle
                        before: its black flame-decorated engine, its shotgun holsters, its leather seat that looked
                        like human skin.
                        This was the same motorcycle Ares had ridden when I’d first met him, but it had never occurred
                        to me that it was
                        just another form of his war chariot. </p>
                    <p>“Hello, loser,” Phobos said, pulling a huge sword out of its sheath. “Time to be scared.” </p>
                    <p>I raised my own sword, determined to face him, but then Phobos’s eyes glowed brighter, and I made
                        the mistake of
                        looking into them. </p>
                    <p>Suddenly I was in a different place. I was at Camp Half-Blood, my favorite place in the world,
                        and it was in
                        flames. The woods were on fire. The cabins were smoking. The dining pavilion’s Greek columns had
                        crumbled, and
                        the Big House was a smoldering ruin. My friends were on their knees pleading with me. Annabeth,
                        Grover, all the
                        other campers. </p>
                    <p><i>Save us, Percy! </i>they wailed. <i>Make the choice! </i></p>
                    <p>I stood paralyzed. This was the moment I had always dreaded: the prophecy that was supposed to
                        come about when I
                        was sixteen. I would make a choice that would save or destroy Mount Olympus. </p>
                    <p>Now the moment was here, and I had no idea what to do. The camp was burning. My friends looked at
                        me, begging for
                        help. My heart pounded. I couldn’t move. What if I did the wrong thing? </p>
                    <p>Then I heard the voices of the aquarium fish: <i>Son of the sea god! Wake! </i></p>
                    <p>Suddenly I felt the power of the ocean all around me again, hundreds of gallons of salt water,
                        thousands of fish
                        trying to get my attention. I wasn’t at camp. This was an illusion. Phobos was showing me my
                        deepest fear. </p>
                    <p>I blinked and saw Phobos’s blade coming down toward my head. I raised Riptide and blocked the
                        blow just before it
                        cut me in two. </p>
                    <p>I counterattacked and stabbed Phobos in the arm. </p>
                    <p>Golden ichor, the blood of the gods, soaked through his shirt. </p>
                    <p>Phobos growled and slashed at me. I parried easily. Without his power of fear, Phobos was
                        nothing. He wasn’t even
                        a decent fighter. I pressed him back, swiped at his face, and gave him a cut across the cheek.
                        The angrier he
                        was, the clumsier he got. I couldn’t kill him. He was immortal. But you wouldn’t have known that
                        from his
                        expression. The fear god looked afraid. </p>
                    <p>Finally I kicked him backward against the water fountain. His sword skittered into the ladies
                        room. I grabbed the
                        straps of his armor and pulled him up to face me. </p>
                    <p>“You’re going to disappear now,” I told him. “You’re going to stay out of Clarisse’s way. And if
                        I see you again,
                        I’m going to give you a bigger scar in a much more painful place!” </p>
                    <p>He gulped. “There will be a next time, Jackson!” </p>
                    <p>And he dissolved into yellow vapor. </p>
                    <p>I turned toward the fish exhibits. “Thanks, guys.” </p>
                    <p>Then I looked at Ares’s motorcycle. I’d never ridden an all-powerful
                        Harley-Davidson
                        war chariot before, but how hard could it be? I hopped on, started the ignition, and rode out of
                        the aquarium to
                        help Clarisse. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>I had no trouble finding her. I just followed the path of destruction. Fences were knocked down.
                        Animals were
                        running free. Badgers and lemurs were checking out the popcorn machine. A fat-looking leopard
                        was lounging on a
                        park bench with a bunch of pigeon feathers around him. </p>
                    <p>I parked the motorcycle next to the petting zoo, and there were Deimos and Clarisse in the goat
                        area. Clarisse
                        was on her knees. I ran forward but stopped suddenly when I saw how Deimos had changed form. He
                        was Ares now—
                        the tall god of war, dressed in black leather and sunglasses, his whole body smoking with anger
                        as he raised his
                        fist over Clarisse. </p>
                    <p>“You failed me again!” the war god bellowed. “I told you what would happen!” </p>
                    <p>He tried to strike her, but Clarisse scrambled away, shrieking, “No! Please!” </p>
                    <p>“Foolish girl!” </p>
                    <p>“Clarisse!” I yelled. “It’s an illusion. Stand up to him!” </p>
                    <p>Deimos’s form flickered. “I am Ares!” he insisted. “And you are a worthless girl! I knew you
                        would fail me. Now
                        you will suffer my wrath.” </p>
                    <p>I wanted to charge in and fight Deimos, but somehow I knew it wouldn’t help. Clarisse had to do
                        it. This was her
                        worst fear. She had to overcome it for herself. </p>
                    <p>“Clarisse!” I said. She glanced over, and I tried to hold her eyes. “Stand up to him!” I said.
                        “He’s all talk.
                        Get up!” </p>
                    <p>“I . . . I can’t.” </p>
                    <p>“Yes, you can. You’re a warrior. Get up!” </p>
                    <p>She hesitated. Then she began to stand. </p>
                    <p>“What are you doing?” Ares bellowed. “Grovel for mercy, girl!” </p>
                    <p>Clarisse took a shaky breath. Very quietly, she said, “No.” </p>
                    <p>“WHAT?” </p>
                    <p>She raised her sword. “I’m tired of being scared of you.” </p>
                    <p>Deimos struck, but Clarisse deflected the blow. She staggered but didn’t fall. </p>
                    <p>“You’re not Ares,” Clarisse said. “You’re not even a good fighter.” </p>
                    <p>Deimos growled in frustration. When he struck again, Clarisse was ready. She disarmed him and
                        stabbed him in the
                        shoulder—not deep, but enough to hurt even a godling. </p>
                    <p>He yowled in pain and began to glow. </p>
                    <p>“Look away!” I told Clarisse. </p>
                    <p>We averted our eyes as Deimos exploded into golden light—his true godly form—and disappeared.
                    </p>
                    <p>We were alone except for the petting zoo goats, which were tugging at our clothes, looking for
                        snacks. </p>
                    <p>The motorcycle had turned back into a horse-drawn chariot. </p>
                    <p>Clarisse looked at me cautiously. She wiped the straw and sweat off her face. “You didn’t see
                        that. You didn’t
                        see any of that.” </p>
                    <p>I grinned. “You did good.” </p>
                    <p>She glanced at the sky, which was turning red behind the trees. </p>
                    <p>“Get in the chariot,” Clarisse said. “We’ve still got a long ride to
                        make.” </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>A few minutes later we reached the Staten Island Ferry and remembered something obvious: we were
                        on an island.
                        The ferry didn’t take cars. Or chariots. Or motorcycles. </p>
                    <p>“Great,” Clarisse mumbled. “What do we do now? Ride this thing across the Verrazano Bridge?” </p>
                    <p>We both knew there wasn’t time. There were bridges to Brooklyn and New Jersey, but either way it
                        would take hours
                        to drive the chariot back to Manhattan, even if we could fool people into thinking it was a
                        regular car. </p>
                    <p>Then I got an idea. “We’ll take the direct route.” </p>
                    <p>Clarisse frowned. “What do you mean?” </p>
                    <p>I closed my eyes and began to concentrate. “Drive straight ahead. Go!” </p>
                    <p>Clarisse was so desperate she didn’t hesitate. She yelled, “Hiya!” and
                        lashed the
                        horses. They charged straight toward the water. I imagined the sea turning solid, the waves
                        becoming a firm
                        surface all the way to Manhattan. The war chariot hit the surf, the horses’ fiery breath smoking
                        all around us,
                        and we rode the tops of the waves straight across New York Harbor. </p>
                    <hr class="scene-break" />
                    <p>We arrived at Pier 86 just as the sunset was fading to purple. The USS <i>Intrepid</i>, temple of
                        Ares, was a
                        huge wall of gray metal in front of us, the flight deck dotted with fighter aircraft and
                        helicopters. We parked
                        the chariot on the ramp, and I jumped out. For once I was glad to be on dry land. Concentrating
                        on keeping the
                        chariot above the waves had been one of the hardest things I’d ever done. I was exhausted. </p>
                    <p>“I’d better get out of here before Ares arrives,” I said. </p>
                    <p>Clarisse nodded. “He’d probably kill you on sight.” </p>
                    <p>“Congratulations,” I said. “I guess you passed your driving test.” </p>
                    <p>She wrapped the reins around her hand. “About what you saw, Percy. What I was afraid of, I mean—”
                    </p>
                    <p>“I won’t tell anybody.” </p>
                    <p>She looked at me uncomfortably. “Did Phobos scare you?” </p>
                    <p>“Yeah. I saw the camp in flames. I saw my friends all pleading for my help, and I didn’t know
                        what to do. For a
                        second, I couldn’t move. I was paralyzed. I know how you felt.” </p>
                    <p>She lowered her eyes. “I, uh . . . I guess I should say. . .” </p>
                    <p>The words seemed to stick in her throat. I wasn’t sure Clarisse had ever said thank you in her
                        life. “Don’t
                        mention it,” I told her. I started to walk away, but she called out, “Percy?” “Yeah?” “When you,
                        uh, had that
                        vision about your friends . . .” “You were one of them,” I promised. “Just don’t tell anybody,
                        okay? Or I’d have
                        to kill you.” A faint smile flickered across her face. “See you later.” “See you.” I headed off
                        toward the
                        subway. It had been a long day, and I was ready to get home. </p>
