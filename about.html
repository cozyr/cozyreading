            <h2>About this site</h2>
            <p>
                Cozy Reading is a personal project where I collect books I’m reading (or planning to read) and present
                them
                in a
                focused, distraction-free layout. Each book opens into a simple reader with a chapter bar so you can
                jump
                directly to any chapter and keep your place without scrolling endlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is comfort: clean typography, soft motion, and a quiet interface that feels more like a small
                library
                than a typical website.
            </p>

            <h2>What you’ll find here</h2>
            <p>
                This collection started with Percy Jackson, but it’s no longer limited to one series. I’m gradually
                adding
                more
                books across different genres and authors as my reading list grows.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some titles may look “in progress” or partially available—that simply means I haven’t finished building
                that
                book’s chapter content yet.
